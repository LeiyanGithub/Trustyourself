Ron Bottcher was an American operatic baritone who performed with both the New York City Opera (NYCO) and the Metropolitan Opera during the 1960s. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, he earned music degrees from the University of Montana and the Curtis Institute of Music. Bottcher made his debut at the Santa Fe Opera in 1961, where he portrayed roles such as Leopold in Richard Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier, Marcello in Giacomo Puccini's La bohème, and the Head Waiter in Paul Hindemith's Neues vom Tage. At the NYCO, he performed in works such as Escamillo in Georges Bizet's Carmen and Sharpless in Puccini's Madama Butterfly, among others. Bottcher also created roles in the world premieres of Samuel Barber's Antony and Cleopatra and Marvin David Levy's Mourning Becomes Electra at the Met. He died at the age of 50 due to AIDS-related illness.

La bohème (also known as La bohème de Puccini) is a 1988 Italian-French film of an opera directed by Luigi Comincini, based on Giacomo Puccini's La bohème. Gianni Schicchi is a comic opera in one act by Puccini, with a libretto by Giovacchino Forzano, composed in 1917-18. The work is the third and final part of Puccini's Il trittico (The Triptych) - three one-act operas with contrasting themes. Although it is often performed alone or with short operas by other composers, Gianni Schicchi is celebrated for its powerhouse voice, electrifying top notes, clear timbre, passionate singing, and remarkable performances. O mio babbino caro is a soprano aria from Puccini's Gianni Schicchi, sung by Lauretta after tensions between her father and the family of Rinuccio, the boy she loves, have reached a breaking point. The aria provides an interlude expressing lyrical simplicity and single-hearted love in contrast with the atmosphere of hypocrisy, jealousy, double-dealing, and feuding in the medieval Florence of Puccini's only comedy.

Fanciulla del West (The Girl of the West) is an opera in three acts by Puccini, based on the play The Girl of the Golden West by David Belasco. The opera has fewer show-stopping highlights than Puccini's other works, but is admired for its impressive orchestration and score that is more melodically integrated. Tosca is a 1956 Italian musical film directed by Carmine Gallone, starring Franca Duval, Afro Poli, and Franco Corelli. It is based on the opera Tosca by Puccini. Cesira Ferrani was an Italian operatic soprano who debuted two iconic roles in opera history - Mimì in the original production of La bohème and the title role in Manon Lescaut in its 1893 world premiere. Ferrani sang a wide repertoire that included verismo opera, as well as works by composers like Verdi, Gounod, Wagner, and Debussy. Jacopo Puccini (1712-16 May 1781) was an 18th-century Italian composer who lived and worked primarily in Lucca, Tuscany. He was the first of five generations of composers, with the most famous being his great-great-grandson, the opera composer Giacomo Puccini.

Fokienia is a genus of coniferous tree belonging to the cypress family, characterized as being intermediate between the genera Chamaecyparis and Calocedrus. While some botanists recognize Fokienia as a distinct genus, others do not, with Fokienia being considered a subgenus of Chamaecyparis. The genus consists of only one living species, Fokienia hodginsii, also known as Fujian cypress, and one fossil species, Fokienia ravenscragensis. The Frenchman Formation, a stratigraphic unit of Late Cretaceous age in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, contains the youngest dinosaur genera, similar to the Hell Creek Formation in the United States. Ajuga, a genus of 40 species of annual and perennial herbaceous flowering plants in the mint family Lamiaceae, is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, but also has species in southeastern Australia. The common name cypress is applied to several genera within the family Cupressaceae, including Cupressus, which is considered a polyphyletic group. The genus is found in the Cupressoideae subfamily and is characterized by the presence of cedrol, a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the essential oil of conifers. Libocedrus is a genus of five species of coniferous trees native to New Zealand and New Caledonia, closely related to the South American genera Pilgerodendron and Austrocedrus, and the New Guinean genus Papuacedrus. Pilgerodendron is a genus of conifer endemic to the Valdivian temperate rain forests and Magellanic subpolar forests of southern Chile and southwestern Argentina. Cypress-pine is the common name used for three closely related genera of conifers in the cypress family Cupressaceae: Ajugeae, a tribe of the Teucrioideae subfamily of the family Lamiaceae, which might contain the genera Acrymia, Ajuga, Cymaria, Garrettia, and Holocheila.

They play in the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The Hornets were first established in 1988 as an expansion team, but relocated to New Orleans following the 2001–02 season.  In 2004, a new expansion team, the Charlotte Bobcats, was established.  After 10 seasons as the Bobcats, the team changed its name to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 season, a year after the New Orleans franchise relinquished the Hornets name and renamed itself the Pelicans.  In addition to re-inheriting the Hornets name from New Orleans, the Charlotte franchise reclaimed the history and records of the original 1988–2002 Hornets, effectively becoming a continuation of the original franchise. The Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball team, representing Texas Tech University, has had 9 players drafted into the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) since the league began holding drafts in 1997.  Sheryl Swoopes was Texas Tech's first player drafted in the WNBA, selected in the 1997 Initial Player Allocation.  The Charlotte Sting had drafted three Lady Raiders, more than any other WNBA franchise: Michi Atkins, in the WNBA Elite Draft, and Angie Braziel and Jia Perkins during the college draft. The 1992–93 NBA season was the fifth season for the Charlotte Hornets in the National Basketball Association.  In the 1992 NBA draft, the Hornets selected center Alonzo Mourning out of Georgetown with the second overall pick.  With the addition of Mourning, along with second-year star Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues, the Hornets struggled around .500 for most of the season, but won 9 of their final 12 games finishing their season third in the Central Division with a 44–38 record, and qualified for their first ever playoff appearance.  The team became the first of the four expansion franchises of the late 1980s to win a playoff series, when Mourning sunk a 20 ft jumper at the buzzer in Game 4 of the first round playoff series against the 4th-seeded Boston Celtics.  However, in the semifinals, the Hornets were eliminated by the New York Knicks in five games. The original Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) were established in 1988 as an expansion team, based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The team's roster was filled with unprotected players at the 1988 NBA Expansion Draft, and five days later the Hornets made their first picks out of college players at the 1988 NBA draft.  The Hornets remained in Charlotte for 14 seasons before relocating to New Orleans in 2002.  Two years after the Hornets' departure, the Charlotte Bobcats were established in 2004.  The Bobcats first participated in the 2004 NBA draft, two days after their expansion draft was held.  The franchise's name was changed back to the Hornets at the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, one year after the team in Louisiana renamed itself the New Orleans Pelicans.  The history and records of the original Charlotte Hornets were conveyed to the newly named Charlotte Hornets. Ayana D’Nay Walker (born September 10, 1979) is an American former women's basketball player.  She played for the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters basketball team from 1998 to 2002.  Walker was a member of gold-medal winning USA Basketball Women’s National Team in 2001 and set a USA single-game record with 19 rebounds in gold-medal game.  She was also a member of gold-medal winning USA Basketball World University Games Team in 2001.  Walker was drafted as the 20th overall pick by the Detroit Shock in the 2002 WNBA Draft.  As a member of the Shock, she won the 2003 WNBA Championship.  On July 3, 2005, Walker signed with the Charlotte Sting.  After the Sting franchise folded, Walker was drafted by Los Angeles Sparks as the 12th pick in the dispersal draft on January 8, 2007.  She returned to Detroit for her final season in 2007. The 2003 WNBA Season was the Women's National Basketball Association's seventh season.  It was first season in which teams either folded or relocated, as well as the first to have teams that were not co-owned with NBA teams.  The Orlando Miracle relocated to Connecticut and became the Connecticut Sun, the Utah Starzz relocated to San Antonio, Texas and became the San Antonio Silver Stars.  Meanwhile, both the Miami Sol and the Portland Fire folded, while the Charlotte Sting became the second WNBA team without a brother NBA team.  The schedule increased from 32 games per team to 34, where it stands to this day.  The season ended with the Detroit Shock winning their first WNBA Championship. The Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball club based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  They are members of the National Basketball Association (NBA), playing in the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference.  The original Charlotte Hornets franchise played in Charlotte from 1988–2002 before relocating to New Orleans, Louisiana and becoming the New Orleans Hornets.  A new franchise, the Charlotte Bobcats, began play in the 2004–05 season.  The team played for ten seasons as the Bobcats before adopting the Hornets name for the 2014–15 season.  The Hornets name was left available after the New Orleans Hornets became the New Orleans Pelicans.  As part of a deal between the Bobcats, Hornets and NBA, the renamed Hornets reclaimed the original Hornets' history and records from 1988 to 2002, while all of the Hornets' records from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans.  As a result, the Hornets are now reckoned as having suspended operations after the 2001–02 season before returning as the Bobcats in 2004; This has allowed all of Charlotte's NBA history to be recognized under one single franchise. The Charlotte Hornets are an American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The Hornets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Southeast Division.  The team is largely owned by former NBA player and North Carolina native Michael Jordan, who acquired controlling interest in the team in 2010.

It was later published in New York in 1921 as part of another collection entitled Monday or Tuesday. Emma Bull (born December 13, 1954) is an American science fiction and fantasy author.  Her novels include the Hugo- and Nebula-nominated Bone Dance and the urban fantasy War for the Oaks.

Adeline Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882 – 28 March 1941) was an English writer who is considered one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century, and a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device.  Born in an affluent household in Kensington, London, she attended the King's College London and was acquainted with the early reformers of women's higher education. Orlando: A Biography is a novel by Virginia Woolf, first published on 11 October 1928.  A high-spirited romp inspired by the tumultuous family history of Woolf's lover and close friend, the aristocratic poet and novelist Vita Sackville-West, it is arguably one of Woolf's most popular novels: a history of English literature in satiric form.  The book describes the adventures of a poet who changes sex from man to woman and lives for centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history.  Considered a feminist classic, the book has been written about extensively by scholars of women's writing and gender and transgender studies. Me!  I'm Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a 1978 television play by Alan Bennett, produced by London Weekend Television and directed by Stephen Frears.  The title of the play is a parody of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? , which in turn plays on the title of the Disney song Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? . Rev Dr Jane de Gay is a British academic and lecturer who has earned a reputation as an expert on the life and works of Virginia Woolf.  Dr de Gay's works on Woolf include a series of articles and a 2006 book, Virginia Woolf's Novels and the Literary Past, published by Edinburgh University Press.  Her work has been recognised by the Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain.  She has co-edited four books on gender and theatre, including Languages of Theatre Shaped by Women (with Lizbeth Goodman). Freshwater is a two-act chamber opera composed by Andy Vores, based on the 1929 comic play by Virginia Woolf.  Vores received assistance in creating the opera from Quentin Bell, Woolf's nephew and executor, who provided a rarely seen earlier version of the text that served as the inspiration for several passages of the libretto. The Duchess and the Jeweller (1938) is a short story by Virginia Woolf.  Woolf, being an advocate of addressing the stream of consciousness, shows the thoughts and actions of a greedy jeweller; Woolf makes a thematic point that corrupt people do corrupt actions for purely selfish motives (and often without regret).  It was first published in British Harper's Bazaar Magazine in April 1938 and subsequently published posthumously in 1944 in the collection A Haunted House and Other Short Stories. Moments of Being is a collection of posthumously-published autobiographical essays by Virginia Woolf.  The collection was first found in the papers of her husband, used by Quentin Bell in his biography of Virginia Woolf, published in 1972.  In 1976, the essays were edited for publication by Jeanne Schulkind.  The second edition was published in 1985.  The original texts are now housed at Sussex University and in the British Library in London. Jane Marcus (1938–2015) was a pioneering feminist literary scholar, specializing in women writers of the Modernist era, but especially in the social and political context of their writings.  Focusing on Virginia Woolf, Rebecca West, and Nancy Cunard, among many others, she devised groundbreaking analyses of Woolf's writings, upending a generation of criticism that ignored feminist, pacifist, and socialist themes in much of Woolf's work and critique of imperialism and bourgeois society.  Marcus's understanding of Woolf's place within the larger context of English literature has become prevailing wisdom today in the fields affected by her theorization and research, despite the controversial nature of her positions when they were originally formulated and how much opposition she garnered from earlier scholars and critics.

As of 2014, there are over than 4,000 men in the Netherlands with this as their first name, and nearly 3,000 with it as their middle name.  It was likely derived from Bernard.  Notable people with the name include: Marion Christopher Barry was born in June 1980 to Marion Barry and Barry's third wife, Effi Slaughter Barry.  He was their only child.  His father had wanted to name him Marion Barry III, but Effi was strongly opposed, and they decided to give him the middle name Christopher instead.  For most of his adult life, Barry went by his middle name, Christopher. Suburban Madness is an American crime drama television film, based on a true story, starring Sela Ward as PI Bobbi Bacha of Blue Moon Investigations.  It aired on CBS on October 3, 2004. Latvian names, like in most European cultures, consist of two main elements: the given name (vārds) followed by family name (uzvārds).  During the Soviet occupation (1940 - 1991) the practice of giving a middle name was discouraged, but since the restoration of Independence Latvian legislation again allows giving of up to two given names and it has become more common to give a middle name to children.

Singh is a title, middle name or surname, which originated in India.  Derived from the Sanskrit word for lion, it was adopted as a title by certain warrior castes in India.  It was mandated by Guru Gobind Singh for all Sikhs.  It was later adopted by several castes and communities.  As a surname or a middle name, it is now found throughout the Indian subcontinent and among the Indian diaspora, cutting across communities and religious groups, becoming more of a title than a surname. Bobbi Bacha is a Texas Private Investigator portrayed in 2004 TV Sony Pictures Movie Suburban Madness played by actress Sela Ward.  Bobbi Bacha also was involved and worked on the case of New York millionaire Robert Durst who was charged with murder in Galveston, Texas for killing his neighbor Morris Black but was found not guilty by a Galveston County Jury. Jeff Strabone is a Brooklyn-based American scholar, political activist and civic leader.  In 2016, his website directelection.org listed the names and addresses of members of the U.S. Electoral College, and he urged people to write to electors to ask them not to vote for president-elect Donald Trump, an effort which brought him national attention.

In several cultures, people's names usually include one or more names in addition to the portion that is usually considered adequate to identify them.  In a number of cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, such a name is likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called a middle name.

The High Commission of Australia in London is the Australian diplomatic mission located in the United Kingdom. It is situated in Australia House, a Grade II listed building, and is both Australia's first diplomatic mission and the longest continuously occupied diplomatic mission in the UK. A diplomatic mission, also known as a foreign mission, is a group of people from one state or organization present in another state to represent their home government or organization officially. In practice, a diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, such as an embassy, which is the office of a country's diplomatic representatives in the capital city of another country. The physical concept of a diplomatic bag can take many forms, such as a cardboard box, briefcase, duffel bag, or large suitcase, and may contain articles intended for official use. The bag has diplomatic immunity from search or seizure, as codified in Article 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The Embassy of China in London is the Chinese diplomatic mission in the UK, established in 1877 as the Chinese Legation. It has served as the diplomatic mission of the Qing Empire, Republic of China, and People's Republic of China. The embassy has been the focal point for events related to China held in the UK, including celebrations in 2012 to commemorate 40 years of diplomatic relations between the UK and China. Alvaro Mexia was a Spanish explorer and cartographer who mapped the east coast of Florida in the 17th century. He was stationed in St Augustine and was given a diplomatic mission to the native populations living south of St. Augustine and in the Cape Canaveral area. This mission resulted in a period of friendship between the Spanish and the Ais native population. The US diplomatic mission to Kenya is based in Nairobi and was established in 1964 when the US established diplomatic relations with Kenya. The embassy has been the target of a terrorist attack in 1998, after which a new embassy building was constructed in a suburb of Nairobi in 2003. The US diplomatic mission to Somalia is also based at the Nairobi embassy. Azerbaijan initiated diplomatic relations with Western and other countries since the Safavids dynasty in the 16th century, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was established in 1918 when Azerbaijan was formed as a republic for the first time. The diplomatic delegation of the Republic attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. After Azerbaijan restored its independence on February 5, 1991, the country started to create bilateral relations with other countries, and the diplomatic missions were established in foreign countries. In diplomatic usage, the term "head of mission" or "chief of mission" refers to the head of a diplomatic representation, such as an ambassador, high commissioner, nuncio, chargé d'affaires, permanent representative, and to a consul-general or consul. The United States Mission to the European Union is the diplomatic mission of the US to the European Union, based in Brussels, Belgium, and has maintained diplomatic relations with the EU and its predecessors since 1953. The indigenous peoples of Florida lived in what is now known as Florida for over 12,000 years before the time of first contact with Europeans, but most had died out by the early 18th century. Some Apalachees migrated to Louisiana, while others were taken to Cuba and Mexico by the Spanish in the 18th century, and a few may have been absorbed into the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes.

Together with Han Vermeulen, he is co-convenor of the recently established History of Anthropology Network of the EASA. Participant observation is one type of data collection method typically used in qualitative research.  It is a widely used methodology in many disciplines, particularly cultural anthropology and (European) ethnology, less so in sociology, communication studies, human geography and social psychology.  Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, sub cultural group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their cultural environment, usually over an extended period of time.  The method originated in the field research of social anthropologists, especially Bronisław Malinowski and his students in Britain, the students of Franz Boas in the United States, and in the later urban research of the Chicago School of sociology. Muted group theory (MGT) is developed by social anthropologists Edwin Ardener and Shirley Ardener in 1975.  The theory describes the relationship between a dominant group and its subordinate group(s): As the dominant group contributes mostly to the formulation of the language system, including the norms and vocabulary, members from the subordinate group have to learn and use the dominant-made language to express themselves.  However, this translation process may result in loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly.  The dominant may also ignore the voice of the lower-power.  All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group.  Although this theory is initially developed to study the different situations faced by women and men, it can also be applied to any marginalized group that is muted by the inadequacies of their languages. The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth, is a learned society in the United Kingdom dedicated to promoting the academic discipline of psychosocial studies.  It is a member of the Academy of Social Sciences. Alfred Antony Francis Gell, {'1': , '2': , '3': , '4': } ( ; June 12, 1945 – January 28, 1997) was a British social anthropologist whose most influential work concerned art, language, symbolism and ritual.  He was trained by Edmund Leach (MPhil, Cambridge University) and Raymond Firth (PhD, London School of Economics) and did his fieldwork in Melanesia and tribal India.  Gell taught at the London School of Economics, among other places.  He was also a Fellow of the British Academy.  He died of cancer in 1997, at the age of 51. Coral Gardens and Their Magic, properly Coral Gardens and Their Magic: A Study of the Methods of Tilling the Soil and of Agricultural Rites in the Trobriand Islands, is the final book in anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski's ethnographic trilogy on the lives of the Trobriand Islanders.  It concentrates on the cultivation practices the Trobriand Islanders used to grow yams, taro, bananas and palms.  It describes the gardens in which the Trobrianders grew food as more than merely utilitarian spaces, even as works of art.  In 1988 Alfred Gell called the book still the best account of any primitive technological-cum-magical system, and unlikely ever to be superseded in this respect.  The book has been described as Malinowski's magnum opus. [/INST]

He is a software tester by profession, and also runs a slot car business and racing facility. Miner Memorial Library is the public library of Lempster, New Hampshire, located at 3 Second New Hampshire Turnpike.  The library occupies a single-story wood frame structure built in 1845 as a church for a Universalist congregation.  Despite significant alteration for its use as a library, the building remains a fine example of vernacular church architecture in Sullivan County.  The building was formally dedicated in 1927 to the memory of Lempster native Alonzo Ames Miner, a leading Universalist minister and president of Tufts College.  After years of declining attendance, the remaining congregants gave the building to the town in 1965.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Sullivan County is a county located in the U.S. state of New Hampshire.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 43,742, making it the second-least populous county in New Hampshire.  Its county seat is Newport. Dover is a city in Strafford County, New Hampshire, United States.  The population was 29,987 at the 2010 census, the largest in the New Hampshire Seacoast region.  The population was estimated at 31,153 in 2016.  It is the county seat of Strafford County, and home to Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, the Woodman Institute Museum, and the Children's Museum of New Hampshire. Woodsville is a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Haverhill in Grafton County, New Hampshire, U.S., along the Connecticut River at the mouth of the Ammonoosuc River.  The population was 1,126 at the 2010 census.  Although North Haverhill is now the county seat of Grafton County, the village of Woodsville has traditionally been considered the county seat, as the county courthouse was originally located there.  The county buildings are now located halfway between Woodsville and the village of North Haverhill to the south. Hampden County is a non-governmental county located in the Pioneer Valley of the state of Massachusetts, in the United States.  As of the 2010 census, Hampden County's population was 463,490.  Its traditional county seat is Springfield, the Connecticut River Valley's largest city, and economic and cultural capital.  Hampden County was split from Hampshire County in 1812, because Northampton, Massachusetts, was made Hampshire County's shire town in 1794; however, Springfield—theretofore Hampshire County's traditional shire town, dating back to its founding in 1636—grew at a pace far quicker than Northampton and was granted shire town-status over its own, southerly jurisdiction.  It was named for John Hampden.  To the north of Hampden County is modern-day Hampshire County; to the west is Berkshire County; to the east is Worcester County; to the south are Litchfield County, Hartford County, and Tolland County in Connecticut. Carroll County is a county located in the state of New Hampshire, in the United States.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 47,818, making it the third-least populous county in New Hampshire.  Its county seat is Ossipee.  The county was created in 1840 and organized at Ossipee from towns removed from Strafford County.  It was named in honor of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who had died in 1832, the last surviving signer of the United States Declaration of Independence. East Lempster is an unincorporated community in the town of Lempster in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The Gardnerville Branch Jail is a historic jail located at 1440 Courthouse St. in Gardnerville, Nevada.  The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915.  Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary.  As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail.  However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself.  Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail.  The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him.  Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail. Lempster is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States.  The population was 1,154 at the 2010 census.  Settlements include the town center (Lempster village) and the village of East Lempster. [/INST]

Inspecting the parade was the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces General of the Army Ivan Svyda.  The commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Colonel General Gennady Vorobyov, Commanded the Parade.  The President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych delivered a jubilee address.  2,500 members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces troops from Russia and Belarus took part in the parade.  17 military orchestras took part in the parade under the command of the Chief of the Military Music Department of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Major General Volodymyr Derkach. Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) , was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.  After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only.  Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional.  (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.)  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed. One Rank One Pension (OROP), or same pension, for same rank, for same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement, is a longstanding demand of the Indian armed forces and veterans.  The demand for pay-pension equity, which underlies the OROP concept, was provoked by the exparte decision by the Indira Gandhi-led Indian National Congress (INC) government, in 1973, two years after the historic victory in the 1971 Bangladesh war, and shortly after Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw retired, to decrease armed forces pensions by 20–40 percent, and increase civilian pensions by 20 percent, without consultation with armed forces headquarters.  <ref name=V Mahalingam, 21/9> </ref> The Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS; French: chef d'état-major de la Défense ) is the second most senior member of the Canadian Armed Forces (after the commander-in-chief) and heads the Armed Forces Council, having primary responsibility for command, control, and administration of the forces, as well as military strategy, plans, and requirements.

The 16 September military parade in honour of the anniversary of Mexican Independence is an annual tradition dating back to the late 19th century and the beginning of the professionalisation of the Mexican Armed Forces in the 20th century.  Held yearly in the Zócalo in Mexico City, this parade, the largest of the various parades held simultaneously nationwide on September 16, Mexican Independence Day, is presided by the President of Mexico in the fulfillment of his duty as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.  It is also attended by members of the Cabinet of Mexico, the Congress of the Union, civil service employees, the Secretaries of National Defense and Navy, members of the Mexican Armed Forces and Federal Police, uniformed service veterans, the state diplomatic corps, delegations representing the religious sector, indigenous peoples, sports and the private sector, and the general public.  Seen on TV and the Internet and heard on radio, this is one of the biggest events of the year.  Taking part in this are members of the Mexican Armed Forces and the Federal Police. Fernando Tapias Stahelin (born July 14, 1943 - † September 27, 2015) was a General (retired) of Colombian Armed Forces.  He served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of Colombian Armed Forces for a period of four years (1998–2002) during the presidential term of president Andres Pastrana.  After that, he served as ambassador of Colombia in Dominican Republic from 2002 to 2004 and subsequently served as Deputy Minister of Defense for its social and business group for two years from 2009 to 2010 during the presidential term of president Alvaro Uribe.  He was in the Colombian Armed Forces for 41 years, achieving all the military ranks all the way up to his appointment as General Commander for the Colombian Armed Forces. Conscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars).  The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.  However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed. The Military Covenant or Armed Forces Covenant is a term introduced in 2000 into British public life to refer to the mutual obligations between the nation and its Armed Forces.  According to The Guardian, it is an informal understanding, rather than a legally enforceable deal, but it is nevertheless treated with great seriousness within the services.  It was coined in , and has now entered political discourse as a way of measuring whether the government and society at large have kept to their obligations to support members of the armed forces. Armed Forces Day, known also as the Feast of the Polish Armed Forces (Polish: Święto Wojska Polskiego ), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw during the Polish–Soviet War.  Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, itself a separate public holiday.  The event is marked by military parades, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the Polish Armed Forces across the country.  One of the most prominent events of the day is in the capital Warsaw, which hosts a large military parade through the city's center.  Originally celebrated during the Second Republic, the holiday was barred by authorities during the communist era beginning in 1947, only to be revived again in 1992. In June 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC).  It was the most important federal move in support of the rights of African-Americans between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The President's order stated that the federal government would not hire any person based on their race, color, creed, or national origin.  The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts.  Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result.  The war brought the race issue to the forefront.  The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War.  But by 1940, the African-American vote had largely shifted from Republican to Democrat, and African-American leaders like Walter Francis White of the NAACP and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League had become recognized as part of the Roosevelt coalition.  In June 1941, at the urging of A. Philip Randolph, the leading African-American trade unionist, Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee and prohibiting discrimination by any government agency, including the armed forces.  In practice the services, particularly the Navy and the Marines, found ways to evade this order — the Marine Corps remained all-white until 1942.  In September 1942, at Eleanor's instigation, Roosevelt met with a delegation of African-American leaders, who demanded full integration into the forces, including the right to serve in combat roles and in the Navy, the Marine Corps and the United States Army Air Forces.  Roosevelt agreed, but then did nothing to implement his promise.  It was left to his successor, Harry S. Truman, to fully desegregate the armed forces. [/INST]

Centered on the town of El Nacimiento in Múzquiz Municipality, the group are descendants of Black Seminoles escaping the threat of slavery in the United States. Dhoolpet is one of the old suburbs in Hyderabad, India.  It is part of the old city of Hyderabad.  This place is inhabited by people who migrated from Uttar Pradesh during the Nizam rule.  The Nizam helped these people settle in this area.  The area is notorious for bootlegging and has witnessed attacks on policemen or excise department officials during raids. Seminole music is the music of the Seminole people, an indigenous people of the Americas who formed in Florida in the 18th century.  Today most live in Oklahoma, but a minority continue in Florida.  They have three federally recognized tribes, and some people belong to bands outside those groups.  Their traditional music includes extensive use of rattles, hand drums, water drums, and flutes. The Seminole are a Native American people originally from Florida.  Today, they principally live in Oklahoma with a minority in Florida, and comprise three federally recognized tribes: the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, as well as independent groups.  The Seminole nation emerged in a process of ethnogenesis from various Native American groups who settled in Florida in the 18th century, most significantly northern Muscogee (Creeks) from what is now Georgia and Alabama.  The word Seminole is derived from the Creek word simanó-li, which may be itself be derived from the Spanish word cimarrón, menaning runaway or wild one. The history of draining and development of the Everglades dates back to the 19th century.  During the Second Seminole War beginning in 1836, the United States military's mission was to seek out Seminole people in the Everglades and capture or kill them.  Those missions gave the military the opportunity to map land that seemed to frustrate and confound them at every turn.  A national push for expansion and progress toward the latter part of the 19th century stimulated interest in draining the Everglades for agricultural use.  According to historians, From the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, the United States went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned.  Indeed, it was considered the proper thing to do. The Muscogee language (Mvskoke in Muscogee), also known as Creek, Seminole, Maskókî or Muskogee, is a Muskogean language spoken by Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole people, primarily in the U.S. states of Oklahoma and Florida. Seminole County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 25,482.  Its county seat is Wewoka.  Before Oklahoma's admission as a state, the county was the entire small portion of Indian Territory allocated to the Seminole people, who were removed from Florida in the 1820s. The Battle of Jupiter Inlet occurred on January 15, 1838, between the Seminole Indians - Seminole Negro and the United States Navy.  This was the first of a series of battles led by the US Navy in the area, also referred to as the First Battle of Loxahatchee.  The battle started when Lt. Levin Powell led an expedition of 200 soldiers, sailors and marines, down the east coast of Florida.  The Navy spotted a trail alongside the Jupiter Inlet, and seventy-five men were landed to find the Seminole camp nearby.  The camp was led by Sam Jones, Ar-pi-uck-i, the spiritual medicine and war chief of the Miccosukee and Seminole people during the war.  The officers that advanced on the camp were outnumbered and ambushed.  After a long fight, the US retreated with five men killed in action and about twenty others wounded.  Ltn.  Powell was one of those killed in battle. The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma is a federally recognized Native American tribe based in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.  It is the largest of the three federally recognized Seminole governments, which include the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida.  Its members are descendants of the 3,000 Seminoles who were forcibly removed from Florida to Indian Territory, along with 800 Black Seminoles, after the Second Seminole War.  The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma is headquartered in Wewoka within Seminole County, Oklahoma.  Of 18,800 enrolled tribal members, 13,533 live within the state of Oklahoma.  The tribe began to revive its government in 1936 under the Indian Reorganization Act.  While its reservation was originally larger, today the tribal jurisdictional area covers Seminole County, Oklahoma, within which it has a variety of properties. The Black Seminoles are black Indians associated with the Seminole people in Florida and Oklahoma.  They are the descendants of free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida.  Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole.  Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes, including the right to bear arms.

response:    Here is a rewritten version of the passage that preserves the semantics of the original while using more varied and nuanced language:

The Mascogos, also known as the Negros Mascagos, are an Afro-descendant community located in Coahuila, Mexico. They are the descendants of Black Seminoles who escaped slavery in the United States and sought refuge in Mexico during the 19th century. The town of El Nacimiento in Múzquiz Municipality serves as the center of this community.

Dhoolpet, an old suburb in Hyderabad, India, is home to a group of people who migrated from Uttar Pradesh during the Nizam rule. The Nizam provided them with land and support to settle in this area. However, the area has been known for its criminal activities, including bootlegging and attacks on law enforcement officials.

Seminole music is a unique genre that originated from the Seminole people, an indigenous group from Florida. Today, most Seminoles reside in Oklahoma, but a small number remain in Florida. The Seminole Nation is made up of three federally recognized tribes: the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. These tribes have their own distinct cultural practices and traditions.

The history of the Everglades region dates back to the 19th century, when the United States military launched a campaign to eliminate the Seminole people living in the area. This campaign led to the mapping of the land and the displacement of the Seminole people. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, there was a national push for the draining and development of the Everglades for agricultural purposes.

The Muscogee language, also known as Creek or Seminole, is spoken by the Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole people living in Oklahoma and Florida. Seminole County, Oklahoma, is home to the majority of the Seminole people, and it was originally designated as the land set aside for the Seminole people during the period of Indian removal. The Battle of Jupiter Inlet took place on January 15, 1838, between the Seminole Indians and the United States Navy. This battle was the first of several fought in the area, known as the First Battle of Loxahatchee.

Overall, the passage highlights the complex history and cultural heritage of the Seminole people, including their origins, migration patterns, and cultural practices. It also provides context for the conflicts and struggles that the Seminole people have faced throughout history, including the forced relocation from Florida to Indian Territory and the subsequent development of the Everglades region.

The Flaming Feather (1952) is a Technicolor Western film directed by Ray Enright and starring Sterling Hayden, which was shot on location in Oak Creek Canyon and Montezuma Castle National Monument near Sedona, Arizona. The local Yavapai Indians refused to enter the cliff dwellings due to their cultural beliefs, causing a delay in production. To overcome this obstacle, a band of Navajos was brought in from a reservation 137 miles away to replace them. Château de Druyes is a medieval castle located in Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, France, built in the 12th century by the Counts of Nevers. Shamayim, the Hebrew word for heaven, refers to one of the three components of the cosmos, along with erets (the earth) and sheol (the underworld). The Sinagua people built and lived in Montezuma Castle National Monument in Camp Verde, Arizona between 1100 and 1425 AD. In Norse mythology, Andlang is the second heavenly realm that stretches between the first and third heavens, containing the halls of the gods. The Tabernacle, according to the Hebrew Bible, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God among the Israelites, built with layers of curtains and furnished with valuable materials. Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem superseded it as God's dwelling place some 300 years later. In zoology, an inquiline is an animal that lives commensally in the nest, burrow, or dwelling place of another animal. Examples include insects that live in the homes of gophers and feed on debris, fungi, and roots. Víðbláinn is the third heaven in Norse mythology, located above Andlang and Asgard, and serving as a shelter and dwelling place for the souls of the dead during and after Ragnarök. The designation of the oldest synagogue in the United Kingdom requires careful definition, as many synagogues predate the expulsion of Jews from England but have been used for other purposes or destroyed and rebuilt. The designation of the oldest synagogue in the world also requires careful definition, as many very old synagogues have been discovered in archaeological digs, but some have been used for other purposes or destroyed and rebuilt, and some have been in continuous use for many centuries.

It is a popular children's song in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and Canada, and is often sung by children on bus trips to keep themselves amused.  It has a very repetitive rhythm, making the song easy for a large number of people to sing, in a manner similar to the song 99 Bottles of Beer.  It is based on fellow traditional British song Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush.  The song is also sometimes sung to the tune of Buffalo Gals, as in the version done by Raffi. Roy Holder (born 15 June 1946) is an English television actor who has appeared in various programmes including Ace of Wands, Z-Cars, Spearhead, the Doctor Who serial The Caves of Androzani and Sorry!  His first notable appearance on the screen was in the 1961 film Whistle Down the Wind, and he then appeared in The Taming of the Shrew (1967), Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush (1967), Romeo and Juliet (1968), The Virgin Soldiers (1969), Loot (1970), Psychomania (1973), The Land That Time Forgot (1975), Trial by Combat (1976) and Jesus of Nazareth (1977).  More recently, Roy played the part of Mr Hill in Pride & Prejudice (2005), and Gaffer Tom in Robin Hood (2010). Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush (also titled Mulberry Bush or This is the Way) is an English language nursery rhyme and singing game.  It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 7882.  The same tune is also used for Lazy Mary, Will You Get Up and a variant is used for The Wheels on the Bus. Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush is a single by Traffic.  It is the title song to the film Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, and features all four members of Traffic singing a joint lead, though the bridge and parts of the chorus have Steve Winwood singing unaccompanied.  The single uses an edited version of the song, with the intro removed.  When released in late 1967, the single cracked the UK Top 10.  Footage of the band acting out the song was commissioned by The Beatles for possible inclusion in the film Magical Mystery Tour but was not used in the final edit.  It is now included in the special features of the 2012 DVD/Blu-ray edition of the film. Michael Finnegan (variant spellings include Michael Finnagen and Michael Vinnegan) is an example of an unboundedly long song, which can continue with numerous variations until the singer decides (or is forced) to stop.  Like most other perpetual songs, this song tends to be sung by schoolchildren.  It is a popular song often sung around a campfire or during scouting events.  The origin of the words and music is unknown, but the tune bears similarity to Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush.  The earliest documented reference is The Hackney Scout Song Book (Stacy & Son Ltd, 1921).  It also appears in The Oxford song book, vol.2, collected and arranged by Thomas Wood (Oxford University Press, 1927). Edward Hunter Davies, OBE (born 7 January 1936) is a British author, journalist and broadcaster.  He is the author of a number of books, including the only authorised biography of the Beatles. Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush is a 1967 British film made based on the novel of the same name by Hunter Davies.

It is a colorless, flammable chemical compound with a strong odor.  As a propyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms, sometimes shown as (CH)CHOH.  It is a structural isomer of 1-propanol.  It has a wide variety of industrial and household uses, and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants and detergents. Alcohol is any organic compound in which a hydroxyl functional group (-OH) is bound to a carbon atom, usually connected to other carbon or hydrogen atoms.  An important class are the simple acyclic alcohols, the general formula for which is CHOH.  Of those, ethanol (CHOH) is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, and in common speech the word alcohol refers specifically to ethanol.  Articles related to alcohol include: Shellite (known as Tridite in US service) is an explosive mixture of Picric acid and Dinitrophenol or Picric acid and Hexanitrodiphenylamine in a ratio of 70/30.  It was typically used as a filling in Royal Navy armour-piercing shells during the early part of the 20th century. Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride (THPC) is an organophosphorus compound with the chemical formula [P(CHOH)]Cl.  The cation P(CHOH) is four-coordinate, as is typical for phosphonium salts. THPC has applications as a precursor to fire-retardant materials. 1-Hexanol is an organic alcohol with a six-carbon chain and a condensed structural formula of CH(CH)OH.  This colorless liquid is slightly soluble in water, but miscible with diethyl ether and ethanol.  Two additional straight chain isomers of 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, exist, both of which differing by the location of the hydroxyl group.  Many isomeric alcohols have the formula CHOH.  It is used in the perfume industry. 1-Pentanol, (or n-pentanol, pentan-1-ol), is an alcohol with five carbon atoms and the molecular formula CHOH.  1-Pentanol is a colorless liquid with an unpleasant aroma.  It is the straight-chain form of amyl alcohol, one of 8 isomers with that formula. An aldonic acid is any of a family of sugar acids obtained by oxidation of the aldehyde functional group of an aldose to form a carboxylic acid functional group.  Thus, their general chemical formula is HOOC-(CHOH)-CHOH.  Oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group instead of the terminal aldehyde yields a uronic acid, while oxidation of both terminal ends yields an aldaric acid. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener.  The name derives from Greek: ξύλον , xyl[on], wood + suffix -itol, used to denote sugar alcohols.  Xylitol is categorized as a polyalcohol or sugar alcohol (alditol).  It has the formula CHOH(CHOH)CHOH and is an achiral isomer of pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol.  Multiple studies using electron microscopy have indicated that xylitol is effective in inducing remineralization of deeper layers of demineralized enamel.  Fair evidence was found that xylitol (as chewing gum, lozenges, nasal spray, etc.) reduced the incidence of acute middle ear infection in healthy children. In a mixture between a dielectric and a metallic component, the conductivity formula_1 and the dielectric constant formula_2 of this mixture show a critical behavior if the fraction of the metallic component reaches the percolation threshold.  The behavior of the conductivity near this percolation threshold will show a smooth change over from the conductivity of the dielectric component to the conductivity of the metallic component and can be described using two critical exponents s and t, whereas the dielectric constant will diverge if the threshold is approached from either side.  To include the frequency dependent behavior, a resistor-capacitor model (R-C model) is used. Picric acid is an organic compound with the formula (ON)CHOH.  Its IUPAC name is 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP).  The name picric comes from the Greek πικρός (pikros), meaning bitter, reflecting its bitter taste.  It is one of the most acidic phenols.  Like other highly nitrated organic compounds, picric acid is an explosive, which was once its primary use.  It has also been used in medicine (antiseptic, burn treatments) and dyes. [/INST]

In 1813 Mathilda married William Maitland, and their family continued to preside over the estate for most of the 19th Century.  Gelston then became the property of the Galliers-Pratts who retained the castle for pheasant shooting, and from whom it was requisitioned during World War II.  During this time it served as a home for handicapped boys evacuated from Glasgow, before the roof was removed once this use had ceased.

Keith Richards (born 18 December 1943) is an English guitarist, singer, songwriter, and author, best known as a founder member of the rock band the Rolling Stones.  Rolling Stone magazine credited Richards for rock's greatest single body of riffs on guitar and ranked him 4th on its list of 100 best guitarists.  Fourteen songs that Richards wrote with the Rolling Stones' lead vocalist Mick Jagger are listed among Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.  The Stones are generally known for their guitar interplay of rhythm and lead (weaving) between Richards and Brian Jones, Mick Taylor and Ronnie Wood over the years.  In spite of this, Richards plays the only guitar tracks on some of their most famous songs including Paint It Black, Ruby Tuesday, Sympathy for the Devil and Gimme Shelter. Gimme Shelter is the opening track to the 1969 album Let It Bleed by the Rolling Stones.  Although the first word was spelled Gimmie on that album, subsequent recordings by the band and other musicians have made Gimme the customary spelling.  Greil Marcus, writing in Rolling Stone magazine at the time of its release, praised the song, stating that the band has never done anything better. [/INST]

Jonathan Meath (born September 16, 1955) is an American TV producer based in Boston who is notable for children's television production.  He was Senior Producer of the TV game show Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?  He produced Zoom (1999) and The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss.  He co-founded a production company called Andanzura.  In addition, he is notable for having a dual career as a professional Santa Claus.  He made numerous appearances in various media as Santa, including ABC's Good Morning America show, and at New York's Radio City Music Hall with The Rockettes.  He appeared on the cover of Boston Magazine as Father Christmas.  He was described by National Public Radio and Time Magazine as a top Santa, and appeared as Santa in a Delta Airline's in-flight safety video.  He is featured as Santa in Coca-Cola’s worldwide 2016 holiday advertising campaign both in print and commercials titled “A Coke for Christmas. Rankin/Bass Productions, Inc. (founded as Videocraft International, Ltd.) was an American production company, known for its seasonal television specials, particularly its work in stop motion animation.  The pre-1974 library is owned by Universal Studios (via DreamWorks Animation/DreamWorks Classics), while the post-1973 library is owned by Warner Bros. Rankin/Bass stop-motion features are recognisable by their visual style of doll-like characters with spheroid body parts, and ubiquitous powdery snow using an animation technique called Animagic.  Often, traditional cel animation scenes of falling snow would be projected over the action to create the effect of a snowfall. Santa Claus: The Movie (known on-screen as simply Santa Claus) is a 1985 British-American Christmas film starring Dudley Moore, John Lithgow, and David Huddleston in the title role.  It is the last major fantasy film produced by the Paris-based father-and-son production team of Alexander and Ilya Salkind.  The film was directed by Jeannot Szwarc and released in North America on November 27, 1985, by TriStar Pictures.  The 2005 DVD release was released by Anchor Bay Entertainment, now known as Starz Home Entertainment, under license from the film's current owner, StudioCanal; however, the current, 25th Anniversary home video release (which also now includes Blu-ray) is by Lionsgate Home Entertainment, again under StudioCanal's license. Santa Claus Is a Black Man is a Christmas song by record producer and songwriter Teddy Vann, performed by his daughter Akim Vann (billed as Akim) and his Teddy Vann Production Company for a 1973 single.

The Year Without a Santa Claus is a 1974 Christmas stop motion animated television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions.  The story is based on Phyllis McGinley's 1956 book of the same name, illustrated by Kurt Werth.  It was originally broadcast on December 10, 1974 on ABC. A Miser Brothers' Christmas is a stop motion spin-off special based on some of the characters from the 1974 Rankin-Bass special The Year Without a Santa Claus.  Distributed by Warner Bros.  Animation under their Warner Premiere label (the rights holders of the post-1974 Rankin-Bass library) and Toronto-based Cuppa Coffee Studios, the one-hour special premiered on ABC Family on Saturday, December 13, 2008, during the network's annual The 25 Days of Christmas programming.  Mickey Rooney and George S. Irving reprised their respective roles as Santa Claus and Heat Miser at ages 88 and 86.  Snow Miser, originally portrayed by Dick Shawn who died in 1987, was voiced by Juan Chioran, while Mrs. Claus, voiced by Shirley Booth in the original, was portrayed by Catherine Disher (because Booth had died in 1992).  The movie aimed to emulate the Rankin/Bass animation style.  This is the last Christmas special to feature Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus, as he died in 2014, as well as the last time George Irving voiced Heat Miser, as he died in 2016. Motion pictures featuring Santa Claus abound and apparently constitute their own subgenre of the Christmas film genre.  Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children.  In 1897, in a short film called Santa Claus Filling Stockings, Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys.  Another film called Santa Claus and the Children was made in 1898.  A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith in titled Santa Claus (or The Visit from Santa Claus in the United Kingdom) was created.  In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree.  He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children.  After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney.  Santa Claus' Visit in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers.  The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room.  Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children.  He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace.  He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts.  The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch him by the legs.  A 1909 film by D. W. Griffith titled A Trap for Santa Claus shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers she inherited a fortune.  A twenty-nine-minute 1925 silent film production titled Santa Claus, by explorer/documentarian Frank E. Kleinschmidt, filmed partly in northern Alaska, feature Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer.  A year later, another movie titled Santa Claus was produced with sound on De Forest Phonofilm.  Over the years, various actors have donned the red suit (aside from those discussed below), including Monty Woolley in Life Begins at Eight-thirty (1942), Alberto Rabagliati in The Christmas That Almost Wasn't (1966), Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places (1983), Jan Rubes in One Magic Christmas (1985), David Huddleston in  (1985), Jonathan Taylor Thomas in I'll Be Home for Christmas (1998), and Ed Asner in Elf (2003).  Later films about Santa vary, but can be divided into the following themes. The Year Without a Santa Claus is a 90-minute 2006 live-action remake of the Rankin-Bass classic The Year Without a Santa Claus which premiered on NBC December 11, 2006.

Truth Initiative (formerly the American Legacy Foundation or Legacy) is a nonprofit tobacco control organization dedicated to achieving a culture where all youth and young adults reject tobacco.  It was established in March 1999 as a result of the Master Settlement Agreement between the attorneys general of 46 states, the District of Columbia and five United States territories, and the tobacco industry.  Truth Initiative is best known for its youth smoking prevention campaign.  Its other primary aims include conducting tobacco control research and policy studies, organizing community and youth engagement programs and developing digital cessation and prevention products, including through revenue-generating models.  The organization changed its name from the American Legacy Foundation to Truth Initiative on September 8, 2015, to better align with its Truth campaign.  As of 2016, the organization had more than $957 million in assets and a staff of 133 based primarily in its Washington, D.C. office. Extrema formed in 1986 in Milan.  The initial lineup included guitarist Tommy Massara, vocalist/guitarist Andrea Boria, bassist Luca Varisco, and drummer Stefano Bullegas.  Regarded as one of Italy's first thrash metal bands, Extrema's first EP, We F**kin' Care (1987), sold an impressive 3,000 copies by word of mouth alone.  Italian heavy metal fans didn't yet seem prepared to embrace local talent, however, and the next four years saw Extrema (by then entirely re-vamped, with Massara signing on new members Gianluca Perotti on vocals, Mattia Bigi on bass, and Chris Dalla Pellegrina on drums) relegated to open for visiting acts like Slayer, D.R.I., and Corrosion of Conformity.  Finally realizing that their only hope of impressing local talent scouts lay in conquering from the outside-in, Extrema started aggressively shopping their demos to international heavy metal critics, and even financed a trip to New York City for a one-off gig.  The strategy worked, and their four-track demo from 1991 was soon making waves with some major international publications, eventually leading to a record deal with Contempo Records.  The result was the 1993's Tension at the Seams album, which led to stadium support slots with Italian rock star Vasco Rossi, and more importantly a high-profile metal festival appearance in Turin alongside Megadeth, The Cult, Suicidal Tendencies, and Metallica.  The album also featured an unconventional cover of The Police's Truth Hits Everybody and spawned a video clip for the track Child O' Boogaow which was on heavy rotation on Italy's MTV affiliate, Videomusic. Truth (stylized as truth) is a national campaign aimed at curbing youth smoking in the United States.  The truth campaign is produced and funded by the American Legacy Foundation, a public health nonprofit organization established in 1999 under the Master Settlement Agreement between U.S. tobacco companies, 46 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and five territories.  truth produces television and online content to promote anti-tobacco messages.

The memorial is located about 5 km from the city centre across the Tiger Hill.  It is located on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway 1D.  The memorial is in the memory of the soldiers and officers of the Indian Army who were killed during the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan.  The conflict later became known as the Kargil War.  The memorial has a huge epitaph with names of all the officers and soldiers who died in war.  Kargil Vijay Diwas is celebrated on 26 July every year at the memorial simultaneously the Prime Minister of India pays tribute to the soldiers at Amar Jawan Jyothi at the India Gate, New Delhi. The main attraction of the whole memorial is the Sandstone wall, in the open, which has the names of all the Indian army personnel, who laid their lives during the Kargil war besides there is also a souvenir shop.  Visitors to the memorial can also see from there, some of the peaks that the Indian army captured back from Pakistan.  A giant national flag, weighing 15 kg was hoisted at the Kargil war memorial to commemorate the 13th anniversary of India’s victory in the war The Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and situated on the cathedral green in Exeter, the county town of Devon, in the south west of England.  It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city.  The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds.  After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead.  The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.  A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials—the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens. Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England.  Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities—the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922.  The committee quickly raised £10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial.  The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community.  The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.  Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ. The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England.  Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial.  Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose.  Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument.  The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds. The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire.  The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1884 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880.  It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion. The Reading Post (until 2009, the Reading Evening Post), was an English local newspaper covering Reading, Berkshire and surrounding areas.  The title page of the paper featured the Maiwand Lion, a famous local landmark at Forbury Gardens.  The paper was most recently published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd., a division of Trinity Mirror plc. Spalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England.  It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.  The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war.  She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross.  The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council.  When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.  After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building. The Forbury Hotel (formerly Shire Hall) is a grade II listed hotel in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.  It is situated on the southern side of Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town centre.

It is located adjacent to the remaining ruins of Reading Abbey, between the Forbury Gardens and Reading Gaol. Forbury Gardens is a public park in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.  The park is on the site of the outer court of Reading Abbey, which was in front of the Abbey Church.

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the title of Lord of Islay was held by the chiefs of Clann Domhnaill before they adopted the title Lord of the Isles. The first person known to have styled themselves Lord of Islay was Aonghus Mór, son of the eponymous ancestor of the clan, Domhnall mac Raghnaill. The designation of Islay was frequently used by these lords and later members of the clan. Aonghus Mór mac Domhnaill (died c.1293) was a prominent figure in the 13th-century kingdoms of the Isles and Scotland. He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle. Aonghus Mór appears to have succeeded his father in the mid-13th century. At the time, the rulers of the Isles were largely independent of the Scottish Crown, although they owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown. Aonghus Mór's first certain appearance in the historical record suggests his involvement in assisting native Irish kindreds against the consolidation of Anglo-Irish authority in the northwest of Ireland. This cooperation may have been undertaken as part of larger Irish alliances aimed at countering Scottish encroachment.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.  Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.  In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as Beatlemania, and as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. Marsha Albert (born 1948) is credited with being the person who jump-started the early 1960s phenomena known as Beatlemania in the United States when as a 15-year-old girl, on 17 December 1963, she introduced for the first time on American radio a song written and recorded by The Beatles titled I Want to Hold Your Hand (the Beatles' best-selling single worldwide), and that Beatles historian and author Bruce Spizer noted, in 2004, by his stating Marsha Albert's actions forced a major record company to push up the release date of a debut single from an unknown band during the holiday season, a time when record companies traditionally released no new product. Cargo Records was a Canadian independent record label and distributor, active in the 1980s and 1990s.

Azra was a rock band that was popular across Yugoslavia in the 1980s.  Azra was formed in 1977 by its frontman Branimir Johnny Štulić.  The other two members of the original line-up were Mišo Hrnjak (bass) and Boris Leiner (drums).  The band is named after a verse from Der Asra by Heinrich Heine.  They are considered to be one of the most influential bands from the former Yugoslav new wave rock era and the Yugoslav rock scene in general. The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961.  The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine.  Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era.  The group, led by their principal songwriter and producer Brian, pioneered novel approaches to popular music form and production, combining their affinities for jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound.  He later arranged his compositions for studio orchestras and explored a variety of other styles, often incorporating classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. Christian Death is an American deathrock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1979 by Rozz Williams.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.  In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as Beatlemania, but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. Adam and the Ants were an English rock band active during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  The group, which lasted from 1977 to 1982, existed in two incarnations, both fronted by Adam Ant.  The first, founded in May 1977 and known simply as The Ants until November that year, achieved considerable cult popularity during the transition from the punk rock era to the post-punk and new wave era and were noted for their high camp and overtly sexualised stage performances and songs.  The final line-up of this first incarnation – Dave Barbarossa, Matthew Ashman and Leigh Gorman – left the band in January 1980 at the suggestion of then-de facto manager Malcolm McLaren, to form the instrumentalist personnel of the controversial Bow Wow Wow. David Bruce Spizer (born July 2, 1955) is a tax attorney in New Orleans, Louisiana, who is also recognized as an expert on The Beatles.  He has published eight books, and is frequently quoted as an authority on the history of the band and its recordings. Elvis Presley has inspired artistic and cultural works since he entered the national consciousness.  From that point, interest in his personal and public life has never stopped.  Some scholars have even studied many aspects of his profound cultural influence.  Billboard historian Joel Whitburn declared Presley the #1 act of the Rock era. [/INST]

response:    Here is a paraphrased version of the passage:

The Beatles were a legendary English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the most influential act of the rock era. In the early 1960s, their massive popularity emerged as Beatlemania, but as their music evolved, they were seen as a symbol of the counterculture of the 1960s. Other notable bands from the era include Azra, a Yugoslav rock band formed in 1977 by frontman Branimir Johnny Štulić, and The Beach Boys, an American rock band formed in California in 1961. Christian Death, an American deathrock band formed in Los Angeles in 1979 by Rozz Williams, also gained recognition for their unique sound. Adam and the Ants were an English rock band active from 1977 to 1982, fronted by Adam Ant in two incarnations. The band was known for their flamboyant stage performances and sexually charged songs. David Bruce Spizer, a tax attorney and Beatles expert, has published eight books on the band's history and recordings. Elvis Presley, known as the "King of Rock and Roll," has had a lasting impact on popular culture, inspiring countless artistic and cultural works since his rise to fame in the 1950s.

Its output is 6 to 10 candela, brighter than that of earlier lamps.  Its more complete combustion of the candle wick and oil than in other lamps required much less frequent trimming of the wick. A hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is type of cold cathode lamp used in physics and chemistry as a spectral line source (e.g. for atomic absorption spectrometers) and as a frequency tuner for light sources such as lasers.  An HCL takes advantage of the hollow cathode effect, which causes conduction at a lower voltage and with more current than a cold cathode lamp that does not have a hollow cathode. Antoine Quinquet was a French pharmacist who was born in Soissons on 9 March 1745.  In 1760 he was apprenticed to an apothecary in Soissons and in 1777 he moved to Paris where he worked for Antoine Baumé.  He travelled to Geneva, where he met Aimé Argand.  In 1779, he returned to Paris and opened his own pharmacy there. A kerosene lamp (usually called a paraffin lamp in some countries) is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene (paraffin) as a fuel.  Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting.  Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats.  There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat wick, central draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp.  Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast variants. A glow switch starter is a type of preheat starter used with fluorescent lamp.  It is commonly filled with neon gas or argon gas and contains a bimetallic strip and a stationary electrode.  The operating principle is simple, when current is applied, the gas inside ionizes and heats a bimetallic strip which in turn bends toward the stationary electrode thus shorting the starter between the electrodes of the fluorescent lamp After a second the starter's bimetallic strip will cool and open the circuit between the electrodes and the process repeats until the lamp has lit.  One disadvantage of glow switch starters is that when the lamp is at the end of its life it will continuously blink on and off until the glow switch starter wears out or an electrode on the fluorescent lamp burns out. The qulliq (seal-oil, blubber or soapstone lamp, Inuktitut: ᖁᓪᓕᖅ , ‘kudlik’ ] ; Inupiaq: naniq ), is the traditional oil lamp used by Arctic peoples, including the Inuit, the Chukchi and the Yupik peoples. A trouble light, also known as a rough service light, drop light, or inspection lamp, is a special lamp used to illuminate obscure places and able to handle moderate abuse.  The light bulb is housed in a protective cage and a handle that are molded to form a single unit.  It has a long power line for distant reaching; the handle may also have electrical outlet on it, allowing the light to also double as an extension cord. The Lewis lamp is a type of light fixture used in lighthouses.  It was invented by Winslow Lewis who patented the design in 1810.  The primary marketing point of the Lewis lamp was that it used less than half the oil of the prior oil lamps which they replaced.  The lamp used a similar design to an Argand lamp, adding a parabolic reflector behind the lamp and a magnifying lens made from 4 in green bottle glass in front of the lamp.  A similar variant using a parabolic reflector was created by the inventor of the Argand lamp, Aimé Argand.  While the Argand variant became widely used by European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp design was selected by the United States for use in American lighthouses. The Hefner lamp, or in German Hefnerkerze, is a flame lamp used in photometry that burns amyl acetate. The carbon button lamp is a single-electrode incandescent lamp invented by Nikola Tesla.  A carbon button lamp contains a small carbon sphere positioned in the center of an evacuated glass bulb.  This type of lamp must be driven by high-frequency alternating current, and depends on an electric arc or perhaps a vacuum arc to produce high current around the carbon electrode.  The carbon electrode is then heated to incandescence by collisions by ions which constitute the electric current.  Tesla found that these lamps could be used as powerful sources of ionizing radiation. [/INST]

The genus is abbreviated Bro in trade journals. William Henry Nicholls (23 July 1885 – 10 March 1951) was an Australian amateur botanist, authority on, and collector of Australian orchids.  An accomplished photographer and watercolourist, he contributed almost 100 articles on orchids to The Victorian Naturalist, many of which described new species with line drawings.  He was working on producing a 24-volume illustrated monograph of all the orchids of Australia when he died.  Only four volumes were published shortly after his death but the entire work was published in a single book, Orchids of Australia in 1969.  Some of the many orchids described and named by Nicholls and retaining the name he gave them include Caladenia caudata, Caladenia echidnachila, Caladenia ensata, Caladenia ferruginea, Caladenia magniclavata, Caladenia ornata, Caladenia praecox, Caladenia radiata, Pterostylis fischii, Pterostylis hamiltonii, Pterostylis hildii and Pterostylis tenuissima. Otaara, abbreviated Otr.  in the horticultural trade, is an intergeneric hybrid of orchids, with Brassavola, Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia and Sophronitis as parent genera. Paracaleana commonly known as duck orchids, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae that is found in Australia and New Zealand.  The Australian species are found in all states but have not been recorded in the Northern Territory.  Orchids in this genus are similar to Caleana major, but there are differences in the flowers and in the insects that pollinate them.  Paraceleana orchids, as well as hammer orchids (Drakaea) are pollinated by male thynnid wasps.  Duck orchids have a single leaf and one or a few, dull-coloured, inconspicuous flowers. Laeliocattleya is a nothogenus of intergeneric orchid hybrids descended from the parental genera Laelia and Cattleya.  It is abbreviated Lc.  in the horticultural trade. Caladenia, commonly known as spider orchids, is a genus of 350 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Spider orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single hairy leaf and a hairy stem.  The labellum is fringed or toothed in most species and there are small projections called calli on the labellum.  The flowers have adaptations to attract particular species of insects for pollination.  The genus is divided into three groups on the basis of flower shape, broadly, spider orchids, zebra orchids and cowslip orchids, although other common names are often used.  Although they occur in other countries, most are Australian and 136 species occur in Western Australia, making it the most species-rich orchid genus in that state. Broughtonia is a genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae) native to the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles.  The genus is abbreviated Bro in trade journals. Calochilus, commonly known as beard orchids, is a genus of about 30 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Beard orchids are terrestrial, herbs with a single leaf at the base of the plant, or no leaves.  Their most striking feature is a densely hairy labellum, giving rise to their common name.  Beard orchids, unlike some other Australian orchids, do not reproduce using daughter tubers, but self-pollinate when cross-pollination has not occurred.  Most species occur in Australia but some are found in New Zealand, New Guinea and New Caledonia. Cattleytonia (from Cattleya and Broughtonia, its parental genera) is an intergeneric hybrid of orchids.  It is abbreviated Ctna in horticultural trade. Hawkinsara, abbreviated Hknsa.  in the horticultural trade, is an intergeneric hybrid of orchids, with parent genera Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia and Sophronitis. [/INST]

Order of battle compiled from the army organization during the battle, the casualty returns and the reports.  The Union order of battle is listed separately. The Battle of Manila (February 3, 1945 – March 3, 1945) was a major battle of the Philippine campaign of 1944-45, during the Second World War.  It was fought by American and Filipino forces against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.  The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of over 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting in the Pacific theater.  Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle.  Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's foundation.  The battle ended the almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines (1942–1945).  The city's capture was marked as General Douglas MacArthur's key to victory in the campaign of reconquest. The following Union Army units and commanders fought in the Seven Days Battles (from June 25 to July 1, 1862) of the American Civil War.  Order of battle compiled from the army organization-return of casualties during the battle and the reports.  The Confederate order of battle is listed separately. The Battle of Cross Keys was fought on June 8, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, as part of Confederate Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.  Together, the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic the following day were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia. The Battle of Gaines's Mill, sometimes known as the First Battle of Cold Harbor or the Battle of Chickahominy River, took place on June 27, 1862, in Hanover County, Virginia, as the third of the Seven Days Battles (Peninsula Campaign) of the American Civil War.  Following the inconclusive Battle of Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville) the previous day, Confederate General Robert E. Lee renewed his attacks against the right flank of the Union Army, relatively isolated on the northern side of the Chickahominy River.  There, Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps had established a strong defensive line behind Boatswain's Swamp.  Lee's force was destined to launch the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions.  Porter's reinforced V Corps held fast for the afternoon as the Confederates attacked in a disjointed manner, first with the division of Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill, then Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, suffering heavy casualties.  The arrival of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's command was delayed, preventing the full concentration of Confederate force before Porter received some reinforcements from the VI Corps. Savage's Station was the wartime name of a supply depot, ammunition dump, field hospital, and command headquarters of the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War.  Savage's Station was located in Henrico County, Virginia on what was the Richmond and York River Railroad, however the historical department of the Norfolk Southern Railroad, the railroad track's current owner, has no record that an actual train station or station house ever existed on the property.  A farmhouse is known to have been located in a copse of trees on a small knoll next to the railroad track and is visible in several period drawings and photographs made during the war.  The house served as the nucleus of a large field hospital during and after the battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles.  The house also functioned as General George B. McClellan's headquarters during the battle of Savage's Station on June 29, 1862.  Although the house survived the battle in 1862, it was burned by Federal cavalry under General Philip H. Sheridan in 1864.  The house appears to have never been rebuilt, and no trace of it remains today.  However, a smokehouse from the 19th century still existed on the property as late as the 1930s when it was photographed during a survey of local historical structures as a project of the Civilian Conservation Corps.  The smokehouse fell into ruin and collapsed sometime prior to the 1980s.  A small brick-walled cemetery from the 18th century still sits near the former location of the house not far from the railroad track. The Battle of Port Republic was fought on June 9, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, as part of Confederate Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.  Port Republic was a fierce contest between two equally determined foes and was the most costly battle fought by Jackson's Army of the Valley during its campaign.  Together, the battles of Cross Keys (fought the previous day) and Port Republic were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia. The Seven Days Battles were a series of six major battles over the seven days from June 25 to July 1, 1862, near Richmond, Virginia, during the American Civil War.  Confederate General Robert E. Lee drove the invading Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula.  The series of battles is sometimes known erroneously as the Seven Days Campaign, but it was actually the culmination of the Peninsula Campaign, not a separate campaign in its own right. The Northern Virginia Campaign, also known as the Second Bull Run Campaign or Second Manassas Campaign, was a series of battles fought in Virginia during August and September 1862 in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War.  Confederate General Robert E. Lee followed up his successes of the Seven Days Battles in the Peninsula Campaign by moving north toward Washington, D.C., and defeating Maj. Gen. John Pope and his Army of Virginia. The Battle of Malvern Hill, also known as the Battle of Poindexter's Farm, was fought on July 1, 1862 between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by Gen. Robert E. Lee, and the Union Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan.  It was the final battle of the Seven Days Battles during the American Civil War, taking place on a 130 ft elevation of land known as Malvern Hill, near the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia and just one mile (1.6 km) from the James River.  Including inactive reserves, more than fifty thousand soldiers from each side took part, using more than two hundred pieces of artillery and three warships. [/INST]

During the American Civil War, several Confederate Army units and commanders fought in the Seven Days Battles, which took place from June 25 to July 1, 1862, near Richmond, Virginia. These battles were part of Confederate General Robert E. Lee's campaign to drive the Union Army of the Potomac, led by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, away from Richmond. The Confederate order of battle included units such as Stonewall Jackson's Army of the Valley, which fought in the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic on June 8 and 9, respectively. These victories were crucial in forcing the Union armies to retreat and allowing Lee to reinforce his forces for the Seven Days Battles. The Union Army units and commanders involved in the Seven Days Battles included V Corps, VI Corps, and the Army of the Potomac. The battles of the Seven Days were a decisive series of engagements that marked a turning point in the war, as the Confederate Army was able to repel the Union invasion of Virginia and protect the capital of Richmond.

Maxine's Tap Room is a historic bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas, located on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building—a long, narrow brick structure—built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.  Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs. [/INST]

The song "I Love to Laugh" from the movie Mary Poppins is a memorable tune that highlights the joy and happiness that laughter brings. The scene in which Uncle Albert and Bert levitate into the air due to their infectious laughter is a classic moment in the film. The song states that laughter has the power to lighten any mood and bring people together. In contrast, the song "Step in Time" is a lively and upbeat number from the same film, showcasing the chimney sweeps' energetic dance moves as they work on the rooftops of London. Meanwhile, "My Kind of Town" is a song from the musical Robin and the 7 Hoods, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost to "Chim Chim Cher-ee" from Mary Poppins. "A Man Has Dreams" is a slow and operatic duet between Bert and George Banks, discussing the importance of having dreams and never giving up on them. Mary Poppins Opens the Door is a novel in the Mary Poppins series by P.L. Travers, which was published in 1943 and features the magical nanny's return to the Banks family after a family tragedy. The upcoming sequel to the 1964 film, Mary Poppins Returns, will feature Emily Blunt as Mary Poppins and Lin-Manuel Miranda as her companion, Bert. Chim Chim Cher-ee is a memorable song from the Mary Poppins film, featuring Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, and can be heard in various Disney attractions and productions.

In country music, walkdown is a bassline which connects two root position chords whose roots are a third apart, often featuring an inverted chord to go between the root notes of the first two chords.  See: slash chord.  A walkup would be the converse.  For example the chords G Major and E minor (a minor third apart) may be joined by an intervening chord to create stepwise motion in the bass: G-D/F♯ -Em (I-V6/4-vi).  The second chord, D Major, is performed with its third note, the F#, in the bass.  Walkdowns may be performed by the upright bass player, the electric bass player, the guitarist, or a piano player.

The remains, NMMNH P-18400, consist of a tibia, vertebrae, and fragments, and came from the ? late Carnian-age Upper Triassic Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation, near Fort Wingate.  Andrew Heckert, in his unpublished thesis, proposed the name Cinizasaurus hunti for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauriformes. Sphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada.  To date, three species have been described: the type species, S. goodwini, from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; S. buchholtzae, from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and S. edmontonense, from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.  The etymology of Sphaerotholus is a combination of the Greek sphaira, meaning ball, and tholos, meaning dome, and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull.  The survival of Sphaerotholus from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8 million years) and a widespread distribution.  Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.  Sphaerotholus is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur. Oryctodromeus (meaning digging runner) was a genus of small ornithopod dinosaur.  Fossils are known from the middle Cretaceous Blackleaf Formation of southwestern Montana and the Wayan Formation of southeastern Idaho, USA, both of the Cenomanian stage, roughly 95 million years ago.  A member of the small, presumably fast-running herbivorous family Thescelosauridae, Oryctodromeus is the first dinosaur published that shows evidence of burrowing behavior. Cryptoraptor (meaning secret thief) is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a dinosaur.  The remains, NMMNH P-17375, consist of a fragmentary skeleton including vertebrae, a pubis, and parts of the thigh bones.  This specimen came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation in Quay County.  Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name Cryptoraptor lockleyi for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauria. Comanchesaurus is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a theropod dinosaur.  The remains, NMMNH P-4569, consist of a partial skeleton including vertebral centra and hindlimb bones, and came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation of Guadalupe County.  Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name Comanchesaurus kuesi for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors found the material to belong to a possible indeterminate saurischian. McFarland, USA (also known as McFarland) is a 2015 American sports drama film directed by Niki Caro, produced by Mark Ciardi and Gordon Gray, written by Christopher Cleveland, Bettina Gilois and Grant Thompson with music composed by Antônio Pinto.

It is the 39th Disney animated feature film and Disney's The Secret Lab computer animated feature, though it is not officially labeled as one of the animated classics in the United Kingdom, where The Wild (2006) is included in the canon instead. Fruitadens is a genus of heterodontosaurid dinosaur.  The name means Fruita tooth, in reference to Fruita, Colorado (USA), where its fossils were first found.  It is known from partial skulls and skeletons from at least four individuals of differing biological ages, found in Tithonian (Late Jurassic) rocks of the Morrison Formation in Colorado.  Fruitadens is the smallest known ornithischian dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to in length and 0.5 to in weight.  It is interpreted as an omnivore and represents one of the latest-surviving heterodontosaurids. Dakotadon is a genus of iguanodont dinosaur from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota, USA, known from a partial skull.  It was first described in 1989 as Iguanodon lakotaensis, by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork.  Its assignment has been controversial.  Some researchers suggest that I. lakotaensis was more basal than I. bernissartensis, and related to Theiophytalia, but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of I. bernissartensis.  Gregory S. Paul, working on a revision of iguanodont species, gave I. lakotaensis its own genus (Dakotadon) in 2008. [/INST]

Johnson, who had successfully associated himself with Kennedy’s popularity, won 61.1% of the popular vote, the highest win by a candidate since James Monroe’s re-election in 1820.  It was the most lopsided US presidential election in terms of popular votes, and the tenth-most lopsided presidential election in the history of the United States in terms of electoral votes.  No candidate for president since has equalled or surpassed Johnson’s percentage of the popular vote, and since 1820, only Abraham Lincoln in 1864, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 have won by a greater electoral vote margin. The United States presidential election of 1892 was the 27th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 1892.  It witnessed a re-match of the closely contested presidential election in 1888.  Former Democratic President Grover Cleveland and incumbent Republican President Benjamin Harrison both ran for election to a second term.  In 1888, Cleveland won the popular vote over Harrison, but lost in the electoral college.  In a re-match, Cleveland won both the popular and electoral vote, thus becoming the first and to date only person in American history to be elected to a second, non-consecutive presidential term.  The new Populist Party, formed by groups from The Grange, the Farmers' Alliances, and the Knights of Labor, also fielded a ticket; they polled best in the West, winning in five states and taking a total of 22 electoral votes.

response:    The United States has held 58 presidential elections since 1789, with the next election scheduled for November 8, 2020. These elections have seen a variety of candidates and outcomes, with some elections resulting in the re-election of incumbent presidents, while others have seen new leaders take office.

In 1976, Jimmy Carter, a former governor of Georgia, won the election as a dark horse candidate, defeating incumbent President Gerald Ford. This was the first presidential election in which residents of Alaska and Hawaii were able to participate, as both states had become states in 1959.

In 2016, businessman Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence defeated the Democratic ticket of former First Lady Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, with Trump taking office as the 45th President and Pence as the 48th Vice President. This election was notable for the surprise victory of the Republican ticket and the divisive political climate that characterized the campaign.

Other significant presidential elections include the 1968 election, in which former Vice President Richard Nixon won over incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey; the 1960 election, in which John F. Kennedy defeated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon; and the 1944 election, in which incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt won an unprecedented fourth term in office.

The 1892 election saw a re-match of the closely contested 1888 election, with former Democratic President Grover Cleveland winning both the popular and electoral vote. This election also saw the formation of the Populist Party, which fielded a ticket of its own.

Overall, the United States presidential elections have been marked by a range of candidates and outcomes, with some elections resulting in the re-election of incumbent presidents and others seeing new leaders take office. These elections have also been shaped by a variety of political and social factors, including the emergence of new political parties and the evolution of the electoral process itself.

The culture of Roman-Britain emerged in the 1st century AD after the Roman conquest of Britain, which began in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius. This culture was a blend of Roman and indigenous Celtic influences, which survived the withdrawal of the Romans in the 5th century. During this period, Latin was used in writing, and the Brittonic language continued to be spoken. The history of Wales dates back to the arrival of humans in the region thousands of years ago, with evidence of Neanderthal and Homo sapiens habitation. The Romans campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 AD and gained control of the region by defeating the Ordovices in 79 AD. After the Romans departed, the region was inhabited by the Celtic Britons, and the language and culture continued to evolve. The Sussex chicken, a popular garden chicken breed, originated in England around the time of the Roman conquest. The Catuvellauni tribe was one of the Celtic tribes inhabiting Britain before the Roman conquest, and their territory included modern-day southeastern England. England has a long history of human habitation, with evidence of early modern humans dating back to over 800,000 years ago. The region was continuously inhabited from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age, and the Britons spoke a Celtic language during the Iron Age. The Roman conquest of Britain began in AD 43, and the Romans maintained control of their province of Britannia until the early 5th century.

response:    Sure, here's a rewritten version of the passage with similar sentence structure and wording:

A multi-sport athlete is an individual who excels in two or more sports at a high level. Many athletes start playing multiple sports from a young age, including in high school, before deciding to concentrate on just one. Randall Wade Cunningham, a former NFL quarterback, played multiple sports in high school, including basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. He was a three-year starter on the soccer team and had his greatest success in that sport, winning the Group IV state championship in his junior and senior seasons. He was also a Parade All-American and New Jersey State Player of the Year. Masur, a former Rutgers University soccer player, was drafted by the New York Cosmos out of high school but elected to attend college instead. He was a four-year starter on the Rutgers men's soccer team and was the team's MVP in 1982 and 1983. He is the only Scarlet Knight to win back-to-back All-American honors. Guo Jie, a Chinese Olympic athlete, was a multi-sport athlete in high school and was inspired to compete at the Olympics after hearing about another athlete's participation. He became the national discus throw champion at the 1935 Chinese National Games and set a new national record shortly before his journey to Berlin. Kenny Frank Rose, a former NFL linebacker, graduated from Christian Brothers High School in Sacramento and attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he played alongside Randall Cunningham. Rose dreamed of playing in the NFL and attended several training camps in the mid-1980s but was rejected each time. He received an opportunity with the New York Jets in 1987 during the players' strike and became one of the few scabs to stay on the roster when the regular players returned to work. Adam Thielen, an NFL wide receiver, was a multi-sport athlete in high school and played college football at Minnesota State University. Vashti Cunningham, the daughter of retired NFL quarterback Randall Cunningham, is a track and field athlete who specializes in the high jump. She jumped for Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas until March 2016 when she signed with Nike and announced she would continue her education at a university while competing as a professional athlete.

Old and New is a compilation album by English musician Phil Collins.  The album was released by Atlantic Recording Corporation and Rhino Entertainment on 28 September 2004.  The album was released only a few months after the box set The Platinum Collection, which appeared earlier in the year (see 2004 in music). Sharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter.  Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy.  Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included.  Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures.  This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it.  If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views.  When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others.  You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances.  According to Gannon: How you treat others will determine how others treat you.  How others treat you will determine how you see yourself.  How you see yourself will determine who you are. See Yourself is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3.  Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love. English musician Syd Barrett recorded many songs during his short career as a musician.  One of the founding members of English rock band Pink Floyd, he was the dominant force of the band in their early years, writing most of the material found on their first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, contributing to their second one, A Saucerful of Secrets, and recording several unreleased songs with the band.  Due to increasing mental illness, Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 and was subsequently replaced by guitarist David Gilmour.  After Pink Floyd, Barrett would record two solo albums, both released in 1970, before Barrett left the music business entirely in 1972. No Plan is an extended play, comprising songs written and recorded by English musician David Bowie, released posthumously on 8 January 2017.  The release coincided with what would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, almost a year after his death.  No Plan compiles the original songs written for Bowie's Broadway musical, Lazarus, including the titular Lazarus, No Plan, Killing a Little Time, and When I Met You.  The songs were first recorded by the cast of the musical as part of its official soundtrack.  The recordings featured on No Plan come from the sessions for Bowie's twenty-fifth and final studio album Blackstar, with Lazarus appearing as the third track on the album.  Upon release, No Plan debuted at #138 on the Billboard 200.  The music video for the title track was also released in accompaniment with the EP.  It was directed by Tom Hingston. We Laughed is a three-track single by English musician Billy Bragg as part of the Rosetta Life project.  The single was released in 2005 in the UK and peaked at No. 11.  It also reached No. 38 in Ireland in 2006.  For the three songs on the single, Bragg collaborated with three patients of Trimar Hospice in Weymouth, who each wrote lyrics based on their illness and feelings.  The songs were produced by English guitarist Robbie McIntosh. Who Can See It is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1973 album Living in the Material World.  The lyrics reflect Harrison's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles' legacy, three years after the group's break-up, and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band's unprecedented popularity.  Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish, following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass and his 1971–72 Bangladesh aid project.  The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between Living in the Material World and John Lennon's primal therapy-inspired 1970 release, Plastic Ono Band. 5:55 is the second album by French musician and actress Charlotte Gainsbourg.  It is also her first album release in twenty years.  Charlotte collaborated on the album with French duo Air, English musician Jarvis Cocker, and Irish singer-songwriter Neil Hannon, as well as Radiohead's main producer Nigel Godrich.  The Songs That We Sing and 5:55 were released as singles.  The album went platinum in France, selling over 500,000 copies.  In the United States, the album sold a modest 22,000 copies.  The Songs That We Sing was #78 on Rolling Stone' s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. Colin Murray Gem Archer (born 7 December 1966) is an English musician, best known as a member of the English rock bands Oasis, Beady Eye and Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.  He is also known for his work with Heavy Stereo.  He joined Oasis as rhythm guitarist in November 1999, and handled lead guitar for acoustic songs as well.  He also contributed to the writing of some of the band's songs.  Oasis broke up in August 2009, but in November 2009, Liam Gallagher announced he was writing new material with Archer as well as other ex-Oasis members minus his brother Noel, under the name Beady Eye.  After two albums with Beady Eye, 2011's Different Gear, Still Speeding and 2013's BE, the band officially disbanded in October 2014.  In 2017, Archer joined Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds as lead guitarist, thus reuniting with former Oasis member Noel Gallagher. Within You Without You is a song written by George Harrison and released on the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after Love You To, and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September–October 1966.  Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle.  The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.  Although the song was his only composition on Sgt. Pepper, Harrison's endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover. [/INST]

Born in Los Angeles, Grinnage made his first television appearances in 1954.  The following year, he played as Moose – one of three teenage rebels who chase James Dean – in Rebel Without a Cause (1955).  Rebel Without a Cause was his first movie where he received a screen credit. Rebel Without a Pause is a song by hip hop group Public Enemy and the first single from their 1988 album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.  The title is a reference to the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause. This is also the first song to sample Funky Drummer. CBS Television Workshop is an American anthology series which aired on CBS from January to April 1952.  The series is noted for featuring early television appearances of several well known actors including Audrey Hepburn, James Dean and Grace Kelly. James Gilmore Backus (February 25, 1913 – July 3, 1989) was an American radio, television, film, and voice actor.  Among his most famous roles were the voice of nearsighted cartoon character Mr. Magoo, the rich Hubert Updike III on the radio version of The Alan Young Show, Joan Davis' character's husband (a domestic court judge) on TV's I Married Joan, James Dean's character's father in Rebel Without a Cause, and Thurston Howell III, on the 1960s sitcom Gilligan's Island.  He also starred in his own show of one season, The Jim Backus Show, also known as Hot Off the Wire. Rebel Highway was a short-lived revival of American International Pictures created and produced by Lou Arkoff, the son of Samuel Z. Arkoff and Debra Hill for the Showtime channel in 1994.  The concept was 10-week series of 1950s drive-in classic B-movies remade with a '90s edge.  The impetus for the series, according to Arkoff was, what it would be like if you made Rebel Without a Cause today.  It would be more lurid, sexier, and much more dangerous, and you definitely would have had Natalie Wood's top off.  Originally, Arkoff wanted to call the series, Raging Hormones but Showtime decided on Rebel Highway instead.  Arkoff and Hill invited several directors to pick a title from one of Samuel Arkoff's movies, hire their own writers and create a story that could resemble the original if they wanted.  In addition, they had the right to a final cut and select their own director of photography and the editor.  Each director was given a $1.3 million budget and 12 days to shoot it with a cast of young, up and coming actors and actresses.  According to Arkoff, the appeal to directors was that, They weren't hampered by big studios saying, 'You can't do this or that.'  And all the directors paid very close attention to the detail of the era.  We want these shows to be fun for the younger generation and fun for the older generation. Corey Allen (June 29, 1934 – June 27, 2010) was an American film and television director, writer, producer, and actor.  He began his career as an actor but eventually became a television director.

The trio consist of Casey and his older half-brothers Darryl (Steve Peacocke) and Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing).  The River Boys arrive in Summer Bay from neighbouring town Mangrove River.  Casey is characterised as being a modern day Rebel Without a Cause; who is intelligent and unsure about what he wants out of life.  Younes has described him as the epitome of teenage angst.  The River Boys cause trouble in Summer Bay and producers were inspired by Koby Abberton's Bra Boys in the creation process.  Casey is portrayed as wanting to distance himself from their bad reputation; but his anger issues often mar his attempts.

General elections were held in Sweden on September 19, 1982, which saw the return of the Social Democratic Party to power after six years in opposition, the longest period in opposition by the Social Democrats since the 1910s. The center-right coalition of Thorbjörn Fälldin had earlier suffered a loss when the rightist Moderate Party chose to withdraw from the government in 1981, protesting against the centrist tax policies of the Fälldin government. After regaining power, socialist leader Olof Palme succeeded in being elected Prime Minister again, having earlier held the position between 1969 and 1976. He would retain this position successfully until his assassination in 1986.

In Oman, Bal'arab bin Himyar was one of the rival Imams during the civil wars in the final years of the Yaruba dynasty. He was elected Imam in 1728, holding power in the interior of Oman while his cousin, Saif bin Sultan II, held power on the coast. In 1737, he renounced his claim after being defeated by Saif's Persian allies. He was again elected Imam in 1743 during another Persian invasion, and again held power in the interior while Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi was recognized as ruler by the coastal people. He died in battle against Ahmad bin Said in 1749. Ahmad became the undisputed ruler of the country.

The Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) is the largest confederation of labor unions in Mexico. For many years, it was one of the essential pillars of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled Mexico for over seventy years. However, the CTM began to lose influence within the PRI structure in the late 1980s, as technocrats increasingly held power within the party. Eventually, the union found itself forced to deal with a new party in power after the PRI lost the 2000 general election, an event that drastically reduced the CTM's influence in Mexican politics.

The United Bermuda Party (UBP) was a political party in Bermuda that represented itself as a centrist party in favor of a moderate social and fiscal agenda. It held power in Bermuda's House of Assembly continuously from 1968 to 1998, and officially ceased operations on June 30, 2011, after the majority of its members joined the One Bermuda Alliance.

Federal elections for the House of Representatives were held in Australia on December 2, 1972, and were won by the Australian Labor Party led by Gough Whitlam. Labor won 67 of the 125 seats contested and defeated the Liberal Party led by Prime Minister William McMahon and Coalition partner the Country Party led by Doug Anthony. The elections ended 23 years of successive Coalition governments, which had held power since 1949.

Albania, officially the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, was a socialist state that ruled Albania from 1946 to its fall in 1992. From 1946 to 1976, it was known as the People's Republic of Albania, and from 1944 to 1946 as the Democratic Government of Albania. Throughout this period, the country had a reputation for its Stalinist-style state administration dominated by Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania, and for policies stressing national unity and self-reliance. Travel and visa restrictions made Albania one of the most difficult countries to visit or to travel from. In 1967, it declared itself the world's first atheist state. It was the only Warsaw Pact member to formally withdraw from the alliance before 1990, an action occasioned by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. The first multi-party elections in Socialist Albania took place on March 31, 1991 – the communists gained a majority in an interim government, and the first parliamentary elections were held on March 22, 1992. The People's Socialist Republic was officially dissolved on November 28, 1998, upon the adoption of the new Constitution of Albania.

[/INST] Rephrase paragraph: After serving in World War II, Charles resumed his boxing career in the light heavyweight division.

The team competes at the NCAA Division I level in the FBS and is a member of the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12).  Known as the Ducks, the team was commonly called the Webfoots until the mid-1960s.  The first football team was fielded in 1894.  Oregon plays its home games at the 54,000 seat Autzen Stadium in Eugene; its main rivals are the Oregon State Beavers and the Washington Huskies.  The Ducks and Beavers historically end each regular season with the Civil War rivalry game in late November. The Civil War is the colloquial name for an American college football rivalry game played annually in Oregon, between the Ducks of the University of Oregon in Eugene and the Beavers of Oregon State University in Corvallis.  First played in 1894, it is the fifth most played college football rivalry game in NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision.  Both universities are members of the North Division of the Pac-12 Conference. The Textile Bowl is an American college football rivalry game played annually by the Clemson Tigers football team of Clemson University and the NC State Wolfpack football team of North Carolina State University.  The rivalry game has been known as the Textile Bowl since 1981.  The two universities are founding members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and both have competed in the ACC's Atlantic Division since the conference initiated divisional play.  The rivalry's name is derived from the fact that Clemson and North Carolina State have two of the largest university-level textile schools in the world, and from the textile industry's historic importance in the economic development of their respective states of South Carolina and North Carolina. The Rivalry is an American college football rivalry game played by the Lafayette Leopards football team of Lafayette College and the Lehigh Mountain Hawks football team of Lehigh University.  It is the most-played football rivalry in the nation and the longest uninterrupted annual rivalry series.  As of 2016, The Rivalry has been played 152 times since 1884 with only a single interruption in 1896.  The college's football teams met twice annually (except 1891, when they played three games, and 1896, when they did not play at all) until 1901.  The two institutions are located seventeen miles apart in the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania.  Though primarily alluding to football, The Rivalry pertains to a meeting between the two schools in all sports and other endeavors. The 1983 Oregon State vs. Oregon football game was a college football game played on November 19, 1983, at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon, the 87th playing of the annual Civil War rivalry game.  The game ended in a scoreless tie.  Since overtime was added to NCAA Division I games in 1996, this game is likely to be the last ever with that distinction. The LSU–Ole Miss football rivalry, renamed the Magnolia Bowl in 2008, is an American college football rivalry game played annually by the LSU Tigers football team of Louisiana State University (LSU) and the Ole Miss Rebels football team of the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss).  The teams compete for the Magnolia Bowl Trophy.  The Tigers and the Rebels first met in 1894, and have been regular opponents in Southeastern Conference (SEC), meeting annually since 1945.  The rivalry was at its height during the 1950s and 1960s, when both teams were highly ranked and during which time both teams claimed a national championship.  The rivalry died down from the 1970s to the 1990s, owing to Ole Miss not returning to conference or national prominence since the 1970s and because LSU has seen new rivalries emerge when the SEC split into two divisions in 1992, most notably Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, and Florida.  Even though the rivalry has not attracted the same national attention in recent years, it still stirs up passion in both Oxford and Baton Rouge. Joe Walker (born December 11, 1992) is an American football linebacker for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL).  He played college football at Oregon. The Battle of the Blue is an annual college football rivalry game between the University of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens and Villanova University Wildcats.  The first game was played between the two teams in 1895, was played annually from 1964 to 1980 when Villanova dropped football, and then resumed with the re-emergence of Villanova football having been played annually since 1988.  Beginning in 2007, the annual Delaware–Villanova game became known as Battle of the Blue.  As part of this concept, the winning team gets to keep the Battle of the Blue Trophy at its institution for the year and is responsible for bringing the trophy to the following installment of the rivalry game.  The trophy consists of a football with a Villanova logo and the Wildcat shade of blue on one side and the Blue Hen logo and the Delaware shade of blue on the other side.  The ball sits in a wooden platform and the scores of each game are engraved on the base of the trophy.  Villanova had possession of the trophy for the first four years, until Delaware won in 2011. The Army–Navy Game is an American college rivalry game in college football between the Army Black Knights of the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, and the Navy Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy (USNA) at Annapolis, Maryland.  The Black Knights (formerly the Army Cadets and Army Black Knights) and Midshipmen each represent their service's oldest officer commissioning sources.  As such, the game has come to embody the spirit of the interservice rivalry of the United States Armed Forces.  The game marks the end of the college football regular season and the third and final game of the season's Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series, which also includes the Air Force Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Battle for the Bell is an American college football rivalry game played by the Marshall Thundering Herd football team of Marshall University and the Ohio Bobcats football team of Ohio University.  It is a regional rivalry, with the universities' campuses located about 80 miles (130 km) from each other, with a bell awarded as the trophy for the winner of the game.  With Marshall's move from the Mid-American Conference to Conference USA in 2005, this rivalry game was on hiatus for several years.  The series unexpectedly resumed in 2009 when the Herd and Bobcats faced off in the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl, which Marshall won 21–17.  A six-year contract between the schools began in 2010.  Ohio leads the all-time series over Marshall 33–20–6. [/INST]

Pulmonary rehabilitation, also known as respiratory rehabilitation, is an important part of the management and health maintenance of people with chronic respiratory disease who remain symptomatic or continue to have decreased function despite standard medical treatment.  It is a broad therapeutic concept.  It is defined by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society as an evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive intervention for patients with chronic respiratory diseases who are symptomatic and often have decreased daily life activities.  In general, pulmonary rehabilitation refers to a series of services that are administered to patients of respiratory disease and their families, typically to attempt to improve the quality of life for the patient.  Pulmonary rehabilitation may be carried out in a variety of settings, depending on the patient's needs, and may or may not include pharmacologic intervention. The Journal of Thoracic Disease is a peer-reviewed open access medical journal covering pulmonology.  It was established in December 2009 and is published monthly by AME Publishing Company.  It is the official journal of the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, and the Society for Thoracic Disease.  The editor-in-chief is Zhong Nanshan (Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases).  According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 2.365. Yi Guan is a Chinese virologist who, in 2014, was ranked as 11th in the world by Thomson Reuters (now known as Clarivate Analytics) among global researchers in the field of microbiology.

He is the current Director (China affairs) of the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases University of Hong Kong.  In early 2017, Guan warned that the H7N9 influenza virus poses the greatest threat to humanity than any other in the past 100 years. The Irish Thoracic Society (ITS) is the official society for professionals involved in the care of people with chronic or acute respiratory disease in Ireland.  Membership of the Society is drawn from respiratory physicians, internal medicine physicians, pediatricians, thoracic surgeons, general practitioners, junior doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, dietitians, pulmonary function and respiratory therapists, scientists and other healthcare providers who specialize or have an interest in respiratory disease and care throughout Ireland - North and South. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).  Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China caused an eventual 8,098 cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in 37 countries, with the majority of cases in Hong Kong (9.6% fatality rate) according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004. Chronic Respiratory Disease is a quarterly peer-reviewed medical journal that covers research in the field of respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory failure, and obstructive sleep apnea.  The editors-in-chief are Mike Morgan (Glenfield Hospital), Carolyn Rochester (Yale University), and Sally Singh (Glenfield Hospital).  It was established in 2004 and is published by SAGE Publications. SARS is severe acute respiratory syndrome, a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus. Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is an upper respiratory or pulmonary infection of cats caused by feline herpesvirus 1, of the family Herpesviridae.  It is also commonly referred to as feline influenza, feline coryza, and feline pneumonia but, as these terms describe other very distinct collections of respiratory symptoms, they are misnomers for the condition.  Viral respiratory diseases in cats can be serious, especially in catteries and kennels. Causing one-half of the respiratory diseases in cats, FVR is the most important of these diseases and is found worldwide.  The other important cause of feline respiratory disease is feline calicivirus. Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma.  Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.  These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).  Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age.  HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development.  In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma.  Thus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma. [/INST]

Timeline of SARS Outbreak (2002-2004)

In 2002, a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak occurred in southern China, resulting in 8,098 cases and 774 deaths worldwide. The majority of cases were reported in Hong Kong, with a fatality rate of 9.6%. No cases of SARS have been reported since 2004.

Pulmonary Rehabilitation

Pulmonary rehabilitation is an important part of the management and health maintenance of people with chronic respiratory disease. It is a broad therapeutic concept that involves evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive interventions for patients with chronic respiratory diseases who are symptomatic and often have decreased daily life activities. Pulmonary rehabilitation may be carried out in various settings and may or may not include pharmacologic intervention.

Viral Respiratory Diseases in Cats

Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is an upper respiratory or pulmonary infection of cats caused by feline herpesvirus 1. It is the most important viral respiratory disease affecting cats, causing one-half of all respiratory diseases in cats and found worldwide.

Association between Viral Respiratory Infections and Asthma

Chronic mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma. These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production, and eventually asthma. Children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.

In conclusion, pulmonary rehabilitation plays a crucial role in managing chronic respiratory disease, while viral respiratory diseases in cats, such as FVR, can have serious consequences for their respiratory health. Additionally, acute exacerbations of asthma can be triggered by viral upper respiratory tract infections, such as human rhinovirus infections.

Facebook, Inc., et al. is a class action lawsuit filed in California against Facebook alleging misappropriation of Facebook users' names and likenesses in advertisements called Sponsored Stories.

Omar Ahmed Sayid Khadr (born September 19, 1986) is a Canadian citizen who was detained by the United States at Guantanamo Bay for ten years, from the age of 16, during which he pleaded guilty to the murder of U.S. Army Sergeant 1st Class Christopher Speer and other charges.

A liability insurance company's duty to settle is defined as an implied obligation to by the insurer to a policyholder and to a claimant to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.  To the surprise of many, a typical liability insurance policy makes no express contractual promise to settle.  In California, an insurer, who wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits.  A rationale for this duty is that [w]hen an offer is made to settle a claim in excess of policy limits for an amount within policy limits, a genuine and immediate conflict of interest arises between carrier and assured.  An insurer who denies coverage does so at its own risk.  Such factors as a belief that the policy does not provide coverage, should not affect a decision as to whether the settlement offer in question is a reasonable one.  It is the duty of the insurer to keep the insured informed of settlement offers.  [A]n insurer potentially can be liable for unreasonably coercing an insured to contribute to a settlement fund. Mana Al Otaiba (Arabic: مانع العتيبه‎ ‎ ) was born on 15 May 1946 to Saeed Al Otaiba in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.  Little else is known about Al Otaiba's personal life.

Damian Wayne or Damian al Ghul (Arabic: داميان الغول) is a fictional superhero and at times antihero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Batman.  He is the son of Batman and Talia al Ghul (Arabic: تاليا الغول), and thus, the grandson of Batman villain Ra's al Ghul.  The character originally appeared as an unnamed infant in the 1987 story , which at that time was not considered canon.  Following this, various alternate universe stories dealt with the character's life, giving him various names.  In 2006, the character was reinterpreted as Damian Wayne by Grant Morrison, and introduced into the main continuity in Batman #655, the first issue of the Batman and Son story arc.  Damian Wayne is the fifth character to assume the role of Robin, Batman's vigilante partner. The following is a list of the 20 largest settlements reached between the United States Department of Justice and pharmaceutical companies from 1991 to 2012, ordered by the size of the total settlement.  The settlement amount includes both the civil (False Claims Act) settlement and criminal fine.  Glaxo's $3 billion settlement included the largest civil, False Claims Act settlement on record, and Pfizer’s $2.3 billion settlement including a record-breaking $1.3 billion criminal fine.  Legal claims against the pharmaceutical industry have varied widely over the past two decades, including Medicare and Medicaid fraud, off-label promotion, and inadequate manufacturing practices.  With respect to off-label promotion, specifically, a federal court recognized off-label promotion as a violation of the False Claims Act for the first time in Franklin v.

In 2012, she recommended to her close friend Baptiste Giabiconi, to date Katy Perry. Tell El Sakan was an important ancient Egyptian maritime settlement during the early Bronze Age, situated at the mouth of wadi Ghazzeh.  Its geographical situation endowed it with a position of importance at the crossroads on the land based trade routes to Arabia, the Egyptian empire to the south and the Canaan region to the north.  The site (dated between 3500-2350 BCE) appears to be the predecessor to the Tell al-'Ajjul settlement, where geomorphological dynamics of the estuary caused settlement trans-location or abandonment.  The site dates from a period prior to the Egyptian military domination of the Levant.  The pottery finds at Tell es-Sakan along with Tell al-'Ajjul shows a strong ancient Egyptian link to the area, while the Bronze Age settlement at Taur Ikhbeineh has revealed a more localised pottery production with Egyptian-Canaanite interaction.

This is made possible through the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes, which are XY. The evolution of sex chromosomes in Silene occurred around 5-10 million years ago and has been studied extensively by geneticists and biologists. These plants are useful for understanding the mechanisms of sex determination, as they can produce offspring with a variety of reproductive systems. The sex of the offspring is determined by the Y chromosome. Silene species are found in a range of habitats, including tundra, mountains, and forested areas, and are known by common names such as campion, catchfly, and alpine campion."]}

{"question": "Over how many centuries were the \"dwelling place of the dead\" built?", "answer": ["three centuries"], "rewrite_passage": [" Here is a rewritten version of the passage, while maintaining the same meaning and semantics:\n\nIn the 1952 Technicolor Western film \"Flaming Feather,\" directed by Ray Enright and starring Sterling Hayden, the film was shot on location around Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, Arizona, and at the Montezuma Castle National Monument near Sedona. The local Yavapai Indians, who were hired as extras, refused to enter the cliff dwellings as they considered them the dwelling place of the dead. As a result, production was delayed until a group of Navajos were brought in from a reservation 137 miles away to replace them. Château de Druyes is a medieval castle located in Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, France, built in the 12th century by the Counts of Nevers. It was a noble residence and fortified castle, and was visited by Peter II of Courtenay, the Emperor of Constantinople, and his daughter Matilda, Countess of Nevers, Auxerre, and Tonnerre. Shamayim, the Hebrew word for heaven, refers to one of the three components of the cosmos, along with erets (the earth) and sheol (the underworld). Shamayim is the dwelling place of God and other heavenly beings, while erets is the home of the living, and sheol is the realm of the dead, including the abode of the righteous dead in post-Hebrew Bible literature. Montezuma Castle National Monument preserves a set of well-preserved dwellings built and used by the Sinagua people in Camp Verde, Arizona, between 1100 and 1425 AD. The main structure consists of five stories and 20 rooms, and was built over three centuries. In Norse mythology, Andlang is the second heavenly realm stretching between the first, containing the halls of the gods, and the third, named Vídbláinn. Andlang will serve as a shelter and dwelling place for the souls of the dead during and after Ragnarök. The Tabernacle, according to the Hebrew Bible, was the portable earthly dwelling place of God amongst the children of Israel, built with layers of curtains and furnished with valuable materials, and was later superseded by Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem. In zoology, an inquiline is an animal that lives commensally in the nest, burrow, or dwelling place of another species. Examples include insects that live in the homes of gophers, and feed on debris, fungi, roots, etc. The distinctions between parasites, social parasites, and inquilines are subtle, and many species may fulfill the criteria for more than one of these. However, parasites are specifically not inquilines, as they have a deleterious effect on the host species. Víðbláinn is the third heaven in Norse mythology, located above Andlang and Asgard, and will serve as a shelter and dwelling place for the souls of the dead during and after Ragnarök. The designation oldest synagogue in the United Kingdom requires careful definition, as many synagogues predate the expulsion of Jews from England but have been used for other purposes for many centuries. Similarly, the designation oldest synagogue in the world requires careful definition, as many very old synagogues have been discovered in archaeological digs, and some have been destroyed and rebuilt several times on the same site."]}

{"question": "Which component of shellite has the formula (ON)CHOH?", "answer": ["picric acid"], "rewrite_passage": ["Rephrased paragraph:\n\nIsopropyl alcohol, also known as dimethyl carbinol or incorrectly as isopropanol, is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CHO or CHOH or CHCHOHCH. It is a colorless, flammable liquid with a strong odor and is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms. Isopropyl alcohol has a wide range of industrial and household uses and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants, and detergents. Alcohol is a general term for any organic compound containing a hydroxyl functional group (-OH) bonded to a carbon atom. Simple acyclic alcohols, such as ethanol, are commonly found in alcoholic beverages, and the term alcohol often refers specifically to ethanol. Other important classes of alcohols include tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride, an organophosphorus compound used as a precursor to fire-retardant materials, and 1-hexanol, a colorless liquid with a slightly soluble water and miscible with diethyl ether and ethanol. Isomeric alcohols, such as 1-pentanol and xylitol, are also found in nature. Aldonic acids, which have the formula HOOC-(CHOH)-CHOH, are obtained by oxidation of the aldehyde functional group of an aldose, while uronic acids are obtained by oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group instead of the terminal aldehyde. Xylitol, a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener, has the formula CHOH(CHOH)CHOH and is categorized as a polyalcohol or sugar alcohol (alditol). In a mixture of a dielectric and a metallic component, the conductivity and dielectric constant show a critical behavior if the fraction of the metallic component reaches the percolation threshold. The behavior of the conductivity near this threshold can be described using two critical exponents, s and t, while the dielectric constant will diverge if the threshold is approached from either side."]}

The modern era of campaign finance reform began with the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) of 1971 and, more importantly, 1974 amendments to that Act. The 1971 FECA required candidates to disclose sources of campaign contributions and campaign expenditures. The 1974 Amendments essentially rewrote the Act from top to bottom, placing statutory limits on contributions by individuals for the first time, and creating the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as an independent enforcement agency. The 1974 Amendments also provided for broad new disclosure requirements and limited the amounts that candidates could spend on their campaigns, or that citizens could spend separate from candidate campaigns to promote their political views. However, the Act's provisions limiting expenditures were struck down as unconstitutional in the 1976 Supreme Court decision Buckley v. Valeo. (Source: U.S. Federal Election Commission)"]}

{"question": "This Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 ruled southeastern Britain prior to conquest by which empire?", "answer": ["Roman"], "rewrite_passage": [" Here is a rephrased version of the passage:\n\nThe culture of Roman-Britain emerged in the 1st century AD after the Roman Empire conquered Britain in 43 AD. This fusion of Roman and native Celtic cultures developed in the 5th and 6th centuries, despite the withdrawal of Roman legions in 410 AD. During this period, Latin was used in written forms of communication in southern Britain. The history of Wales can be traced back to the arrival of humans in the region thousands of years ago. The Neanderthals inhabited Wales at least 230,000 years ago, while modern humans arrived around 31,000 BC. Continuous habitation by modern humans began around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age. The Romans first campaigned in Wales in 48 AD against the Deceangli, and gained control of the region by defeating the Ordovices in 79 AD. The Romans departed Britain in the 5th century, allowing for the Anglo-Saxon invasion. This led to the splintering of Brittonic language and culture, with the Welsh people being the largest group to emerge. The Durotriges were one of the Celtic tribes living in Britain prior to the Roman invasion. They lived in modern Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset, and Devon east of the River Axe. After the Roman conquest, their main settlements were Durnovaria (modern Dorchester) and Lindinis (modern Ilchester). Their territory was bordered by the Dumnonii to the west and the Belgae to the east. The Corieltauvi were a tribe living in Britain prior to the Roman conquest, with their territory in the English East Midlands. They were bordered by the Brigantes to the north, the Cornovii to the west, the Dobunni and Catuvellauni to the south, and the Iceni to the east. Their capital was Ratae Corieltauvorum, known today as Leicester. Togodumnus, a historical king of the Catuvellauni tribe, can be identified with the legendary British king Guiderius. The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process that began in 43 AD under Emperor Claudius, with Aulus Plautius serving as the first governor of Roman Britain. Britain had frequently been the target of Roman invasions in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC. The Sussex chicken is a dual-purpose breed that originated in England around the time of the Roman conquest and is now popular in many countries. The Catuvellauni were a Celtic tribe or state in southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, attested by inscriptions in the 4th century. England has been inhabited for over 800,000 years, with evidence of early modern humans found in Devon. Continuous human habitation in England dates back to around 13,000 years ago, with remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age."]}

Boren"], "rewrite_passage": [" Here is a rewritten version of the passage, while preserving the semantics of the original text:\n\nBlock booking is a system in which movie studios sell multiple films to theaters in bulk, requiring theaters to show the films without selecting them sight unseen. This practice was prevalent among Hollywood's major studios from the early 1930s until it was deemed illegal by the US Supreme Court in 1948. Under block booking, studios could offer a mix of high-profile and lower-quality films to theaters, making production and distribution more cost-effective. This system also involved the purchase of unseen films, known as blind bidding. In the case of Baker v. Nelson (1971), the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a state law restricting marriage to opposite-sex couples did not violate the US Constitution. However, the US Supreme Court dismissed the appeal in 1972, and the case became precedent. In 2013, Minnesota legalized same-sex marriage, and in 2015, the US Supreme Court explicitly overturned the Baker decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, making same-sex marriage legal nationwide.\n\nIn the United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.

{"question": "A scam involving a male calling small town fast-food restaurants and pretending to be a police officer to have them strip search employees was turned into a movie of what name?", "answer": ["Compliance"], "rewrite_passage": [" Sure, here's a rephrased version of the passage:\n\nThe 2012 thriller film \"Compliance\" directed by Craig Zobel tells the story of a prank caller who convinces a fast-food restaurant manager to carry out intrusive and illegal procedures on an employee, despite the manager's initial reservations. The film is based on a real-life incident that occurred at a McDonald's restaurant in Kentucky, where a man posing as a police officer convinced the manager to conduct a strip search on a female employee. The film explores themes of obedience and the dangers of blindly following authority figures.\n\nThe plot focuses on Sandra, played by Ann Dowd, the manager of a fast-food restaurant who is convinced by the prank caller to conduct a series of humiliating and invasive procedures on an employee. Despite her initial hesitations, Sandra becomes increasingly compliant with the caller's demands, leading to a dangerous and unsettling situation.\n\nThe film is based on a true story that made headlines in 2004, when a man in Kentucky was arrested for making false statements on a visa application for his housekeeper. The incident highlights the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of questioning authority.\n\nIn addition to the \"Compliance\" film, there are several other examples of people being taken advantage of through prank calls. For instance, in 2016, an Indian diplomat named Devyani Khobragade was arrested in New York for making false statements on a visa application for her housekeeper. She was subjected to a body cavity search, which led to a major diplomatic standoff between India and the United States.\n\nPrank calls have also been used as a means of terrorizing fast-food restaurants and their employees. In Japan, there is a phenomenon known as \"part-time job terrorism,\" where employees perform pranks and stunts, such as climbing into ice cream freezers or holding their body horizontally suspended, on the counter-tops of fast-food restaurants. This behavior is often seen as a way to gain recognition from peers through social media.\n\nFinally, there are instances where people have been subjected to invasive and humiliating procedures as part of a routine strip search. These procedures can be far more invasive than a standard strip search performed on individuals taken into custody, and can involve the examination of body cavities for contraband.\n\nOverall, the passage highlights the dangers of blindly following authority figures and the importance of questioning unchecked power. It also raises awareness about the potential consequences of prank calls and the importance of treating fast-food restaurant employees with respect and dignity."]}

He is the prince of Denmark, the nephew of the usurping Claudius, and the son of King Hamlet, who was murdered by Claudius. At the beginning of the play, Hamlet struggles with whether and how to avenge his father's death, while also grappling with his own sanity. By the end of the tragedy, Hamlet has caused the deaths of several characters, including Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and two acquaintances of his from the University of Wittenberg, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. He is also indirectly involved in the deaths of his love Ophelia (drowning) and his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius by mistake).\n\nRomeo Montague is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet. He is the son of Montague and his wife, and he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet. After being forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death.\n\nShakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by William Shakespeare. Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as histories in the First Folio. The Roman tragedies—Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus—are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient, they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories. Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy. They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high-status central character, but end happily like Shakespearean comedies.\n\nAnna Devane is a fictional character from the original ABC Daytime soap opera, General Hospital, played by Finola Hughes. Hughes also appeared as Anna on All My Children, and the General Hospital prime time, spin-off series. The character first appeared on the April 10, 1985 episode of General Hospital as a fence.\n\nMacbeth is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatizes the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign. It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy.\n\nRevenge tragedy (less commonly referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) defines a genre of plays made popular in early modern England. Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article \"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays.\" Revenge tragedy is a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge, and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself.\n\nRory Williams is a fictional character portrayed by Arthur Darvill in the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who.

{"question": "What prolific English engineer, who died on 15 December 1857, contributed to the advent of the hot air engine by way of their open cycle devices?", "answer": ["George Cayley"], "rewrite_passage": ["Rephrased paragraph:\n\nElliott J. Stoddard invented and patented two versions of the Stoddard engine in 1919 and 1933. This type of engine is classified as an external combustion engine, as it uses a single-phase gaseous working fluid (such as hot air) to generate motion. The internal working fluid was originally air, although modern versions may use other gases like helium or hydrogen. Charles Stephen Boreham was a New Zealand shearer and trade unionist who was born in Tasmania, Australia in 1857. He is known for his work in the development of hot air engines, which are distinct from internal combustion engines and steam engines. A hot air engine is any heat engine that uses the expansion and contraction of air under the influence of a temperature change to convert thermal energy into mechanical work. These engines may be based on various thermodynamic cycles, including the closed cycle engine of Robert Stirling. Hot air engines are different from internal combustion engines and steam engines. The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle used in bipropellant rocket engines, where some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator to produce hot gas that powers the engine's pumps. The Stoddard engine is an external combustion engine where a working fluid, contained internally, is heated by combustion in an external source and then expands and acts on the engine's mechanism to produce motion and usable work. The working fluid is then cooled, compressed, and reused or dumped. Sir George Cayley, a prolific English engineer, is considered one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics for his understanding of the underlying principles and forces of flight. He developed the Daboll trumpet, an air trumpet foghorn that was essentially a small coal-fired hot air engine. Piccard Balloons, along with other manufacturers, was among the first to produce hot air balloons, beginning in the mid-1960s. Don Piccard, a descendant of aeronauts, built and sold some of the first modern hot air balloons, contributing to the sport of hot air ballooning through innovative design and construction. A Manson-Guise engine is an improved version of a Manson engine, a type of hot air engine that converts a temperature difference into motion. The Manson-Guise engine has a single con-rod with a displacer piston and power piston that move simultaneously. It can run in either direction, with the flywheel able to run clockwise or counterclockwise."]}

The andromeda lace bug, Stephanitis takeyai, is a pest insect that affects plants of the genus Pieris, particularly Pieris japonica, and has been introduced to other areas of the world beyond its native Japan.\n\nPieris is a genus of seven species of shrubs in the family Ericaceae, native to mountain regions of eastern and southern Asia, eastern North America, and Cuba. These broad-leaved evergreen shrubs can grow up to 1-3 meters tall and have leaves that are spirally arranged and appear to be in whorls at the end of each shoot with bare stretches of shoot below. The leaves are lanceolate-ovate, 2-long and 1.0- broad, leathery textured, and have an entire or serrated margin. The young leaves in spring are often brightly colored. The flowers are bell-shaped, 5-long, white or pink, and arranged in racemes 5-long. The fruit is a woody capsule that splits into five sections to release the numerous small seeds.\n\nPhlebodium is a small genus of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, with only two to four species recognized. These ferns are closely related to Polypodium, and the species were formerly included in that genus. Pieris floribunda is a North American species of broadleaf evergreen shrub, commonly known as mountain fetterbush or mountain andromeda. All parts of Pieris floribunda are poisonous if ingested, making it a rare plant to find in landscapes due to the difficulty in propagating it and its tendency not to adapt well to cultivation. However, some specialty and native plant nurseries sell it. In landscapes, it should be grown in full to part shade, out of windy locations, and have a good quality soil with lots of organic matter that is acidic with a pH of 4.5 to 6.5.\n\nThe whites or garden whites are a widespread and almost cosmopolitan genus of butterflies in the family Pieridae, with the highest species diversity found in the Palearctic region. Many species of this genus have caterpillars that feed on cabbage and other members of the Brassicaceae, and the chemical basis of this association has been studied for over 100 years. Pieris caterpillars are able to detoxify these chemicals, and have become so specialized that they will only eat plants that contain glucosinolates. The females of the genus also check for the presence of glucosinolates before laying eggs on a plant. The crop-damaging species of Pieris have spread from Eurasia to most of the rest of the world, and are considered pest insects almost everywhere, except for species such as Pieris oleracea and Pieris virginiensis, which are not pests and feed successfully only on specific native vegetation.\n\nIn conclusion, Sinopieris and Pieris are two distinct genera of butterflies and shrubs, respectively, with distinct characteristics and distributions. While Sinopieris is found in various regions of Asia and eastern North America, Pieris is found in mountain regions of eastern and southern Asia, eastern North America, and Cuba. The andromeda lace bug is a pest insect that affects plants of the genus Pieris, and the genus Phlebodium is a small group of ferns native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas."]}

{"question": "Which novelist, J. G. Farrell or Louis Aragon, wrote of the political and human consequences of his country's colonial rule?", "answer": ["Farrell"], "rewrite_passage": [" Here is a rephrased version of the passage:\n\nJames Gordon Farrell was a Liverpool-born novelist of Irish descent who gained prominence for his series of novels known as the Empire Trilogy, which explored the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. The Murree Rebellion of 1857, sometimes referred to as a war of independence, was a skirmish between tribes surrounding the Hill Station of Murree (now in modern-day Pakistan) and the British colonial government of India. Resistance against colonial rule had been mounting for many years, with occasional isolated uprisings and a sense of anticipation that colonial rule would be overthrown.\n\nLouis Aragon was a French poet and novelist who was a leading voice of the surrealist movement in France. He co-founded the surrealist review Littérature with André Breton and Philippe Soupault. The 1985 Hong Kong electoral reform introduced the first ever indirect election to the colonial legislature, laying the foundation for representative democracy in Hong Kong.\n\nLéo Ferré's album Les Chansons d'Aragon is a tribute to poet Louis Aragon, focusing on his poetry collection Le Roman inachevé. The album is Ferré's second dedicated to a poet after Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal. The origins of the Sri Lankan Civil War can be traced back to the political tension between the majority Sinhalese and the minority Sri Lankan Tamils, which dates back to colonial rule.\n\nFort Diu, located on the west coast of India in Diu, was built by the Portuguese during their colonial rule of the Diu island. The fort was built in 1535 and strengthened over the years until 1546. The Portuguese ruled Diu for 424 years, the longest colonial rule in the world, until they were forced to quit in 1961 during a military action launched by the Government of India.\n\nL'Affiche rouge is a song from Ferré's album Les Chansons d'Aragon, based on Aragon's poem Strophes pour se souvenir. The song is about the Red Poster affair, where the Germans plastered Paris with thousands of red posters denouncing members of the FTP-MOI executed by the Nazis in Mont-Valérien.\n\nMwambutsa IV Bangiricenge was the king of Burundi who ruled from 1915 to 1966. Born while Burundi was under German colonial rule, his reign mostly coincided with Belgian colonial rule from 1916 to 1962. The Belgians retained the monarchs of both Rwanda and Burundi under their policy of indirect rule."]}

Similar to ocean surfing, the best conditions occur when the wind blows offshore. However, on lakes, waves from previous onshore winds dissipate quickly, giving surfers a shorter time frame to catch good waves. Lake surfers often brave storms to catch waves, unlike ocean surfers who typically ride swells generated by distant storms. Strong winds can create rough water surfaces and make managing surfboards more challenging. With shorter distances for waves to form, lake surfers have less time between waves, sometimes needing to paddle through them to reach the lineup. Although freshwater reduces buoyancy and increases drag, it doesn't require significant changes to surfboard designs. Lake surfers enjoy the absence of saltwater and don't face the same marine life dangers as ocean surfers, such as sharks and jellyfish."]},

However, they can gain insight from trace fossils and paleopathology. To understand dinosaur behavior, scientists look at the poses of fossilized bodies, their habitats, use computer simulations for biomechanics, and compare them with modern animals. This understanding is speculative and likely controversial. Yet, there's agreement that some behaviors seen in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also present in dinosaurs. Many species gathered in herds for defense, migration, or to protect their young. Different types of dinosaurs formed groups of young individuals, and evidence suggests they communicated with their offspring, similar to modern birds and crocodiles. Certain features like crests and frills were likely used for displays rather than defense.

It mainly acts on the kidneys, controlling how much sodium is kept and how much potassium is released in the urine. This affects blood pressure and volume.

Named after its discoverer, Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, its main job is to help the kidney create a concentration gradient in the medulla.", "Low pressure receptors, also known as volume receptors, are sensors found in the venae cavae, pulmonary arteries, and atria. They detect changes in the tension of the vessel walls, which corresponds to how full the low-pressure part of the circulatory system is (below 60mmHg). These receptors send signals that control the release of hormones like antidiuretic hormone (ADH/Vasopressin), renin, and aldosterone. When atrial pressure rises, it leads to a decrease in ADH and aldosterone release, causing more urine to be produced and thus lowering blood pressure. Additionally, when atrial receptors stretch, they prompt the secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which encourages the kidneys to excrete more water and sodium through urine.", "Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a condition where acid builds up in the body because the kidneys can't properly make urine acidic. In the kidneys, blood is filtered, and the filtered fluid passes through tubules where salts, acids, and other substances are exchanged before becoming urine. RTA can happen because the kidneys either don't reabsorb enough bicarbonate ions (which are alkaline) in the early part of the tubules or don't release enough hydrogen ions (which are acidic) later on. Unlike kidney problems where the kidneys don't work well, RTA specifically refers to poor urine acidification in kidneys that are otherwise healthy. There are different types of RTA with different symptoms and causes.", "In the kidney's nephron, the ascending limb of the loop of Henle comes after the descending limb and the loop's sharp bend.

Each nephron, a functional unit in the kidney, has this feedback mechanism. It works by sending information from the renal tubules (where the tubular fluid is) to the glomerulus (where filtration begins). When the concentration of sodium chloride increases in the distal tubules, it triggers the release of adenosine from specific cells called macula densa cells.

During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called Great Recession of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created Watch Dog like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification."}], "output": "The arena where the Lewiston Maineiacs played their home games can seat 4,000 people, with 3,677 seats available.**"},

The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004.  Initiated by the group GMO Free Mendocino, the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood.  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.  Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of GMO free zones.

This district is a first-in-the-nation partnership between local and state governments, the university, and these nationally recognized healthcare faculties, designed to promote collaboration in research, innovation, education, grant funding, and community outreach, for the advancement of health and wellness in the greater Kansas City metropolitan area.  Also in 2017, the university announced plans to expand its metropolitan identity with the construction of a downtown Campus for the Arts, located near the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts.  The university's enrollment as of 2015 exceeded more than 16,600 students. Kansas City jazz is a style of jazz that developed in Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri and the surrounding Kansas City Metropolitan Area during the 1930s and marked the transition from the structured big band style to the musical improvisation style of Bebop.  The hard-swinging, bluesy transition style is bracketed by Count Basie who in 1929 signed with the Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra and Kansas City native Charlie Parker who was to usher in the Bebop style in the 1940s.  According to a Kansas City website, While New Orleans was the birthplace of jazz, America's music grew up in Kansas City.  Kansas City is known as one of the most popular cradles of jazz.  Other cities include New Orleans, Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and New York City. Kansas City Scout is one of the United States' largest electronic traffic management systems.  It was created in 2000 as part of a bi-state initiative between the Missouri Department of Transportation and the Kansas Department of Transportation to provide this system for the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, which is in both Missouri and Kansas (the anchor city of Kansas City is in Missouri).  The project's cost was $43 million.  Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.  KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost.  The system employs a system of electronic boards placed on major highways throughout the metropolitan area that display traffic information whenever information needs to be displayed (due to an accident, lane closure, highway closure etc.), and the system also has cameras on those billboards to automatically detect traffic problems.  While the system has extensive coverage of highways in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area it still has much more to cover.  Since it would be too expensive to cover all the major highways in the Kansas City metro (which has more miles of highway per person than any other metropolitan area in the United States), studies were conducted to determine which highways or segments of highways have priority due to higher accident rates.  Since the project's beginning, it has expanded greatly, and will continue to expand.  Future plans are to extend coverage to I-635 and cover I-435 even more (especially in the northern areas of the metro) as well as other major city highways.  It was named after the iconic Kansas City Scout Statue that exists in Penn Valley Park, overlooking Downtown Kansas City."}], "output": "The fight song of the University of Kansas, whose main campus is in Lawrence, Kansas, and branch campuses are in the Kansas City metropolitan area, is called \"Kansas Song (We’re From Kansas).\"**"},

The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers.  The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism.  It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation.  Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive. Front Row is a discontinued media center software application for Apple's Macintosh computers and Apple TV for navigating and viewing video, photos, podcasts, and music from a computer, optical disc, or the Internet through a 10-foot user interface (similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi).  The software relies on iTunes and iPhoto and is controlled by an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys.  The first version was released October 2005, with two major revisions since.  Front Row was removed and discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7.A universal remote is a remote control that can be programmed to operate various brands of one or more types of consumer electronics devices.  Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.  Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.  For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions. In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.  For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.  A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.  In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. The Siri Remote is a remote control device released in tandem with the 4th Generation Apple TV at an Apple Keynote Address by CEO Tim Cook on October 26, 2015 by Apple Inc. The Remote is designed specifically to work with the always-on Siri capable Apple TV.  The device is a successor of the original Apple Remote.  It is also compatible with the Apple TV 4K.

At the time of his death, he had been held for three days at the US base 10 miles south of Asadabad, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, on suspicion of involvement in a rocket attack on the same base.  The cause of his death was at first reported to be a heart attack, but this came into question when three members of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division came forward to testify that CIA contractor David Passaro assaulted Wali.  Passaro, a former U.S. Army Ranger, allegedly beat Wali for two consecutive nights, causing grievous injuries including a fractured pelvis.  Prosecutors would charge that Passaro ordered soldiers not to allow Wali to sleep, limited his access to food and water and subjected him to two consecutive nights of interrogation and beatings.  Among other injuries, Wali suffered a suspected fractured pelvis that would have made it impossible for him to urinate.  Witnesses testified that during one session Passaro, while wearing combat boots, kicked Wali in the groin hard enough to lift him off the ground, threw Wali to the ground, beat Wali on the arms and legs with a heavy Maglite flashlight, and that Passaro also vigorously thrust a flashlight into Wali's abdomen.  After the second night of beatings, Wali begged the soldiers to kill him and moaned a phrase that meant, I'm dying.  Wali died on his fourth day in custody.  He repeatedly denied any involvement in the rocket attacks. James A. Shoulders (May 13, 1928 – June 20, 2007) was an American professional rodeo cowboy and rancher.

Nungesser was a renowned ace in France, ranking third highest in the country with 43 air combat victories during World War I. L'Oiseau Blanc (commonly known in the English-speaking world as The White Bird ) was a French Levasseur PL.8 biplane that disappeared in 1927, during an attempt to make the first non-stop transatlantic flight between Paris and New York City to compete for the Orteig Prize.  The aircraft was flown by French World War I aviation heroes, Charles Nungesser and François Coli.  The aircraft took off from Paris on 8 May 1927 and was last seen over Ireland.  Less than two weeks later, Charles Lindbergh successfully made the New York–Paris journey and claimed the prize, flying the Spirit of St. Louis.François Coli (June 5, 1881 – presumably on or after May 8, 1927) was a French pilot and navigator best known as the one-eyed flying partner of Charles Nungesser in their doomed attempt to fly the Atlantic Ocean on the aircraft known as L'Oiseau Blanc. Georges Félix Madon (July 28, 1892 – November 11, 1924) was the fourth ranked French ace pilot of the First World War.  His lengthy career and wide variety of aviation experiences were remarkable.

He is best remembered as the creator of the ace pilot and adventurer Biggles. Gervais Raoul Victor Lufbery (March 14, 1885 – May 19, 1918) was a French and American fighter pilot and flying ace in World War I. Because he served in both the French Air Force, and later the United States Army Air Service in World War I, he is sometimes listed alternately as a French ace or as an American ace.  Officially, all but one of his 17 combat victories came while flying in French units."}], "output": "Charles Nungesser.** "},

The band's members are Kay Hanley, Greg McKenna, Michael Eisenstein, Stacy Jones, Scott Riebling, and later, Tom Polce. Screaming Trees was an American rock band formed in Ellensburg, Washington in 1985 by vocalist Mark Lanegan, guitarist Gary Lee Conner, bass player Van Conner and drummer Mark Pickerel.  Pickerel had been replaced by Barrett Martin by the time the band reached its most successful period.  Although widely associated with grunge, the band's sound incorporated hard rock and psychedelic elements.  During Screaming Trees' existence the band released seven studio albums, five EPs, and three compilations.Truly is an American rock band formed in the wake of the grunge era.  It featured singer-guitarist Robert Roth, bassist Hiro Yamamoto, and drummer Mark Pickerel.  Yamamoto and Pickerel were founding members respectively of Soundgarden and Screaming Trees.  While not a commercially successful group like some of their Seattle contemporaries, the band lasted a decade with two studio albums to their name. Change Has Come was the only recording the Screaming Trees released through Sub Pop.  Released in 1990 the Screaming Trees then moved on to a major label, Epic Records, for their next three albums - Uncle Anesthesia, Sweet Oblivion, and Dust, as well as the Something About Today EP. Jamboree is the second album by Beat Happening, released in 1988 through K Records/Rough Trade Records.  All songs were produced by Steve Fisk with assistance from Screaming Trees members Mark Lanegan and Gary Lee Conner (who plays a brief guitar solo on Midnight a Go-Go), except Cat Walk, produced by Patrick Maley, and The This Many Boyfriends Club, recorded live by Rich Jensen.  The album marks a darker approach to the Twee pop for which the band is known, due largely to a thicker production than is present on the group's earlier recordings and the dominance of tracks written by Calvin Johnson, while Heather Lewis only provides vocals on two songs, the uncharacteristically brash In Between and the more typically understated Ask Me.  At the time of the album's release, Calvin described Jamboree's sound as dark and sexy.  Still, the band retained their emphasis on exuberance over musicianship, as Bret Lunsford stated in an interview that, while recording album opener Bewitched, his guitar string got stuck on a protruding screw and he continued to play through the song, hitting the string a bit harder until it became unstuck. Gary Lee Conner (born Lee Gary Conner on August 22, 1962 in Fort Irwin, California, USA) was the lead guitarist for rock act Screaming Trees, along with his brother Van Conner, who was the band's bassist.  Conner began his career with Screaming Trees in 1985 which lasted until their disbanding in 2000.  During that time he released two non-Tree albums: The Purple Outside-Mystery Lane (1990 New Alliance Records) with brother Patrick Conner on Drums and the single Grasshopper's Daydream/Behind The Smile (1999 sub pop) this album also featured Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age.  Appearances on other artists material include, Beat Happening Indian Summer and Midnight a Go-Go from Jamboree as well as Against the 70s by Mike Watt from Ball-Hog or Tugboat?  (1995 Columbia Records).  After ten years of seclusion he finally released a new album in 2010 from his band Microdot Gnome.  The album 4D Sugarcubes was released on Moonbus International Recordings in April 2010 as was available on CD and MP3.  At the moment he is planning future releases from Microdot Gnome.

Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms.  After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government.  In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.  The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.  The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражда́нская война́ в Росси́и , Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi ; November 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.  The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.Communism in Russia began after Tsar Nicholas II lost his power during the February Revolution.  The Provisional Government was established under Prince Lvov, however, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the government and revolted in October 1917, taking control of Russia.  Vladmir Lenin, their leader, rose to power and governed between 1917 and 1924.  The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites.  In 1922 the Communist Reds were victorious, and formed the Soviet Union.  Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power.  He was the leader of the Communist Party until 1953.  He encouraged political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his dominance. Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov (Russian: Лавр Гео́ргиевич Корни́лов , ] ; 18 August 1870 – 13 April 1918) was a military intelligence officer, explorer, and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the ensuing Russian Civil War.  He is today best remembered for the Kornilov Affair, an unsuccessful endeavor in August/September 1917 that purported to strengthen Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government, but which led to Kerensky eventually having Kornilov arrested and charged with attempting a coup d'état, and ultimately undermined the rule of Kerensky; strengthening the claims and power of the soviets, and the Bolshevik party. The left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks were a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks by rival left-wing parties that started soon after the October Revolution, continued through the Russian Civil War, and lasted into the first few years of Soviet rule.  They were led or supported by left-wing groups such as some factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists.  The uprisings started in 1918 and continued during and after the Civil War until around 1924.  The Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to invite these groups to join the government and instead suppressed them with force. Louise Bryant (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American feminist, political activist, and journalist best known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution.  Bryant, who married writer John Reed, her second husband, in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky.  Her news stories, distributed by Hearst during and after her trips to Petrograd and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following World War I.  A collection of articles from her first trip was published in book form as Six Red Months in Russia in 1918.  During the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the Overman Committee, a Senate subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States.  Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce armed U.S. intervention in Russia."}], "output": "The Russian Civil War ended in 1922.**"},

The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.  The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times. A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants.  These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier.  These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.  Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier. The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog.  It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters.  The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail.  The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton. The Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: Русский той, Тойчик ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier.  There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat.  The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier.  Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the Terrier was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010.  The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia."}], "output": "The Manchester Terrier's ancestors include Gordon and Irish Setters.**"},

This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty. Giuseppe Edoardo Arimondi, OSML, OMS, OCI (Savigliano, 26 April 1846 – Adwa, 1 March 1896) was an Italian general, mostly known for his role during the First Italo-Ethiopian War.  He was one of the few European commanders who gained a victory over the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, soundly defeating them at Agordat in 1893.  After a long and successfull colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. Ethiopia–Japan relations are the international relations between Ethiopia and Japan.  Both were nations with an ancient history which successfully repulsed European military advances to dominate them, Ethiopia at the Battle of Adwa, and Japan at the Battle of Tsushima, and as a result both nations considered each other potential allies prior to World War II. Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name Ethiopia in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (Era of the Judges/Princes), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces. Saint Ephigenia of Ethiopia or Iphigenia of Ethiopia (Spanish: Efigênia ; Portuguese: Ifigênia ; French: Iphigénie ; ), also called Iphigenia of Abyssinia (1st century), is a folk saint whose life is told in the Golden Legend as a virgin converted to Christianity and then consecrated to God by St. Matthew the Apostle, who was spreading the Gospel to the region of Ethiopia, which in this case is understood to be located in the regions south of the Caspian Sea, either in one of the provinces of Mesopotamia (Assyria and Babylon), or in Ancient Armenia (Colchis)."}], "output": "The Battle of Adwa secured Ethiopian sovereignty.** "},

Supposedly, the Trash Box collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on Pebbles, Volume 4 have been eschewed entirely.  Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the Pebbles Box.  Although most of the recordings on the Trash Box were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series.  Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit I Fought the Law (but the Law Won) by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) – which is also included in the Pebbles Box – in place of the much rarer Wine Wine Wine by Bobby Fuller that appears on Pebbles, Volume 2. Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003.  At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format.  This box set, and the companion release Rancho Texicano, were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from ZZ Top's First Album, Rio Grande Mud, and Tejas, aside from 1977's The Best of ZZ Top which features two tracks from Rio Grande Mud and one track from First Album.  Tres Hombres and Fandango!  were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes. Live in Japan is a four-disc box set by American saxophonist John Coltrane and his last group, featuring the quintet of Coltrane, his wife/pianist Alice, saxophonist/bass clarinetist Pharoah Sanders, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Rashied Ali.  The 4-CD set compiles all the music issued as three albums in the seventies by Impulse! ; Concert In Japan (1973, US 2-LP, electronically processed for compatible quadrophonic/stereo), Coltrane In Japan (1974, Japan 3-LP (side six is blank), mono) and Second Night In Tokyo (1976, Japan 3-LP (side six contains an interview, mono).  (Some of this material was also reissued as two 2-LP sets in 1980 by MCA under the titles Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  1 and Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  2) The first CD issues were by Impulse!  Japan as two 2-CD sets: Live In Japan Vol.  1 (same as Coltrane In Japan) and Live In Japan Vol.  2 (same as Second Night In Tokyo).  The US 4-CD edition includes both of these volumes, with identical mastering from the original mono tapes.  The side six interview from Second Night In Tokyo has never been reissued on any CD edition. Nashville Rebel is a box set by Waylon Jennings, released on RCA Records through Legacy Recordings in 2006.  According to Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, it is the first comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembled, comprising ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with selections from the majority of the singer's recording career.  The first track of the box set is the Buddy Holly-produced Jole Blon, released in 1958, while the last is I Do Believe, a song produced by Don Was that was included on The Highwaymen's 1995 release, The Road Goes on Forever.  The other material on the box set covers Jennings' career chronologically, with songs ranging from his years on RCA's roster to later compositions from his short-lived stay at Epic Records; it ignores, however, the tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels.  The majority of the singer's charting singles are included in the package, as are collaborations such as Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys with Willie Nelson and Highwayman with The Highwaymen.  A notable addition is the previously unreleased The Greatest Cowboy of Them All, a 1978 duet with Johnny Cash which was later recorded by Cash alone for A Believer Sings the Truth (1979) and The Mystery of Life (1991); two others, It's Sure Been Fun and People in Dallas Got Hair, had never been released in the United States.  Nashville Rebel was released on four CDs, with a 140-page booklet and liner notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye."}], "output": "The writer of the song \"To Know Him Is to Love Him,\" which was the first track on the box set Back to Mono, is Phil Spector.**"},

Containing approximately 700 species, it is the largest genus in the family.  Common names include campion (which is shared with the related genus Lychnis) and catchfly.  Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Ferocactus is a genus of large barrel-shaped cacti, mostly with large spines and small flowers.  There are about 30 species included in the genus.  They are found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.Silene latifolia (formerly Melandrium album), the white campion is a dioecious flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae, native to most of Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa.  It is a herbaceous annual, occasionally biennial or a short-lived perennial plant, growing to between 40-80 centimetres tall.  It is also known in the USA as bladder campion but should not be confused with Silene vulgaris, which is more generally called Bladder Campion. Silene tomentosa, the Gibraltar campion, is a very rare flowering plant of the genus Silene and the family Caryophyllaceae.  It is a woody-based perennial about 40cm high, with bilobed flowers ranging from pink to pale violet and is endemic to Gibraltar. Silene conoidea is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names weed silene and large sand catchfly.  It is native to Eurasia, and it is known in other parts of the world, such as western North America, as a weed.  It is an annual herb growing up to a meter in height with a hairy, partially glandular stem.  The lance-shaped leaves are up to 12 centimeters long near the base of the plant and smaller farther up.  The flower is enclosed in an inflated, hairy, glandular calyx of fused sepals which is ridged with many veins.  It is open at the top, revealing five bright pink petals. Silene stenophylla is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae.  Commonly called narrow-leafed campion, it is a species in the genus Silene.  It grows in the Arctic tundra of far eastern Siberia and the mountains of Northern Japan.  Frozen samples, estimated via radiocarbon dating to be around 32,000 years old, were discovered in the same area as current living specimens, and in 2012 a team of scientists successfully regenerated a plant from the samples."}], "output": "Yes, both Silene and Ferocactus are types of plants.

From its formation in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps, it has flown a variety of aircraft types including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C).  During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions.  It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities.  The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937.  It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.  The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra.  It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C Wedgetail.  One of the six Boeing 737s was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS. The English Electric Canberra is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber that was manufactured during the 1950s.  It was developed by English Electric during the mid-to-late 1940s in response to a 1944 Air Ministry requirement for a successor to the wartime de Havilland Mosquito fast-bomber.  Amongst the performance requirements for the type was the demand for an outstanding high altitude bombing capability in addition to flying at high speeds.  These were partly accomplished by making use of newly developed jet propulsion technology.  When the Canberra was introduced to service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), the type's first operator, in May 1951, it became the service's first jet-powered bomber aircraft.The South West Pacific theatre, during World War II, was a major theatre of the war between the Allies and Japan.  It included the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (except for Sumatra), Borneo, Australia and its mandate Territory of New Guinea (including the Bismarck Archipelago) and the western part of the Solomon Islands.  This area was defined by the Allied powers' South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command. The Asiatic-Pacific Theater, was the theater of operations of U.S. forces during World War II in the Pacific War during 1941-45.  From mid-1942 until the end of the war in 1945, there were two U.S. operational commands in the Pacific.  The Pacific Ocean Areas (POA), divided into the Central Pacific Area, the North Pacific Area and the South Pacific Area, were commanded by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief Pacific Ocean Areas.  The South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was commanded by General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific Area.  During 1945, the United States added the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, commanded by General Carl A. Spaatz. The Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 Sparviero (Italian for sparrowhawk) was a three-engined Italian medium bomber with a wood-and-metal structure.  Originally designed as a fast passenger aircraft, between 1937 and 1939 this low-wing monoplane set 26 world records, qualifying it for some time as the fastest medium bomber in the world.  It first saw action during the Spanish Civil War and flew on all fronts in which Italy was involved during World War II.  It achieved success as a torpedo bomber in the Mediterranean theater, and became the best-known Italian aeroplane of the war.  It was easily recognizable due to its distinctive fuselage dorsal hump, and was well liked by its crews, who nicknamed it il gobbo maledetto (damned hunchback). South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was the name given to the Allied supreme military command in the South West Pacific Theatre of World War II.  It was one of four major Allied commands in the Pacific War.  SWPA included the Philippines, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies (excluding Sumatra), East Timor, Australia, the Territories of Papua and New Guinea, and the western part of the Solomon Islands.  It primarily consisted of United States and Australian forces, although Dutch, Filipino, British and other Allied forces also served in the SWPA."}], "output": "The British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber used in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II was the English Electric Canberra.**"},

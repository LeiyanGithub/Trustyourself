Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms.  After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government.  In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.  The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.  The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражда́нская война́ в Росси́и , Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi ; November 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.

Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) , was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.  After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only.  Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional.  (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.)  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed. Conscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars).  The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.  However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed."}], "output": "  Yes, that is correct. The Rostker v. Goldberg case, decided in 1981, held that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional. The Supreme Court ruled that the gender distinction in the draft law did not violate the equal protection component of the due process clause. The decision upheld the gender-based requirement for military conscription in the United States."},

Your answer should be clear, direct.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the name of the Isles who were led by Aonghus Mór and covered a total land area of over 8300 km2? \n\n Passage: Aonghus Mór mac Domhnaill (died c.1293) was a leading figure in the thirteenth-century kingdoms of the Isles and Scotland.  He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle.  Aonghus Mór appears to have succeeded his father in the mid part of the thirteenth century.  At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown.  Aonghus Mór's first certain appearance in the historical record seems to evince his involvement in aiding native Irish kindreds against the consolidation of Anglo-Irish authority in the north-west Ireland.  Such cooperation could have been undertaken in the context of overseas kindreds like Clann Domhnaill constructing Irish alliances to gain assistance against Scottish encroachment. The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD.  The islands were known to the Norse as the Suðreyjar, or Southern Isles as distinct from the Norðreyjar or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland.  The historical record is incomplete, and the kingdom was not a continuous entity throughout the entire period.  The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, although only some of the later rulers claimed that title.  At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney.  At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory.  The islands involved have a total land area of over 8300 km2 and extend for more than 500 km from north to south."}], "output": "  The Isles referred to in the passage are the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, which covers a total land area of over 8300 km2 and includes the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde, and the Isle of Man. The kingdom was led by Aonghus Mór mac Domhnaill in the mid-thirteenth century and was characterized by a degree of independence from external control, although at times the rulers had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland, or Orkney."},

Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.

The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the American League (AL) East division.  As one of the AL's original eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis, Missouri to become the St. Louis Browns.  After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney/civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. The team's current majority owner is lawyer Peter Angelos. Marcus Wayne Garland (born October 26, 1950) is a retired American right-handed pitcher who spent nine seasons from 1973 to 1981 in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Baltimore Orioles (1973–1976) and Cleveland Indians (1977–1981).  He was one of 24 ballplayers who profited from the advent of MLB free agency following the 1976 season.  A torn rotator cuff rendered his playing career into a cautionary tale of the risks of signing pitchers to free-agent contracts of seven years or longer.  The article outlined how Garland was constantly criticized by Cleveland's incompetent management for not living up to his contract (even though his decline in performance was entirely due to a serious arm injury that could not be fixed effectively by mid-1970's sports medicine) and had fans savagely booing him and even vandalizing his car during games."}], "output": "  Thank you for your question. Based on the provided passage, Marcus Wayne Garland played for the Baltimore Orioles from 1973 to 1976 and then for the Cleveland Indians from 1977 to 1981, spanning a total of nine seasons in Major League Baseball.

{"question": "The lamp used in many lighthouses is similiar to this type of lamp patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand?", "answer": ["Argand lamp"], "prompt": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a question-answering assistant.

Your answer should be clear, direct.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The lamp used in many lighthouses is similiar to this type of lamp patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand? \n\n Passage: The Argand lamp, a kind of oil lamp, was invented and patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand.  Its output is 6 to 10 candela, brighter than that of earlier lamps.  Its more complete combustion of the candle wick and oil than in other lamps required much less frequent trimming of the wick. The Lewis lamp is a type of light fixture used in lighthouses.  It was invented by Winslow Lewis who patented the design in 1810.  The primary marketing point of the Lewis lamp was that it used less than half the oil of the prior oil lamps which they replaced.  The lamp used a similar design to an Argand lamp, adding a parabolic reflector behind the lamp and a magnifying lens made from 4 in green bottle glass in front of the lamp.  A similar variant using a parabolic reflector was created by the inventor of the Argand lamp, Aimé Argand.  While the Argand variant became widely used by European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp design was selected by the United States for use in American lighthouses."}], "output": "  Yes, that is correct. The Lewis lamp, used in many lighthouses, is similar in design to the Argand lamp, which was patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand.

It was fought by American and Filipino forces against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.  The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of over 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting in the Pacific theater.  Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle.  Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's foundation.  The battle ended the almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines (1942–1945).  The city's capture was marked as General Douglas MacArthur's key to victory in the campaign of reconquest. The Seven Days Battles were a series of six major battles over the seven days from June 25 to July 1, 1862, near Richmond, Virginia, during the American Civil War.  Confederate General Robert E. Lee drove the invading Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula.

Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love. Within You Without You is a song written by George Harrison and released on the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after Love You To, and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September–October 1966.  Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle.  The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.  Although the song was his only composition on Sgt. Pepper, Harrison's endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover."}], "output": "  Based on the provided passage, the English musician known for both \"See Yourself\" and \"Within You Without You\" is George Harrison."},

The name honours Italian naturalist Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (1656–1730). Brabejum is a genus of a single species of large evergreen tree, Brabejum stellatifolium in the Proteaceae, commonly called wild almond, bitter almond or ghoeboontjie.  It is restricted in the wild to South Africa's Western Cape Province, where it grows in thickets along the banks of streams.  The plant is of botanical interest as being Africa's only member of the large grevilleoid subfamily.  It is a bushy small tree with branches widely at ground level and numerous erect vigorous stems.  Leaves to 6 in (15 cm) long, narrow and bluntly toothed, appear at intervals along the branches, mostly in whorls of 6.  In summer, the plant bears white flowers densely crowded on spikes arising from rusty buds at the leaf axils.  The fruits to 2 in (5 cm) long, magenta to reddish brown, similar to an almond, appear in autumn.  The nut is too bitter to eat; however, in earlier times it was boiled, roasted, and ground to make a coffee drink."}], "output": "  Based on the provided knowledge, the genus Marsilea contains more individual species of plants than the genus Brabejum.

They are anabolic and increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles, and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of the vocal cords and body hair.  The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, that which is thrown up, mound.  They are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. Anabolic/androgenic steroids are drugs that are obtained from the male hormone, testosterone.  Anabolic steroids are used for muscle-building and strength gain for cosmetic reasons as well as for performance-enhancement in athletics and bodybuilding.  Anabolic steroids work in many ways by increasing protein synthesis in the muscles and by eliminating the catabolic process (the process of breaking down skeletal muscle for energy).  It is common for teens and adults to use steroids as they stimulate and encourage muscle growth much more rapidly than natural body building."}], "output": "  Anabolic steroids (AAS) are commonly used in bodybuilding to promote muscle growth and strength gain.

Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964) was a United States Supreme Court case that ruled that unlike in the election of the United States Senate, in the election of any chamber of a state legislature the electoral districts must be roughly equal in population (thus negating the traditional function of a State Senate, which was to allow rural counties to counter balance large towns and cities).  The case was brought on behalf of voters in Alabama by M.O. Sims, a taxpayer in Birmingham, Alabama, but affected both northern and southern states that had similarly failed to reapportion their legislatures in keeping with changes in state population after its application in five companion cases in Colorado, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware.

The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera, in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s, the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season.  The owners of the theatre, usually noble amateurs, charged the impresario with hiring a composer (until the 1850s operas were expected to be new) and the orchestra, singers, costumes and sets, all while assuming considerable financial risk.  In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce Der Schauspieldirektor (The Impresario).  Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice, where his opera Orlando finto pazzo was followed by numerous others.

Human eyes perceive blue when observing light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green.  Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres.  In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments, along with red and yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours.  Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green.  Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB colour model, used to create all the colours on the screen of a television or computer monitor. Innocent Records was a pop record label created to cater to for EMI's Virgin Records more pop oriented acts.

Your answer should be clear, direct.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What produces the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron? \n\n Passage: Angiotensin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and a subsequent increase in blood pressure.  It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that raises blood pressure.  Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex.  Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up. Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.  It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon.  It plays a central role in the regulation of the plasma sodium (Na), the extracellular potassium (K) and arterial blood pressure.  It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.  It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume.  When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease.  Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart."}], "output": "  Angiotensin, a peptide hormone, stimulates the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron and contributes to increased blood pressure."},

Based on the following knowledge, please answer the question more succinctly and professionally. Your answer should be clear, direct.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Which avant-garde Japanese composer studied with John Cage and wrote Music for Electric Metronomes? \n\n Passage: Music for Electric Metronomes is an avant-garde aleatoric composition written in 1960 by Japanese composer Toshi Ichiyanagi for any number of performers between three and eight.  The piece involves the manipulation of electric metronomes, followed by various unspecified sounds and actions.  It is a very theatrical piece, and reflects Ichiyanagi's affiliation with Fluxus, an experimental art movement from the sixties.  The only true scored instrument is an electric metronome for each individual player, though the varying sounds and/or actions may involve many different instruments and objects at the discretion of the performer.  Because the graphic notation of score (which is a series of dashes, lines, and numbers in an erratic pattern of connected paths) leaves a lot of room for personal interpretation and expression, each performance is unique, and almost certainly cannot be reproduced.  There is no conductor for the performance.  It has been recorded on the album Toshi Ichiyanagi: 1960's & 1990's.  In a review of a performance by the S.E.M. Ensemble in 1992 at the Paula Cooper Gallery, the music critic of The New York Times, Alex Ross, described the piece as merely a timid, spastic prelude to György Ligeti's monumental Poème symphonique for 100 metronomes. Toshi Ichiyanagi (一柳 慧 , Ichiyanagi Toshi , born 4 February 1933) is a Japanese composer of avant-garde music.  He studied with Tomojiro Ikenouchi, Kishio Hirao, and John Cage."}], "output": "  Toshi Ichiyanagi is the Japanese composer who wrote \"Music for Electric Metronomes.\" He studied with John Cage and was affiliated with the Fluxus experimental art movement.

Titus Andronicus, probably written between 1588 and 1593, appeared in three quarto editions from 1594 to 1601 with no named author.  It was first published under William Shakespeare's name in the 1623 First Folio of his plays.  However, as with some of his early and late plays, scholars have long surmised that Shakespeare might have collaborated with another playwright.  Other plays have also been examined for evidence of co-authorship, but none has been as closely scrutinised or as consistently questioned than Titus.  The principal contender for the co-authorship is George Peele. Like most playwrights of his period, William Shakespeare did not always write alone.  A number of his surviving plays are collaborative, or were revised by others after their original composition, although the exact number is open to debate.  Some of the following attributions, such as The Two Noble Kinsmen, have well-attested contemporary documentation; others, such as Titus Andronicus, are dependent on linguistic analysis by modern scholars; recent work on computer analysis of textual style (word use, word and phrase patterns) has given reason to believe that parts of some of the plays ascribed to Shakespeare are actually by other writers."}], "output": "  Scholars have given various foundations for the likelihood of collaboration on a William Shakespeare play written between 1588 and 1593, including:\n\n1. Linguistic analysis: Some scholars have used linguistic analysis to suggest that certain parts of Shakespeare's plays, including Titus Andronicus, may have been written by other writers.\n2. Contemporary documentation: There is some contemporary documentation that supports the idea of collaboration on some of Shakespeare's plays, such as The Two Noble Kinsmen, which has well-attested contemporary documentation.\n3. Computer analysis of textual style: Recent work on computer analysis of textual style has suggested that parts of some of the plays ascribed to Shakespeare may be actually written by other writers.\n4. Collaborative nature of playwriting in the 16th century: It was common for playwrights of the time to collaborate on plays, and William Shakespeare did not always write alone.\n\nOverall, while the exact number of collaborative plays attributed to Shakespeare is open to debate, there is evidence to suggest that he may have collaborated on some of his plays, including Titus Andronicus, during this time period."},

Wolfe presents an as-if-firsthand account of the experiences of Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters, who traveled across the country in a colorfully painted school bus named Further.  Kesey and the Pranksters became famous for their use of LSD and other psychedelic drugs in hopes of achieving intersubjectivity.  The book chronicles the Acid Tests (parties in which LSD-laced Kool-Aid was used to obtain a communal trip), the group's encounters with (in)famous figures of the time, including famous authors, Hells Angels, and The Grateful Dead, and it also describes Kesey's exile to Mexico and his arrests. Further, also known as Furthur, is a 1939 International Harvester school bus purchased by author Ken Kesey in 1964 to carry his Merry Band of Pranksters cross-country, filming their counterculture adventures as they went.  Due to the chaos of the trip and editing difficulties, the footage of their journey was never released as a movie until the 2011 documentary film Magic Trip -- although the bus featured prominently in Tom Wolfe's 1968 book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test."}], "output": ""},

Its tessitura, or comfortable range, is normally defined by the outermost lines of the bass clef.  Categories of bass voices vary according to national style and classification system.  Italians favour subdividing basses into the basso cantante (singing bass), basso buffo (funny bass), or the dramatic basso profondo (low bass).

As a staff officer at the beginning of World War I, he was Chief of Staff of the 8th Army.  Hoffmann, along with Hindenburg and Ludendorff, masterminded the devastating defeat of the Russian armies at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes.  He then held the position of Chief of Staff of the Eastern Front.  At the end of 1917, he negotiated with Russia to sign the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.  In 1922, he tried to set up an anti-Soviet coalition without success. The Battle of Tannenberg was fought between Russia and Germany from 26–30 August 1914, during the first month of World War I.  The battle resulted in the almost complete destruction of the Russian Second Army and the suicide of its commanding general, Alexander Samsonov.  A series of follow-up battles (First Masurian Lakes) destroyed most of the First Army as well and kept the Russians off balance until the spring of 1915.  The battle is particularly notable for fast rail movements by the Germans, enabling them to concentrate against each of the two Russian armies in turn, and also for the failure of the Russians to encode their radio messages.  It brought considerable prestige to Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and his rising staff-officer Erich Ludendorff."}], "output": ""},

Active as a group between 1985 and 1995, these four artists recorded three major label albums as The Highwaymen: two on Columbia Records and one for Liberty Records.  Their Columbia works produced three chart singles, including the number one Highwayman in 1985. Highwayman is a song written by American singer-songwriter Jimmy Webb, about a soul with incarnations in four different places in time and history: as a highwayman, a sailor, a construction worker on the Hoover Dam, and finally as a captain of a starship.  The song was influenced by the real-life hanged highwayman Jonathan Wild.  The dam builder verse alludes to the deaths of over one hundred men during the construction of Hoover Dam near Boulder City, Nevada.  Webb first recorded the song on his album El Mirage, released in May 1977.  The following year, Glen Campbell recorded his version, which was released on his 1979 album Highwayman.  In 1985, the song became the inspiration for the naming of the supergroup The Highwaymen, which featured Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson.  Their first album, Highwayman, became a number one platinum-selling album, and their version of the song went to number one on the Hot Country Songs Billboard chart in a twenty-week run.  Their version earned Webb a Grammy Award for Best Country Song in 1986.  The song has since been recorded by other artists.  Webb himself included a different version on his 1996 album Ten Easy Pieces, a live version on his 2007 album Live and at Large, and a duet version with Mark Knopfler on 2010 album Just Across the River."}], "output": ""},

Based on the following knowledge, please answer the question more succinctly and professionally. Your answer should be clear, direct.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Whose native growing land is more south, Beech or Daviesia? \n\n Passage: Daviesia, commonly known as Bitter-peas, is a large genus of flowering plants in the legume family.  They are native to Australia, with a center of diversity in western Australia.  The genus is named in honour of Hugh Davies, a Welsh botanist.  They have nitrogen-fixing bacteria contained in root nodules like other genera in their family. Beech (Fagus) is a genus of deciduous trees in the family Fagaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia and North America.  Recent classification systems of the genus recognize ten to thirteen species in two distinct subgenera, Engleriana and Fagus.  The Engleriana subgenus is found only in East Asia, and is notably distinct from the Fagus subgenus in that these beeches are low-branching trees, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark.  Further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom on the underside of the leaves, the visible tertiary leaf veins, and a long, smooth cupule-peduncle.  Fagus japonica, Fagus engleriana, and the species F. okamotoi, proposed by the botanist Chung-Fu Shen in 1992, comprise this subgenus.  The better known Fagus subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark.  This group includes Fagus sylvatica, Fagus grandifolia, Fagus crenata, Fagus lucida, Fagus longipetiolata, and Fagus hayatae.  The classification of the European beech, Fagus sylvatica is complex, with a variety of different names proposed for different species and subspecies within this region (for example Fagus taurica, Fagus orientalis, and Fagus moesica).  Research suggests that beeches in Eurasia differentiated fairly late in evolutionary history, during the Miocene.  The populations in this area represent a range of often overlapping morphotypes, though genetic analysis does not clearly support separate species."}], "output": ""},

Based on the following knowledge, please answer the question more succinctly and professionally. Your answer should be clear, direct.\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What kind of energy does a plasma weapon produce? \n\n Passage: When discussing weapons in science fiction, a plasma weapon is a type of raygun that fires a stream, bolt(s), pulse or toroid of plasma (i.e. very hot, very energetic excited matter).  The primary damage mechanism of these fictional weapons is usually thermal transfer; it typically causes serious burns, and often immediate death of living creatures, and melts or evaporates other materials.  In certain fiction, plasma weapons may also have a significant kinetic energy component, that is to say the ionized material is projected with sufficient momentum to cause some secondary impact damage in addition to causing high thermal damage.  In some fictions, like Star Wars, plasma is highly effective against mechanical targets such as droids.  The ionized gas disrupts their systems. Plasma (from Ancient Greek πλάσμα , meaning moldable substance or jelly) can simply be considered as a gaseous mixture of negatively charged electrons and highly charged positive ions, however, true plasma production is from the distinct separation of these ions and electrons that produces an electric field, which in turn, produces electric currents and magnetic fields. Plasma is one of the four fundamental states of matter and was first introduced by chemist Irving Langmuir in the 1920s.  Unlike, the other three states of solid, liquid, and gas, plasma does not freely exist on the Earth.  Plasma can be generated by heating neutral gases or by subjecting gas to a strong electromagnetic field."}], "output": ""},

The process of jumping directly from high school to the professional level is also known as going prep-to-pro.  Since 2006, the practice of drafting high school players has been prohibited by the new collective bargaining agreement, which requires that players who entered the draft be 19 years of age and at least one year removed from high school.  Contrary to popular belief, the player does not have to play at least a year in college basketball, as the player can choose to instead play in another professional league (especially overseas) like Brandon Jennings or Emmanuel Mudiay in Italy and China respectively, simply take the year off, such as the case with Satnam Singh Bhamara, or even hold themselves back a year in high school before declaring for the draft, such as the case with Thon Maker.

Dover Area School District, et al. (400 F. Supp.  2d 707, Docket No. 4cv2688) was the first direct challenge brought in the United States federal courts testing a public school district policy that required the teaching of intelligent design.  In October 2004, the Dover Area School District of York County, Pennsylvania, changed its biology teaching curriculum to require that intelligent design be presented as an alternative to evolution theory, and that Of Pandas and People, a textbook advocating intelligent design, was to be used as a reference book.  The prominence of this textbook during the trial was such that the case is sometimes referred to as the Dover Panda Trial, a name which recalls the popular name of the Scopes Monkey Trial in Tennessee, 80 years earlier.  The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  The judge's decision sparked considerable response from both supporters and critics. Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial is an award-winning NOVA documentary on the case of Kitzmiller v.

It is named for Director-General of New Netherland Willem Kieft, who had ordered an attack without approval of his advisory council and against the wishes of the colonists.  Dutch soldiers attacked Lenape camps and massacred the native inhabitants, which encouraged unification among the regional Algonquian tribes against the Dutch, and precipitated waves of attacks on both sides.  This was one of the earliest conflicts between Native Americans and European settlers.  Displeased with Kieft, the Dutch West India Company recalled him and he died while returning to the Netherlands.  Peter Stuyvesant succeeded him in New Netherland.  Because of the continuing threat by the Algonquians, numerous Dutch settlers returned to the Netherlands, and growth of the colony slowed. The Pound Ridge massacre was a battle of Kieft's War that took place in March 1644 between the forces of New Netherland and members of the Wappinger Confederacy at a Wappinger Confederacy village in the present-day town of Pound Ridge, New York.  A mixed force of 130 Dutch and English soldiers led by Captain John Underhill launched a night attack on the village and destroyed it with fire.  500 to 700 members of the Wappinger Confederacy were killed while the New Netherland force lost one man killed and fifteen wounded.

A five-star rank with NATO code OF-10, it is equivalent to an Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy or a Marshal of the Royal Air Force in the Royal Air Force (RAF).  A Field Marshal's insignia consists of two crossed batons surrounded by yellow leaves below St Edward's Crown.  Like Marshals of the RAF and Admirals of the Fleet, Field Marshals traditionally remain officers for life, though on half-pay when not in an appointment.  The rank has been used sporadically throughout its history and was vacant during parts of the 18th and 19th centuries (when all former holders of the rank were deceased).  After the Second World War, it became standard practice to appoint the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (later renamed Chief of the General Staff) to the rank on his last day in the post.  Army officers occupying the post of Chief of the Defence Staff, the professional head of all the British Armed Forces, were usually promoted to the rank upon their appointment.

It was funded by $250,000 from the Institute for Creation Research and over $1 million in donations.  The RATE team was chaired by Larry Vardiman (meteorology) and included Steven A. Austin (soft rock geology), John Baumgardner (geophysics), Steven W. Boyd (Hebrew), Eugene F. Chaffin (physics), Donald B. DeYoung (physics), Russell Humphreys (physics) and Andrew Snelling (hard rock geology). Kevin R. Henke is an American geochemist and former instructor at the University of Kentucky's department of Geology.  He currently works as a senior research scientist at the University of Kentucky's Center for Applied Energy Research.  He is well known for his criticism of young earth creationism and the scientific arguments they make for a young earth.  In particular, he has been critical of the RATE project's results, which claim to show that zircons contain too much helium to be billions of years old, and has argued that Russell Humphreys, a young-earth creationist who was involved in the project, has made errors in his research.  These flaws include that, according to Henke, The vast majority of Humphreys et al.'s critical a, b, and Q/Q0 values that are used in these dating equations are either missing, poorly defined, improperly measured or inaccurate.  Henke has also accused Humphreys of misidentifying his specimens, fudging his data, and not considering the possibility of helium contamination in this research.  He has also criticized John Woodmorappe for arguing that radiometric dating is unreliable.  On one occasion, Henke called Kent Hovind on the phone regarding Hovind's $250,000 challenge to prove evolution.  Hovind told Henke that in order to win the money he would have to recreate the Big Bang in a laboratory.  Henke responded by proposing several alternative proofs that pertained to geology (his field of expertise), but Hovind refused, saying that the project must be chosen by him and it must not pertain to the area in which Henke has scientific expertise.  Hovind therefore required Henke to prove that dogs and bananas had a common ancestor, and lowered the award to only $2,000 should he succeed.  Henke accepted the challenge, and later drafted a contract, which was then posted on Talk.origins.  However, one of Henke's requirements was that the judges be unbiased, and Hovind rejected the challenge for this reason, insisting that he should be the only one who can choose the judges."}], "output": ""},

The actual dispatch was an internal message from the Prussian King's vacationing site to Otto von Bismarck in Berlin, reporting demands made by the French ambassador; it was Bismarck's released statement to the press that became known as Ems Dispatch.  The name referred to Bad Ems, a resort spa east of Koblenz on the Lahn river, then situated in Hesse-Nassau, a new possession of Prussia. Otto Eduard Leopold, Prince of Bismarck, Duke of Lauenburg (1 April 1815 – 30 July 1898), known as Otto von Bismarck (] ), was a conservative Prussian statesman who dominated German and European affairs from the 1860s until 1890.  In the 1860s, he engineered a series of wars that unified the German states, deliberately excluding Austria, into a powerful German Empire under Prussian leadership.  With that accomplished by 1871, he skillfully used balance of power diplomacy to maintain Germany's position in a Europe which, despite many disputes and war scares, remained at peace.  For historian Eric Hobsbawm, it was Bismarck who remained undisputed world champion at the game of multilateral diplomatic chess for almost twenty years after 1871, [and] devoted himself exclusively, and successfully, to maintaining peace between the powers.  However, his annexation of Alsace-Lorraine gave new fuel to French nationalism and promoted Germanophobia in France.  This helped set the stage for the First World War."}], "output": ""},

Jackson, 475 U.S. 625 (1986) .  The case concerned the validity of a defendant's waiver of his right to counsel during a police interrogation.  In reversing Jackson, the Court said such a waiver was valid. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992) , was a landmark United States Supreme Court case in which the constitutionality of several Pennsylvania state statutory provisions regarding abortion was challenged.  The Court's plurality opinion reaffirmed the central holding of Roe v. Wade stating that matters, involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy, are central to the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Court's plurality opinion upheld the constitutional right to have an abortion while altering the standard for analyzing restrictions on that right, crafting the undue burden standard for abortion restrictions.  Planned Parenthood v. Casey differs from Roe, however, because under Roe the state could not regulate abortions in the first trimester whereas under Planned Parenthood v. Casey the state can regulate abortions in the first trimester, or any point before the point of viability, and beyond as long as that regulation does not pose an undue burden on women's fundamental right to an abortion.  Applying this new standard of review, the Court upheld four regulations and invalidated the requirement of spousal notification."}], "output": ""},

He became Chief after the death of his half-brother Hākau, who inherited the lands of his father to rule.  Umi-a-Liloa was considered a just ruler, religious and the first to unite almost all of the Big Island.  The legend of Umi is one of the most popular hero sagas in Hawaiian history.

The movie was one of many Amicus horror anthologies made during the 1970s and features an all star cast, including Joan Collins, Peter Cushing, Richard Greene, and Roy Dotrice, with Ralph Richardson as the Crypt Keeper.

The words have not changed very much in two and a half centuries.  It is sung to a variant of the 1761 French melody Ah!  vous dirai-je, maman.  Uncorroborated theories have been advanced to explain the meaning of the rhyme.  These include that it is a complaint against Medieval English taxes on wool and that it is about the slave trade.  In the twentieth century it was a subject of controversies in debates about political correctness.  It has been used in literature and popular culture as a metaphor and allusion.  The Roud Folk Song Index classifies the lyrics and their variations as number 4439. Teletubbies say Eh-oh!  is a hit single which was number one in the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in December 1997.  It remained in the Top 75 for 29 weeks after its first release and three weeks more after two re-releases and sold well enough to be certified as double-platinum.  It is mostly a remix of the theme song from the hit BBC TV show, Teletubbies.  It was also a massive hit in the Republic of Ireland, peaking at number two.

It drains part of the Midlands eastwards to The Wash.  The river rises in the Hothorpe Hills, at Sibbertoft in Northamptonshire, then flows generally northeast to Market Harborough, Stamford and Spalding, to reach The Wash near Fosdyke.  It is a major waterway across the part of the Fens called South Holland, and is one of the Fenland rivers which were laid out with washlands.  There are two channels between widely spaced embankments with the intention that flood waters would have space in which to spread while the tide in the estuary prevented free egress.  However, after the floods of 1947, new works such as the Coronation Channel were constructed to control flooding in Spalding and the washes are no longer used solely as pasture, but may be used for arable farming. The Rolls-Royce RB.23 Welland was Britain's first production jet engine.  It entered production in 1943 for the Gloster Meteor.  The name Welland is taken from the River Welland, in keeping with the Rolls-Royce policy of naming early jet engines after rivers based on the idea of continuous flow, air through the engine and water in a river."}], "output": ""},

Depending on the cat registry, they may be considered a separate breed of cat, or more often a variant of a pre-existing one, if accepted at all.  These cats are distinguished by their conformance to wide range of sixteen different point colors, beyond the four standard Siamese colors.  The variety was initially created by crossbreeding Siamese with the American Shorthair – the same mixture that created the Oriental Shorthair, but with different goals.  The Colorpoint Shorthair shares the point-coloration pattern with the Siamese, but in the nontraditional colors of red, cream, tortoiseshell, and lynx (tabby) points, and minor variations thereof.  In body style, head shape, and other features, it may be intermediate between the two foundation breeds, which show cats leaning toward Siamese traits.  Those who favour the Traditional Siamese look may also favour the more moderate-typed Colourpoint Shorthairs that take after their American Shorthair ancestors in shape. Point coloration refers to animal coat coloration with a pale body and relatively darker extremities, i.e. the face, ears, feet, tail, and (in males) scrotum.  It is most recognized as the coloration of Siamese and related breeds of cat, but can be found in rabbits, rats, sheep, and horses as well."}], "output": ""},

The main varieties of whales hunted were humpback, blue, right and sperm whales. Right whales are three species of large baleen whales of the genus Eubalaena: the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis), the North Pacific right whale (E. japonica) and the Southern right whale (E. australis).  They are classified in the family Balaenidae with the bowhead whale.  Right whales have rotund bodies with arching rostrums, V-shaped blowholes and dark gray or black skin.  The most distinguishing feature of a right whale is the rough patches of skin on its head which appear white due to parasitism by whale lice.  Right whales can grow up to more than 18 m long with the maximum record of 19.8 m and weigh up to 100 ST or more; 20.7 m with 135000 kg or 21.3 m with uncertainty, being significantly larger than other coastal species such as humpbacks, grays, or eden's and omura's, but smaller than blues.

Swift and Rose composed the song about one of Swift's ex-boyfriends, when Swift discovered he was not what she had perceived of him.  It focused on the moment where Swift accepted that the relationship was over.  White Horse is, musically, a country song and uses sparse production to emphasize vocals.  Lyrically, the track speaks of disillusionment and pain in a relationship, drawing references to fairytales."}], "output": ""},

It was created on 29 June 1646 for Nicholas Barnewall, who had earlier represented County Dublin in the Irish House of Commons.  The Kingsland Barnewalls were a junior branch of the family of Baron Trimleston; Nicholas's great-grandfather Sir Patrick Barnewall had achieved political prominence through his friendship with Thomas Cromwell and done well out of the Dissolution of the Monasteries .  Nicholas was made Baron Turvey at the same time, also in the Peerage of Ireland.  His grandson, the third Viscount, was a supporter of James II and outlawed.  However, he was restored under the Treaty of Limerick.  His son, the fourth Viscount, was a Roman Catholic and consequently disqualified from taking his seat in the Irish House of Lords.  He was childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the fifth Viscount.  He was the son of the Honourable George Barnewall, younger son of the third Viscount.  He died unmarried in 1800 when the titles became dormant.  They were successfully claimed in 1814 by Matthew Barnewall, who became the sixth Viscount.  He was the great-grandson of the Honourable Richard Barnewall, younger son of the first Viscount.  However, he had no surviving male issue and on his death in 1834 the titles are considered to have become extinct. James II and VII (14 October 1633 – 16 September 1701) was King of England and Ireland as James II and King of Scotland as James VII, from 6 February 1685 until he was deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688.  He was the last Roman Catholic monarch of England, Scotland and Ireland."}], "output": ""},

He was king of the Greek tribe of Molossians, of the royal Aeacid house (from c. 297 BC), and later he became king of Epirus (r. 306–302, 297–272 BC).  He was one of the strongest opponents of early Rome.  Some of his battles, though successful, caused him heavy losses, from which the term Pyrrhic victory was coined.  He is the subject of one of Plutarch's Parallel Lives. Pandosia (Greek: Πανδοσία ) was an ancient town of Lucania (now Basilicata), Italy, situated near Heraclea.  It has often been confounded with Pandosia in Bruttium; but the distinct existence of a Lucanian town of the name is clearly established by two authorities.  Plutarch describes Pyrrhus as encamping in the plain between Pandosia and Heraclea, with the river Siris (modern Sinni) in front of him; and the celebrated Tabulae Heracleenses repeatedly refer to the existence of a town of the name in the immediate neighborhood of Heraclea.  From these notices we may infer that it was situated at a very short distance from Heraclea, but apparently further inland; and its site has been fixed with some probability at a spot called , about 11 km from the sea, and 6.5 km from Heraclea."}], "output": ""},

In what month did Francis Asbury begin attending the revival meetings ? \n\n Passage: The Revival of 1800 was a series of evangelical Christian meetings which began in Logan County, Kentucky, which ignited the subsequent events and influenced several of the leaders of the Second Great Awakening.  The events represented a transition from traditions carried over from Europe to innovations that responded to the unique needs and personality of Americans in the new century.  The startling manifestations of revival fervor that first occurred in June 1800 at the Red River Meeting House, a small Presbyterian congregation led by James McGready, began as a Scottish sacrament service, but brought about the important innovation of serial religious services later known as camp meetings.  These multi-day gatherings hosted people from great distances for outdoor services focused on the heart-felt conversion and religious enthusiasm that came to characterize especially rural evangelicalism throughout the nineteenth century.  The Logan County revival quickly spread into the larger Cumberland region of southwestern Kentucky and middle Tennessee and expanded outward in all directions attracting the attention of evangelical leaders such as Presbyterian-turned-Disciples of Christ leader, Barton Stone, and Methodists Francis Asbury and Peter Cartwright, as well as leaders in the Shaker and Cumberland Presbyterian movements, all of whom attended the revival meetings in their initial year-long period beginning in June 1800 and continuing through May 1801.

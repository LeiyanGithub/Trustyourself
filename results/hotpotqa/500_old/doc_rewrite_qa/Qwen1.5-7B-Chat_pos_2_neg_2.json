A lot of people, mostly ordinary people, died. Some say it was one of the worst events in European history.\nRussia's communism started after the Tsar was removed during a revolution. A group called the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, took control in October 1917 and created the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. They had a big fight called the Russian Civil War with others. In 1922, the Bolsheviks won and formed the Soviet Union. Lenin passed away and Joseph Stalin, who was also a Communist, took over in 1924.

It's smaller and stronger than the American Rat Terrier, with shorter legs and heavier bones.

Since it was mainly a farm, hunting, and work dog, there wasn't much planned breeding. It has traits from other dogs like Feists, Bull Terriers, and Beagles.\n\nThese early terriers were mixed with Beagle or Beagle-like dogs for better scenting. This breeding created a dog with a great sense of smell, high intelligence, and a strong desire to work with its owner. Even though they can be a bit distant with strangers, they are loyal and always want to be by their owner's side. \nA Feist is a small dog that comes from a group of terriers brought to the US by workers from England.

They picked a big player named Alonzo Mourning from Georgetown with the second choice in the draft. With Mourning, Larry Johnson (a good player), and Muggsy Bogues, they didn't do very well most of the time, but they improved towards the end and finished with 44 wins and 38 losses. This helped them finish third in their division and get into the playoffs for the first time. Mourning was a key player, hitting a game-winning shot in the first round, but they lost to the New York Knicks in the next round. This made them the first of the four new teams from the late 1980s to win a playoff series. \nTyrone Bogues, born on January 9, 1965, was a basketball player from America who stood only 5 feet tall. He played as a point guard in the NBA for 14 seasons, even though he was the shortest player in the league's history.

This is because the original team in New Orleans, which used to be called the Hornets, changed its name to Pelicans. The current Charlotte Hornets continue the history and records of the old team from 1988 to 2002. \nThe Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball team, from Texas Tech University, has had 9 players play in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) since it started in 1997.

Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional? \n\n Passage: \nIn 1981, a big group of important people in the United States, called the Supreme Court, decided that it was okay for only men to have to sign up for a special program called the draft. This decision was made after many talks and discussions in the government. Before, the law said the same thing for men only. Some lawyers, like Robert L. Goldberg, didn't agree with this and tried to say it was not fair. But the Supreme Court, with a vote of 6-3, said that the law was not against fairness, and it would stay as it was. \nIn the United States, the government has used something called the draft, which is like a requirement for young men to join the army, during four big fights: Civil War, World War 1, World War 2, and a long cold one. The draft started again in 1940 for the first time during peace, and it lasted until 1973. This means that, except for when everyone自愿报名， young men were chosen to join the army during these times. But now, the army only takes volunteers, and they have a system called Selective Service to be ready if they need more people again in the future. Even though the draft is not used now, all young men between 18 and 25 still need to register with this system.\nOn May 9, 2010, in Kiev, there was a big event called the Victory Day Parade to celebrate the 65th anniversary of how the Soviet Union won a big war. The boss of the army, General Ivan Svyda, came to watch. The leader of Ukraine's army, General Gennady Vorobyov, was in charge of the parade. The President, Viktor Yanukovych, also spoke. 2,500 soldiers from Russia and Belarus, who are part of Ukraine's army, were there. There were 17 music groups, led by Major General Volodymyr Derkach, who is in charge of army music. \nThe Indian armed forces and veterans have been asking for something called One Rank One Pension (OROP) for a long time. This means that when someone reaches the same rank and has the same amount of time serving, they should get the same pension, no matter when they retire. The idea came from a need for fairness, because in 1973, when the government led by Indira Gandhi made a change to pensions without talking to the military, it made the military pensions lower by 20-40% while increasing civilian pensions by 20%. This decision was seen as unfair. A reference for this information is [V Mahalingam, 21/9]."}], "output": "\nThe practice of the draft, which required young men to sign up for the armed forces in the United States.**"},

The group is connected to the Discovery Institute, which is the main place for intelligent design ideas. \nExplanation: The Discovery Institute (DI) is a group in Seattle that supports conservative ideas. They are famous for talking about intelligent design, which is not really science. They want schools in the US to teach both this idea and ideas about evolution, even though most scientists agree evolution is true. Their goal is to make people think there's a debate about these topics in science classes.Every Voice is a group that supports making US politics more equal.

Some people believe he might be the same famous king Guiderius from legend. \nThe Catuvellauni were a Celtic group or place in southern Britain before the Romans came, and we know about them from writings from the 4th century.\nExplanation: The paragraph is about the culture that developed in Britain after the Romans arrived in AD 43 and formed a province called Britannia. This culture combined Roman and Celtic traditions because the Britons were already living there. Even after the Romans left in the 5th century, there was still a type of culture in southern Britain that lasted until the Anglo-Saxons came in around AD 597. They wrote in a Latin-like language called vernacular Latin during that time.\n\n Simplified: The culture in Britain during Roman times had parts from both the Romans and the local Britons. After the Romans left in the 5th century, there was a special culture in southern Britain that survived and used a Latin-like language until the Anglo-Saxons arrived in the 6th century. \nThe history of Wales started a long time ago when people first came to the area. Neanderthals lived in Wales over 230,000 years ago, and humans arrived around 31,000 BC. Modern humans have lived continuously in Wales since around 9,000 BC, leaving behind artifacts from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, the people who lived there spoke a language called Brittonic and were part of a group called Celtic Britons. The Romans came to Wales in the 400s and by 79 had defeated the Ordovices, taking control of the region. After the Romans left in the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons invaded, and the Brittonic language and culture began to change. The Welsh people, who were a big part of this group, started to develop their own identity separate from other Brittonic-speaking peoples by the 11th century."}], "output": "\nThe Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 and ruled southeastern Britain prior to conquest by the Roman Empire is King Togodumnus.**"},

People in South Jutland, where the coast is, also spoke it, but we don't have any old books from that area. Before that, the people living between the sea and Ems River, which are now called Frisians, only have a few names and place names that show their language. Old Frisian later turned into Middle Frisian, spoken until the 19th century. \nThe Leda is a river in Germany, found in the Lower Saxony part of the state. It starts near the town of Barßel, where Sagter Ems and Soeste (Dreyschloot) join together. It flows into the Ems river near Leer.

It's not as common as English, but the second most widely spoken Germanic language overall. \nEnglish is a language spoken all around the world because it started in England a long time ago. It comes from the Angles, a group of people who moved to England. It's related to a language called Frisian, but it has also learned words from other Germanic languages like Norse, and even some words from Latin and French."}], "output": "\nThe Western Germanic language spoken from which the small settlement situated on the river Leda opposite Leer derives its name is not directly mentioned in the passage. However, since the settlement is called \"Kloster Muhde\" and Old Frisian is mentioned as spoken in the region, it's likely that the name has its roots in Old Frisian. Old Frisian, as you mentioned, was spoken by the Frisians, a group whose language evolved into Middle Frisian. Therefore, the name \"Kloster Muhde\" might have a Frisian origin.**"},

He wrote it in 1967 when he was in the Beatles. The song was inspired by Paul McCartney's talk about taking a special drug called LSD, which made people upset. This happened after John Lennon said the Beatles were more popular than religion in 1966. The song is about being mindful of your actions and thinking about their effects. The music is different because it changes time rules, and the words remind us of songs from the Beatles, like Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love, from that time. \nWithin You Without You is a song from the Beatles' 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. George Harrison wrote it and it's his second song with Indian classical influences, inspired by his time in India learning from Ravi Shankar, a sitar teacher. The song was made without the other Beatles in London and has Indian instruments like sitar, dilruba, and tabla. It's different from their usual style, and it's about Indian spirituality, reflecting Harrison's interest in Hindu philosophy. Even though it's on the album, Harrison also showed his love for Indian culture by having Paramahansa Yogananda, a yoga teacher, in the album cover picture.\nLove Songs: A Compilation...

She and David Life founded the Jivamukti Yoga Method, which became very popular in the West during the late 20th century. This yoga style focuses on making everyone, including animals, equal and helping people find enlightenment by being kind and protecting the environment. It teaches that to be truly happy, one must prioritize the well-being of all beings. Jivamukti yoga also suggests a vegan diet to minimize harm to the earth and others.\n\nThe core belief in Jivamukti is 'shunyata', meaning everything is connected and comes from our perception. The idea is that to change the world, start with changing yourself and your thoughts. This leads to a non-judgmental and responsible approach, where one's actions affect others and their own self-perception.\n\nGannon believes that treating others well leads to how others treat you, which in turn influences how you see yourself, and ultimately, who you are."}], "output": "\nThe English musician known for both the songs See Yourself and Withing You Without You is George Harrison, a member of The Beatles.**"},

They want to find out more about their Icelandic roots and go on a journey to Iceland to explore it.

The premiums don't change with age, and you can usually pay them until you die, or choose to pay them fully in specific timeframes like 10, 20, or 65.

This case, also known as the Hollywood Antitrust Case, was about movie studios that owned their own theaters and didn't let other theaters show their films. The court said this wasn't fair and went against the US laws that stop businesses from making agreements to not work with others. This decision changed the way movies were made, shared, and shown in theaters. \nIn the case Craig v. Boren in 1976, the top court in the US said that rules or actions based on someone's sex could be judged under a more careful examination (intermediate scrutiny) because they were part of a bigger promise in the Fourteenth Amendment to treat everyone equally. This was the first time the court made such a decision.\nBlock booking is when a theater buys many movies at once from a movie studio. It was very common in Hollywood during the 1930s, but the Supreme Court stopped it in 1948. Independent theaters had to agree to show a lot of the studio's movies without seeing them first.

The stadium opened in 2011 for soccer games and can hold 18,467 people, but it can grow to 25,000 for concerts. Most games get around 21,000 people. This stadium is the third place the Wizards, the old team, played, first at Arrowhead Stadium from 1996 to 2007, then at CommunityAmerica Ballpark from 2008 to 2010.

It comes out每周一次 and is made by Time Inc. UK, with the editor being Ali Hall. \nChrysalis was a magazine for women, started in 1977 by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie in Los Angeles. They created it at a place called the Woman's Building. The magazine was different because it combined lots of things like politics, books, art, and culture. It was made by a group of women who shared ideas together, called consciousness-raising. The magazine had famous writers like Audre Lorde, Robin Morgan, and Adrienne Rich, who were important in the feminist movement. They made ten issues, but in 1981, they had to stop because they didn't have enough money.\nA women's magazine started in Malaysia in 1932. By the 2000s, there were about fifty local magazines for women, and some of them had an Islamic focus.

Here's a simpler version: \n\nBergson, born in 1859 and died in 1941, was a famous philosopher from France who had a big influence between the 1900s and the 1940s, even in philosophy discussions after the war. \nThomas Friedman, born on July 20, 1953, is an American writer and journalist who has won three Pulitzer Prizes.\nExplanation of Metaphysics is a 1903 book by Henri Bergson. He believes that reality is not like a list of separate things, but more like a continuous flow, like what some philosophers talk about. Reality can't be fully understood by just looking at parts separately. Bergson says we should try to feel or understand the whole, not just observe it from the outside. This means we should try to connect with the object, not just observe it. \nDuration is a idea about time and how we experience it, created by a French thinker named Henri Bergson. He thought that the way time is understood by scientists and math, like Herbert Spencer, wasn't right because they couldn't understand how it feels or how it changes for each person. Bergson believed that time is not like a straight line we can measure, but more like a continuous flow that can speed up or slow down. Instead of trying to measure each moment, we understand it through our personal experiences and feelings.\n\nBergson decided to focus on the inner world of humans, which is a type of duration that is not just one thing but also not many things at once. It's hard to explain directly because it's a deep, personal feeling that can't be fully described. We can understand it better by thinking creatively and imagining it, not by using exact numbers or pictures."}], "output": "\nThomas Friedman has won more Pulitzer Prizes than Henri Bergson.**"},

In 1960, the Privy Council made a rule that this name applies to their male grandchildren, even if they don't have royal titles. Some people with royal titles don't usually have a surname, but if they need one, they can use Mountbatten-Windsor. \nThe Mountbatten family comes from a long line of European royalty, originally from a German family called the Battenberg. During a time when many British people didn't like Germany, they changed their name to Mountbatten in the UK. This name comes from Battenberg, a little town in Germany. In the 1800s, a part of the Hesse-Darmstadt family, which is a smaller branch of the Hesse family, got a special title called count or prince of Battenberg.\nThe Zulu royal family includes the current king, King Goodwill Zwelithini, his wives, direct children, close relatives, and male descendants from his great-grandfather, King Mpande. King Mpande ruled from 1840 to 1872. King Shaka, who was his half-brother and the Zulu leader, expanded the kingdom greatly by making it a powerful pre-colonial region in what is now KwaZulu-Natal, thanks to his policies and conquests. \nA cadet branch is like a smaller group in a family tree.

They can be natural or made in a lab and help build muscles by increasing protein in cells, especially in our muscles. They can also make a person's body more masculine, like having more body hair and a deeper voice. The word anabolic comes from a Greek word that means throwing up or building up. There are three types of hormones that affect sex, and anabolic steroids are one of them, along with estrogen and progesterone. \nAnabolic/androgenic steroids are medicines made from testosterone, a man's hormone. They help people build muscles and get stronger for looking good and doing better in sports or bodybuilding. These drugs make muscles grow faster by helping to make more proteins and stopping the body from breaking them down. Many teenagers and grown-ups use them because they can help muscles grow very quickly, not just naturally.\nDocking means cutting off an animal's tail or ears, but cropping is mostly used for ears. Tail docking is more common, but tailing is also used. People call the part of the tail where hair grows the dock because it's the living flesh. \nTensile testing, also called tension testing, is a basic test in materials science. It involves stretching a sample under controlled tension until it breaks. The information from this test helps choose materials for specific jobs, makes sure they're good, and shows how they behave under normal pressure. The test measures things like how strong a material is (ultimate tensile strength), how much it stretches (maximum elongation), and how its shape changes (reduction in area). Other properties like Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, and how it gets harder to stretch (strain-hardening) can also be found. For most regular materials, uniaxial testing is used. But for materials that have different strength in different directions, like composites or textiles, biaxial testing is needed."}], "output": "\nAnabolic/androgenic steroids.**"},

However, just being very similar isn't enough to say they copied. The similarity needs to be so strong that it's impossible for the work to have been made without copying.\nWest v.

In the past, when opera was very popular in Italy, from the 1700s to the 1830s, an impresario was the main person who made sure everything for an opera season was set up. They found the composer, the musicians, the costumes, and the theater. But they also took big risks with their money. Mozart even made a funny play about it in 1786. There was a man named Antonio Vivaldi who was both an impresario and a composer, he managed opera shows in Venice in 1714. \nVanessa Bley is a singer, composer, producer, and musician from New York and LA.

He's part of two groups, St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble and the Orchestra of St. Luke's. He's been with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra since 1984 and has been the main horn player since 2003. Before that, he played with the New York Philharmonic for 14 years and even made appearances with famous musicians like the Boehm Quintette.\n\nHe's a skilled soloist too, performing at places like Carnegie Hall and in various festivals. He studied at Juilliard, where he learned from Ranier DeIntinis. Anderer is busy with recordings, chamber music, operas, symphonies, and even does TV commercials and films. He's been on albums by popular artists like Dawn Upshaw, Billy Joel, and Tony Bennett & k.d. lang.\n\nHe's also a teacher, coaching at the Verbier Festival and part of the faculty at New York University's Steinhardt School. \nA freight forwarder is like a helper who organizes and sends big packages from the person who made them to the person who will buy them. They work with different companies that use things like trucks, planes, or trains to move the goods. The forwarder does not actually move the stuff, but they know how to plan the whole journey, from the factory to the customer's place. They might use more than one mode of transportation for one delivery, like first taking it by truck to the airport and then by another truck to the customer's building."}], "output": "\nImpresario.**"},

The bridge is 30 feet long, 42 feet wide, and has a big arch that's 13 feet high. The outside is made of big, not smooth, granite blocks and the arch is very nicely shaped. There are big, 4.5 feet wide, 2 feet thick slabs on the sides to keep people safe. \nWorcester is a city in Massachusetts, USA, where people live. It's the second biggest city in New England after Boston. It's about 40 miles from Boston, 50 from Springfield, and 40 from Providence.

But some people in Minden, who wanted to be the county's new main town, didn't like it. But the county still said yes and built the new jail.

It started on October 24, 1994 and ended on February 15, 1997. The show is about special creatures called gargoyles that can turn into stone during the day.

These walls can be very big, stretching up to several hundred meters, and can be seen best from above. The name desert kites came from pilots who first spotted them in the 1920s.\n\nThere are about 2,000 of these structures identified in Jordan and Syria, but not much is known about them in Saudi Arabia.

The kites are estimated to be around 3,000 to 5,000 years old, with older dates being disproven by more recent studies. The younger age suggests that these hunts took place after people started farming, not during prehistoric times.\n\nSome rock art near the kites suggests that these hunts might have been big community events, involving people from multiple settlements and possibly having religious significance. \nThe 2000 Race of a Thousand Years was a long race in the American Le Mans Series, held on December 31, 2000, at the Adelaide Street Circuit in Australia.

He was known for creating designs in the Mid-Century modern style and was one of the first designers to bring Scandinavian design to the United States. \nScandinavian design, which started in the 1950s, is about simple, clean, and useful designs. It comes from five countries in Northern Europe: Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark. Even though Scandinavia usually means Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, people often use it to talk about all five countries together.\nCharles Lim, the founder of Peliontech, created a new term called Workflow Resource Planning (WRP) in 2003. This was to describe a new kind of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. Most ERP software simply helps with data entry and processing. But Lim changed this by adding workflow features to the core of his WRP software, which he called Radix ERP. Workflow, where tasks are organized and managed, was already known, but it was mainly used in a program called Lotus Notes before it became less popular in 2000. Mr. Lim took the concept from Lotus Notes and combined it with ERP systems to create Radix WRP, a new type of ERP that makes workflow management easier. \nExplanation: An NTFS symbolic link, or symlink, is like a special kind of file that points to another file or folder in the NTFS file system. When you see a symlink, it looks like a normal file or directory, but it actually leads to the target file or folder. NTFS introduced these links starting with version 3.0 in Windows 2000, especially for directories and volumes. From version 3.1, you can create symlinks for any file type. However, at first, this feature was not available in regular programs. Some third-party drivers, like Masatoshi Kimura's, made it work in user mode.

When we look at light, blue light is between 450 and 495 tiny parts called nanometres. Blue with shorter wavelength (more like violet) has higher frequency, and the other end, green, has longer wavelength with lower frequency. Pure blue has a wavelength of 470 nanometres. In art, blue is one of three main colors, along with red and yellow, which can make many more colors when mixed together. Red and blue make purple, and blue and yellow make green. Blue is also a key color in something called RGB, which helps make all the colors on a TV or computer screen. \nInnocent Records was a pop music label started by Virgin Records to have more pop acts. After the Spice Girls became popular, Virgin wanted to focus on pop too. They got a man named Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records, who helped Take That become a big hit.

This goddess is mentioned in a poem from the Poetic Edda, made in the 1300s based on older stories. The Prose Edda, also written in the 1300s by Snorri Sturluson, and skaldic poetry also mention her. Some people think Hlín might be another way to call Frigg. \nNorse mythology is a collection of stories and beliefs from the people who lived in Northern Germany and parts of Scandinavia.

The book not only focuses on their relationship but also talks about the French Enlightenment period. \nGabrielle Le Tonnelier, also known as Marquise Du Châtelet, was a French scientist from the early 1730s. She was a philosopher, mathematician, physicist, and writer. Her most important work was translating and explaining Isaac Newton's famous book, Principia, about physics. Sadly, she died in 1749 just before the book was published. Even though she passed away, her translation, published in 1759, is still the most trusted French version today.

It's part of a system called renin-angiotensin, and doctors often use medicines to target this system for high blood pressure. Angiotensin also makes the adrenal gland release a hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone helps the body keep more sodium in the kidneys, which in turn makes blood pressure go up. \nAldosterone is a hormone made by the adrenal gland's zona glomerulosa. It helps keep the body's sodium levels in balance by controlling how much is taken in and removed through the kidneys, salivary glands, sweat glands, and colon. It affects blood pressure by talking to special receptors in the kidneys. When aldosterone isn't working right, it can cause health problems like high blood pressure and heart or kidney issues. It's the opposite of a hormone the heart makes to help reduce sodium and blood pressure.\nThe Sodium-Chloride Symporter is a special helper in our kidneys that takes in sodium and chloride from the water in our tubes and sends it back into the cells. It's part of a bigger group called SLC12 cotransporters. In people, the gene for this helper is found on chromosome 16, labeled as SLC12A3. \nThe loop of Henle, found in the kidney, is a part of a nephron that moves from the top to the bottom part.

Jones case, decided by the Supreme Court of Florida in 1973, was the first time a court in the US applied the idea of comparative negligence in accidents, not just by law but through a judicial decision. It was a very important case because it changed the rule that if someone was hurt in an accident, they couldn't get compensation if they also contributed to the problem, a rule called contributory negligence which was very old, almost 150 years. Instead, the court said people could still get some compensation for the part of the harm caused by the person who was at fault, even if they were partly to blame.

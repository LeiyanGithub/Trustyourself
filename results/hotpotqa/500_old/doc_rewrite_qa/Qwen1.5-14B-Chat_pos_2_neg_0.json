But this decision affected other states too, especially those in the north and south, who didn't adjust their legislature based on population changes. It happened because similar cases were also decided in Colorado, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware. \nIn the 1984 case Selle v. Gibb, the Seventh Circuit Court ruled that if there's no proof of copying through access (like having access to someone else's work) and the similarity between two works is so strong it's hard to believe they were created independently, without influence, or from a common source, it might suggest copying.

It's a versatile space that opened in 1958. In 1965, a very famous sports picture was taken there, showing Muhammed Ali defeating Sonny Liston during a big boxing match for the World Heavyweight Title. \nThe Lewiston Maineiacs were a junior ice hockey team in Maine, part of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. They played their games at a place called the Androscoggin Bank Colisée. This team was the second in the United States to be in the QMJHL and was unique because it completed its whole season there. They won a big prize called the President's Cup in 2007.\nThe Billings Bulls were a youth ice hockey team from Billings, Montana. They played in a small arena, the Centennial Ice Arena, which could hold only 550 people. It was always full when they had games because people loved watching. Before, they played in a bigger place called Metrapark that could hold up to 9,000 people, but they had a problem with the people in charge and the county, so they had to stop playing there. \nThe Robins Center is a big place in Richmond, Virginia, with 7,201 seats, where people go to watch sports and events. It was opened in 1972 and is used by the University of Richmond's basketball team. In 1983, they had a big basketball tournament there. The arena is named after a man, E. Claiborne Robins Sr., who helped a lot with the school. Before the Robins Center, the team played games in different places around Richmond, like a big gym, a arena, and even a school. It's also a special place for important events like graduations and had a big debate in 1992. \nThe QMJHL, a hockey league in Quebec, started its 2011-12 season in September and went on until March. There were 17 teams playing 68 games each. Blainville-Boisbriand Armada, a new team, started playing in Boisbriand after moving from Verdun. Unfortunately, the Lewiston Maineiacs stopped playing, and the league decided to add a new team in Sherbrooke for next season. The Saint John Sea Dogs became the first team to win two championships in a row. \nLoan modification is a process where mortgage loan agreements are changed to help people having trouble paying by lowering interest rates, monthly payments, or reducing the principal amount. This is done by lenders to prevent foreclosures and save borrowers from financial distress. It started after the 2008 housing market crash in the US, with major banks like Washington Mutual, Chase, and JP Morgan among others involved. Some employees involved in mortgage and real estate had illegal practices, leading to the creation of the FBI Mortgage Fraud Department and government programs like HAMP (Home Affordable Modification Program) and HARP (Home Affordable Refinance Program) to help homeowners through legal modifications.\n\nBefore the crash, during the Great Depression, similar programs were used to help reduce foreclosures. However, during the 2008 recession, loan modifications became a national policy to prevent further economic problems. The focus was on assisting homeowners who were victims of predatory lending practices and unethical behavior by lenders, brokers, and attorneys.\n\nTo address the issues, the IRS created teams called HAMP TEAMS to develop new loan modification products. These modifications were designed to be legal and fair, helping homeowners avoid losing their homes due to illegal actions by lending institutions. As a result, the FBI and other government agencies were tasked with monitoring lending institutions to ensure compliance and prevent fraud.\n\nThe key point is that the crash was not caused by the housing market but by the loan products and the unethical practices of lenders who took advantage of homeowners, particularly through balloon mortgages. Modifications were introduced to correct these issues, and the government took action to protect consumers and hold banks accountable for their wrongdoings.\n\nIn conclusion, loan modification is a legal process that helps struggling homeowners by adjusting mortgage terms to avoid foreclosures. It was created in response to the 2008 housing market crash, where illegal practices by lending institutions were exposed, leading to government intervention and the establishment of programs to ensure fairness and protect the rights of mortgage note holders. \nCase Gym is a big room with 1,800 seats in Boston, Massachusetts. It opened in 1972 and is inside a place called the Harold Case Physical Education Center, named after a leader at the university. It's called The Roof because it's on top of the building. The gym has teams for basketball, wrestling, and they play there. For basketball games in the America East Conference, they went to Agganis Arena, but for non-conference games, they still played at Case Gym when Boston University changed their conference in 2013. \nThe 2007 MasterCard Memorial Cup, a big hockey game for young players, was played in Vancouver, British Columbia in May. It was the 89th time they had this special competition to find the best junior hockey team in Canada. The teams were from the Western Hockey League (WHL), Ontario Hockey League (OHL), Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL), and the Vancouver Giants, who were the hosts and had won before. The game was like a round-robin, with all four teams playing each other. The Giants won the cup, beating Medicine Hat 3-1, and they had the most people watching (121,561) which was even more than the last time in 2003."}], "output": "\nThe Lewiston Maineiacs played their home games at the Androscoggin Bank Coliseum, which could seat up to 4,000 people.**"},

This decision came from a vote on March 2, 2004. People who wanted this, called GMO Free Mendocino, were from local farms and groups who thought GMOs might be bad for people's health and the environment, but not everyone agreed. Some big companies that make and sell seeds, like Monsanto, DuPont, and Dow Chemical, didn't like this. Because of the ban, Mendocino County is now on a list of places that don't allow GMOs.

It helps control some Apple devices like computers and an old media program called Front Row. It was especially used with Apple TV until the fourth generation, when it was replaced by the Siri Remote. Before this, Apple made other remote controls without names for things like older TVs and extra parts for them. \nFront Row was a program for Mac computers and Apple TV that helped people watch videos, pictures, podcasts, and music from their computer, discs, or the internet. It used iTunes and iPhoto, and you could use an Apple Remote or keyboard keys to control it. It started in 2005 and got some updates, but it was taken away and stopped working in Mac OS X 10.7.\nA universal remote is a remote that can work with different kinds of electronic gadgets from different brands. Low-cost ones can control only a few devices, but better ones (mid- and high-end) can add new control codes, making it more flexible. Some electronic gadgets come with universal remote features that let them control other devices besides the one they were made for, like a VCR remote can control TVs. \nA remote control is a tool that lets you control an electronic device without touching it from far away. For example, in your living room, you can use it to turn on your TV or DVD player without having to be right next to them. It's a helpful feature because it lets you use devices that are hard to reach, like a garage door opener from outside or a projector on a high ceiling. \nExplanation: The paragraph is about a remote control called the Siri Remote, made by Apple. It was shown at a special event by Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, on October 26, 2015, along with the 4th generation Apple TV. The Siri Remote is made to work well with the Apple TV that always has Siri, and it replaces the old one. It even works with the newer Apple TV 4K.\n\nRevised paragraph: The Siri Remote is a remote made by Apple for their 4th generation Apple TV. It was introduced by Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, at a meeting in 2015. It's designed to work with the Apple TV that can use Siri. It's an updated version of the earlier remote and can also be used with the Apple TV 4K. \nNetSupport Manager is a software that lets you control and manage other computers remotely, from Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, or even mobile devices like Windows Mobile and tablets. It was first made for DOS in 1989, but now it supports showing small pictures of remote systems and switching between them like a KVM switch. You can send files, talk, and check hardware and software on the other device. For Linux and Mac, it has fewer features. In 2012, they added support for iOS, Android, and Mac OS, and in 2013, it even works with ChromeOS. To use it, you need to install it on both the controlling and the controlled devices. \nApple Watch is a smartwatch made by Apple. It helps you stay healthy and works with their phones and other Apple things. It comes in different sizes and looks with different bands. You need an iPhone to use it for things like calling and messaging. It was first made and sold in 2015 and became very popular. They made a new version in 2016 and another one in 2017. \nMacScan is a tool made for Mac OS X by SecureMac that helps remove bad things called malware, like spyware and sneaky programs that record your keystrokes. It was the first one to do this for Macs. It also checks if other programs that can control your computer from far away, like Apple Remote Desktop, are there only because you allowed them to be."}], "output": "\nNetSupport Manager and MacScan.**"},

It started as Kaiser Steel, created by Henry J. Kaiser, to make steel for ships during World War II when the shipbuilding industry was growing. During the Korean War, when the industry shrunk, it grew again.

Kornilov tried to support a government leader named Alexander Kerensky, but his plan didn't work. Kerensky caught Kornilov and thought he was trying to take power. This made Kerensky lose trust and the Bolsheviks, who were supported by the people, became stronger. \nExplanation: The paragraph is about the反抗 Bolsheviks from the left side, which were reactions from other left groups against the Bolsheviks after a big change in Russia in 1917. These uprisings happened during a big war (Russian Civil War) and continued even when the Bolsheviks controlled the country. The groups involved were not always on the same side, like the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Left Socialists, Mensheviks, and anarchists. The uprisings lasted until around 1924. The Bolsheviks tried to stop these groups from joining their government and used force to do so. \n\n Simplified: After a big change in Russia in 1917, there were rebellions from other left groups against the Bolsheviks, who were in control. These uprisings, called the left-wing uprisings, lasted from 1918 to 1924. The Bolsheviks didn't want these groups to join their government and often used force to stop them. \nLouise Bryant was an American lady who worked as a journalist and activist. She wrote about the Russian Revolution, which was happening from 1917, and was very friendly to the people in charge like Lenin and Trotsky. She got married to a writer named John Reed in 1916. Her stories about Russia, especially during the war, were printed in newspapers in the US and Canada. She even wrote a book called Six Red Months in Russia in 1918 about her first trip. Then, she talked to a special group of senators in 1919 to explain why she thought the revolution was good. Finally, she went on a tour to tell people about the revolution and asked them not to send soldiers to help. Louise Bryant passed away in 1936. \nThe Battle of Romanovka happened in June 1919 during a big fight in Russia. Some Russian leaders, led by Yakov Triapitsyn, tried to surprise an American army camp in a place called Romanovka, close to Vladivostok. But the American soldiers were able to stop them. This was the last main fight between the American and Russian groups in the Russian Civil War. After this, there were smaller fights, mostly won by the Americans, involving the Bolsheviks and Cossacks. \nThe Kerensky-Krasnov uprising was when Alexander Kerensky, a leader, tried to come back in charge after the Bolsheviks removed his government in Petrograd."}], "output": "\nThe Russian Civil War ended in 1922 when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, formed the Soviet Union.**"},

It was made up of two types: long-haired (Rough) and short-haired (Smooth). This breed came from different herding dogs that were around a long time ago, like dogs from the Roman times, local Celtic dogs, Viking Spitzes, and even Gordon and Irish Setters.\nThe Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a type of American hunting terrier. It's smaller and stronger than the American Rat Terrier, with shorter legs and heavier bones. It comes from different dogs like Rat Terriers, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terriers that early English and other workers brought over. Since it was mainly a farm, hunting, and work dog, there wasn't much planned breeding. It has traits from other dogs like Feists, Bull Terriers, and Beagles.\n\nThese early terriers were mixed with Beagle or Beagle-like dogs for better scenting. This breeding created a dog with a great sense of smell, high intelligence, and a strong desire to work with its owner. Even though they can be a bit distant with strangers, they are loyal and always want to be by their owner's side. \nA Feist is a small dog that comes from a group of terriers brought to the US by workers from England. These dogs were originally used to catch rats because their owners liked to bet on them. Over time, they mixed with other dogs like Smooth Fox Terriers, Manchester Terriers, and even an old type called English White Terrier. They were not just rat catchers but also got faster with Whippets and Italian Greyhounds, and better at hunting with Beagles. This made the Feist a dog with many purposes, not just for rat catching. \nExplanation: The English Setter is a medium-sized dog from the Setter family. This family includes other setters like red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The dog has a white body with long, soft hair around the legs, under its belly, and on its tail. The coat has little spots of different colors, and these different colors are called belton. \n\n Simplified: The English Setter is a medium-sized dog with a white coat, long hair on their legs, belly, and tail. Their coat has some colored patches, and these patches are called belton. \nThe Russian Toy Dog, also called the Russkiy Toy or Toychik, comes from the English Toy Terrier, which is now called the Manchester Terrier. It's a tiny dog breed originally from Russia. There are two types: one with a smooth coat and another with a long coat, previously known as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier. In 1988, they combined both into one breed, 'Russian Toy Terrier'. In 2006, the 'Terrier' part was dropped and the breed was recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. The American Kennel Club started recognizing it in 2008, and it can compete in companion events since 2010. They made the first official standard for the two types in 1966 in Russia. \nThe viol, also called a viola da gamba or gamba, is a type of musical instrument with a wooden body, strings, and a pegbox. You can change the pitch by adjusting the tightness of the strings. There are little strips called frets on the neck that help you play notes more clearly and sound better. Viols first appeared in Spain a long time ago, during the Renaissance and Baroque times (around 1500-1750). They come from older instruments like the rebab from阿拉伯 and the vielle from Europe. They are related to the Venetian viole and the Spanish vihuela, which were similar to a lute but not exactly the same as the guitar. \nA collie is a special kind of herding dog that comes from Scotland and Northern England. They are medium-sized dogs with a pointed snout and often have a white mark on their shoulders. They are very active, good at running and can easily follow animals. Collies have become popular all over the world, including Australia and North America, where they've changed into many different types. Some are still used for working, like herding animals, while others are kept as pets, show dogs, or for fun dog activities like agility and sports. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes collies as a type, but there are differences between dogs used for shows and those trained for herding competitions. They are known for their intelligence, agility, and ability to learn quickly."}], "output": "\nThe Scotch Collie's ancestors include Gordon and Irish Setters.**"},

It was between Ethiopia and Italy, close to a place called Adwa in Ethiopia, in a region called Tigray. This important battle, part of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a big win for Ethiopia and made them keep their independence. \nGiuseppe Arimondi was an Italian general who lived from 1846 to 1896. He is known for winning a battle against the Mahdists, a group of fighters, before other Europeans did in 1893. This victory happened at a place called Agordat. He worked in colonial areas and died in a battle in Adwa. Later, he was honored with the Gold Medal of Military Valor.\nThe First Italo-Ethiopian War happened in 1895-1896 between Italy and Ethiopia. It started because Italy thought a treaty made Ethiopia an Italian protectorate. Italy had friends in Germany and Austria who helped. But, they found the Ethiopian leader, Menelik II, was actually working with them, not against them. So, when the Italian army tried to invade from Italian Eritrea, they faced a stronger Ethiopia. Russia, a Christian country, also helped Ethiopia by giving advice, training, and selling weapons. Other countries, like the UK and France, supported Ethiopia to stop Italy from becoming a big colonial power. The war started in 1895, and the Italians won at first. But, Ethiopia fought back and won at a big battle called the Battle of Adwa. This made the Italians give up and go back to Eritrea. \nEthiopia and Japan have a special relationship because both countries have a long history of successfully fighting against big European countries that wanted to control them. They saw themselves as friends before World War II because they had similar experiences of standing up to power. The Battle of Adwa is about Ethiopia and the Battle of Tsushima is about Japan, both of which were important moments in their history. \nEthiopia is a country in Africa that's surrounded by other countries like Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, and Djibouti. It's one of the oldest countries in the world and has a lot of history. People believe that Ethiopia was where humans first left for other places. The country has a long history that starts with Emperor Menelik I around 1000 BC. Ethiopia has been a continuous state since the Aksumite Empire in the 4th century. In the past, the country had some division, but it was united again in 1855. Ethiopia expanded its borders during the 19th century and was able to keep Italy from controlling it in 1896. It was controlled by Italy from 1936 to 1941 and was later freed by British and Ethiopian forces. \nSaint Ephigenia, also known as Iphigenia of Ethiopia, is a special person from a long time ago who became a Christian. She was told by a very important Christian man named St. Matthew to be close to God. St. Matthew was trying to share the Christian teachings with a place called Ethiopia, which might have been in a place near the Caspian Sea, either in places like Assyria or Babylon or in Armenia. \nHerbert S. Lewis, born in 1934, is a retired anthropology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He taught there from 1963 to 1998. He has done a lot of field research, especially in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, he studied the history of the Oromo people's kingdom called Jimma Abba Jifar and the lives of the Oromos from two different periods, 1958-60 and 1965-66. Some of his pictures from these research are available in the university's Digital Library. His work in Ethiopia focused on political leadership, community organization, ethnohistory, and understanding the culture's past. His main book, A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia, 1830-1932, is about the monarchy's structure, the ruler's power, and its beginnings. In 1965-66, he studied how spirit mediums, called k'allu, who were leaders in religious and conflict resolution, also provided some political guidance in rural areas. \nP'ent'ay is a term in Amharic and Tigrinya used to describe Christians who follow Protestant denominations, especially those who practice Pentecostal beliefs. It started being used in the 1960s as a way to criticize churches with Pentecostal experiences. Now, it's used for any Protestant Ethiopian or Eritrean who is not part of the Orthodox Tewahedo or Eritrean Orthodox churches.\n\nThe word P'ent'ay comes from Pentecostal, but it's often used to refer to all Protestant Christians, regardless of their specific beliefs. Some Orthodox people might also use it for the Catholic minority in Ethiopia. In other languages, this group might be called Evangelicals. The main Protestant denominations in Ethiopia are the Kale Heywet (Word of Life), Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran, Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel), and Meserete Kristos (Christ Foundation or Mennonite).\n\nThere are some P'ent'ay communities, especially those associated with Mekane Yesus, that have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which is the mainstream Ethiopian Christian tradition. However, most P'ent'ay churches are quite Pentecostal in their worship and beliefs."}], "output": "\nThe Battle of Adwa secured Ethiopia's independence from Italy.**"},

It's quite common in many areas where it grows, and can be found in various habitats.\n\nThe plant is a perennial herb, often looking like a mat or can be upright, with stems between a few centimeters to half a meter long. It's usually covered in hair, especially on the upper parts. The leaves are shaped like lances, arranged opposite each other, and can be a few centimeters long. Sometimes, flowers appear in a cluster at the top of the stem or in the leaf stems.\n\nEach flower is protected by a hairy, sepal-covered cup. The petals are white and have two points. The plant is unique because it's dioecious, meaning it has male and female plants that look the same but have different parts for reproduction. The male plant has full stamens, while the female plant's stamens are reduced. \nSuksdorf's silene, also known as Suksdorf's catchfly or Cascade alpine campion, is a type of flowering plant in the pink family. It grows in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, from Washington and Idaho to northern California, typically on high mountain slopes and forested areas below the tree line. This plant is short and thick, with several stems coming from a woody base, and has a clumpy appearance.\n\nEach stem can reach heights of 10 to 15 centimeters and has a fuzzy texture, with sticky areas on the upper parts. The leaves are gathered around the base, soft, and covered in fine hairs. solitary flowers appear on stems and are protected by a purple, veined calyx that also has purple hairs. The petals are white or have a purple tint, with two lobes at the ends and small appendages at the base."}], "output": "\nYes, both Ferocactus and Silene are types of plants. Ferocactus is a cactus, specifically a type of big, round cactus, while Silene is a large plant group, also known as Caryophyllaceae, which includes various flowering plants like the white campion (Silene latifolia) and other species mentioned in the passage."},

It started in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps and has flown different planes like fighters, bombers, and for watching and warning (AEW&C). During World War 1, they flew in France to protect and attack. After the war, it was short-lived and then formed again in 1937. They were bombers in World War II and used Canberra jets in the Malayan Emergency and Vietnam. In 1982, they stopped, but in 2000, they returned with Boeing 737s for AEW&C missions. In 2014, one plane was sent to help fight ISIS in the Middle East. \nThe English Electric Canberra is a British plane made in the 1950s. It was made to replace an older plane called the de Havilland Mosquito. It needed to be good at flying high and dropping bombs from high up, and it used new jet technology to do this. The RAF, the British air force, started using it in 1951 and it was the first jet plane they had for bombing.\nDuring World War II, the South West Pacific was a big part of the fighting between the Allies and Japan. It involved places like the Philippines, parts of the Dutch East Indies (except for one island), Borneo, Australia, and its area called New Guinea (which includes a group of islands). The Allies controlled this area through their South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command. In World War II, from 1941 to 1945, the United States had two main areas in the Pacific where they fought. These were called the Pacific Ocean Areas (POA). There were three parts: Central Pacific, North Pacific, and South Pacific, which were led by Admiral Chester Nimitz. Another area, called the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), was commanded by General Douglas MacArthur. In 1945, they added a new group, the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, led by General Carl Spaatz. \nThe SM.79 Sparviero was an Italian plane with three engines. It was made of wood and metal and was meant to be a fast passenger plane. From 1937 to 1939, it broke 26 world speed records, making it the fastest medium bomber for a while. During the Spanish Civil War and World War II, it flew everywhere Italy fought. It worked well as a torpedo bomber in the Mediterranean and became famous. It had a special hump on its fuselage that pilots called the damned hunchback. \nExplanation: The South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was a special group of powerful leaders during World War II. It was part of the big Allied teams in the Pacific Ocean. SWPA was in charge of a big area that had the Philippines, Borneo, parts of Indonesia, East Timor, Australia, Papua and New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands on the west. The main groups in SWPA were from the United States and Australia, but other countries like the Netherlands, Philippines, and the British also joined in. \nExplanation: The Tupolev Tu-12, previously known as Tu-77, was a special plane made in the Soviet Union. It was made to test how jet engines work in a big plane, after World War II. It was created to help Tupolev and their air force understand the challenges of using a jet-powered bomber. \n\nRewritten: The Tupolev Tu-12, or Tu-77, was a test jet bomber made in Russia after the war. It was made to learn about using jet engines in a bigger plane, and it was part of their practice before fully switching to jet technology. \nNo. 12 Squadron was a part of the Royal Australian Air Force. It started in 1939 and during World War II, they flew missions in the South West Pacific. From 1941 to 1943, they mainly checked the waters near Australia. From November 1943 to July 1944, they were at Merauke in New Guinea. In 1945, they changed to being a heavy bomber until the war ended. Then, they became No. 1 Squadron again in 1948.

When someone arrives in Australia without a visa by boat, they won't be allowed to live in Australia. Instead, if they are found to be a real refugee, they will be sent to live in Papua New Guinea. Before they can move there, they will stay in a big Australian immigration center on Manus Island to be checked. If their refugee status is not real, they might be sent back to their home country, sent to a different country, or kept in the center forever. This policy started in 2013 because more people were coming to Australia by boat. Some people, like Tony Abbott, supported it, but others, like Christine Milne and human rights groups, didn't like it and had protests in big cities. \nCotter High School in Winona, Minnesota, is the only Catholic school in the area. It started as Cotter School for Boys in 1911 and was run by Christian Brothers. In 1952, it became co-educational with Cathedral Girls High School, and a new Cotter building was built in 1953.

Unfortunately, it caught fire in 1924 and had to move to City Hall, Post Office, and churches for classes until a new one was built. The new school, which measured 350 feet long and 100 feet wide, opened in 1926 with rooms for 20 classrooms, a 1,100-seat auditorium, a library, science labs, a gym, and more. It's still in use today, with some updates made over the years. \nThe Concho Indian Boarding School, or sometimes called the Cheyenne-Arapaho Boarding School, was a school for Native American kids, especially those from the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes. Later, it welcomed other Native students too. It was open from 1909 to 1983. The school was in a place called Concho, Oklahoma, not too far from two other towns, El Reno and Concho. The name Concho comes from a Spanish word for shell, because the school's leader, Charles E. Shell, was involved with the area. \nGrace Church School is a private school in New York City, in the East Village area of Manhattan. It was started by Grace Church in 1894 as the first school in the city to teach music to boarding students. In 1934, they started a day school.

It has about 40 different species, and most of them are from Europe, Asia, and Africa. However, there are two in Australia, specifically in the southeastern part. These plants can be either annuals or perennials, reaching heights of 5-50 centimeters, and their leaves are opposite. \nCypress is a type of tree or bush that grows in cold places. It's part of a family called Cupressaceae. The word cypress comes from a French word that was originally from Latin, and Latin got it from a Greek word that meant kypharissos.\nFokienia is a type of conifer tree, like cypress, but it's in between two other tree genera, Chamaecyparis and Calocedrus. Genetically, it's more like Chamaecyparis. Some people don't think it's a separate genus. There's only one living species called Fokienia hodginsii, also known as the Fujian cypress, and one old tree species, Fokienia ravenscragensis, that's extinct. \nThe Frenchman Formation is a rock layer from a time called the Late Cretaceous, around the Maastrichtian period. It can be found in two places, near the Frenchman River in southern Saskatchewan and the Cypress Hills in Alberta, south of there. In 1942, a person named G.M. Furnival studied these rocks and decided it was its own type based on what he saw in those areas. This formation has dinosaur genera that are very young, similar to the Hell Creek Formation in the United States. \nThe Cupressus genus is a group of cypress trees, part of the Cupressaceae family. It's not a perfect group because it includes others with the same name. Scientists look at their genetic and shape traits and say they belong in the Cupressoideae subfamily. People call them cypress because it comes from two languages - Old French and Latin, both derived from a Greek word meaning  Cypress tree. \nCedrol is a type of alcohol found in the special smell of trees, like cedar and juniper. It can also be found in a plant called Origanum onites. People use it to make other smells. In Texas, it's about 19% of the cedar smell, and in Virginia, it's about 15.8%. \nLibocedrus is a type of coniferous tree, about five in number, found in two places, New Zealand and New Caledonia. It is similar to other tree genera from South America and New Guinea. Some botanists group it with Pilgerodendron, Austrocedrus, and Papuacedrus. However, these relationships are not as close as previously thought. There's a tree called Calocedrus in the Northern Hemisphere that was once considered part of Libocedrus, but they're not really related. The name 'Libocedrus' comes from the teardrop-shaped resin drops it produces. \nPilgerodendron is a special kind of tree, called a conifer, that belongs to a group called Cupressaceae, which are like cypress trees. There's only one tree in this group called Pilgerodendron uviferum, and it can only be found in very special forests in two countries, Chile and Argentina, near the bottom of the Earth. These forests are called Valdivian and Magellanic subpolar forests. This tree grows in a place called Tierra del Fuego, which is the southernmost part of the world where conifers grow. It's also part of a group of trees from the southern part of the world, called Callitroideae, that are friends with the plants found in Antarctica."}], "output": "\nNo, both Cypress and Ajuga are not genera.

They picked a big player named Alonzo Mourning from Georgetown with the second choice in the draft. With Mourning, Larry Johnson (a good player), and Muggsy Bogues, they didn't do very well most of the time, but they improved towards the end and finished with 44 wins and 38 losses. This helped them finish third in their division and get into the playoffs for the first time. Mourning was a key player, hitting a game-winning shot in the first round, but they lost to the New York Knicks in the next round. This made them the first of the four new teams from the late 1980s to win a playoff series. \nTyrone Bogues, born on January 9, 1965, was a basketball player from America who stood only 5 feet tall. He played as a point guard in the NBA for 14 seasons, even though he was the shortest player in the league's history.

They were created as a new team in Charlotte, North Carolina. At their first big event, called the NBA Expansion Draft, they got players who didn't have a team yet. Then, five days later, they picked players from college in the NBA draft. The Hornets stayed in Charlotte for 14 years before moving to New Orleans in 2002. After they left, there was a new team called the Charlotte Bobcats in 2004. They picked their players in a draft too, two days after the Bobcats' big event. In 2014, the team changed its name back to the Hornets, and they took the history and records from the old Charlotte Hornets. \nAyana D'Nay Walker, born September 10, 1979, used to play basketball as a woman for the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters from 1998 to 2002. She did really well, winning a gold medal with the USA Women's National Team in 2001 and setting a record with 19 rebounds in a gold medal game. She also won a gold medal with the USA World University Games Team in the same year. In 2002, she was picked 20th by the Detroit Shock in the WNBA draft and later won a championship with them. In 2005, she joined the Charlotte Sting, but when the team stopped, she was chosen again by the Los Angeles Sparks in the dispersal draft. She finished her career with the Shock in 2007. \nThe 2003 WNBA Season was the seventh one for women's basketball. It was special because some teams either left or changed their names. The Orlando Miracle moved to Connecticut and became the Connecticut Sun, while the Utah Starzz went to San Antonio and became the Silver Stars. The Miami Sol and Portland Fire didn't continue, and the Charlotte Sting was the only team without an NBA team. The games also increased from 32 to 34 per team. The season ended with the Detroit Shock winning their first championship. \nThe Charlotte Hornets are a basketball team in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Then, in 2004, a new team called the Charlotte Bobcats started. In 2014, they changed their name back to Hornets.

She started acting in TV shows during the early 1980s and is well-known for her work in that field. \nBobbi Bacha is a private investigator from Texas, played by Sela Ward in a 2004 Sony Pictures movie called Suburban Madness. In the movie, she works on a real-life case involving a wealthy man named Robert Durst from New York, who was accused of killing his neighbor Morris Black in Galveston, Texas. However, Durst was found not guilty by the jury in that case.\nBarend is a Dutch name, mostly used as a first name for boys and sometimes as a middle name. In 2014, there were over 4,000 boys in the Netherlands with Barend as their first name and around 3,000 with it as their middle name. The name might have come from Bernard. Some famous people with this name include: \n\n1. Barend van de Kerkhove (a possible historical figure or modern-day individual)\n2.

It was shown on CBS on October 3, 2004. \nIn Latvia, names are like in other European countries, made up of two parts: the 'given name' and the 'family name'. During a time when the Soviet Union controlled the country (1940-1991), they didn't like people having middle names, but after Latvia became independent again in 1991, rules changed. Now, it's allowed to have up to two given names, and giving a middle name to kids is more common. \nThe name Singh comes from India and has a special meaning. It started as a title for warriors who were very brave, and a famous leader named Guru Gobind Singh made everyone who follows Sikhism use it. Now, people of different groups and religions use it as a title, not just as a last name, and it can be found in many parts of India and among people who have moved away. \nJeff Strabone is a man from Brooklyn, America, who does many things.

He lived in St. Augustine and had a job to talk to the people living south of there and in Cape Canaveral. Because of this, he made friends with the Ais tribe. \nThe Native people in Florida have lived in the area for over 12,000 years before Europeans came. But by the early 1800s, most of them were gone. Some went to Louisiana and their family still lives there. The Spanish took some to Cuba and Mexico in the 1800s. A few might have joined the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes.\nThe Australian Embassy in London is a place where Australia's government talks to the United Kingdom. It's in a special building called Australia House, which is very important and has been used for diplomatic work for a very long time. It's also the first embassy Australia had and has been operating the longest. \nA diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from a country or organization that goes to another country to represent their home country officially. When we talk about a diplomatic mission, we usually mean the embassy, which is the main office in the capital city of the receiving country. Embassies are the homes of diplomats. However, there are also smaller missions called consulates, not in the capital. These missions can be either in the country they represent or in other countries too, but they're not always in the capital. So, we have two types: resident embassies and non-resident embassies. \nA diplomatic bag, often called a diplomatic pouch, is a special container used by diplomats to carry important documents or items between their mission and their home country or other official places. It can come in different shapes like a box, briefcase, or even a large suitcase, and it has a lock or seal to keep it secure from non-authorized people. This bag is protected by law and can't be searched or seized without permission, as stated in a rule called article 27. It can only hold items meant for official use, and the person who carries it, called a diplomatic courier, is also immune from getting arrested. \nThe Chinese Embassy in London is a place where China's government in the UK does important work. It's the main embassy in the UK, and there are also smaller ones in Edinburgh and Manchester. It started as the Chinese Legation in 1877, which was the first official place in the UK for China to communicate. It has been representing China through different governments, like the Qing Empire, the Republic, and now the People's Republic. This embassy was where a significant event in Chinese history happened, when they kept Sun Yat-sen, a key figure in the 1911 revolution. It still hosts events for China-UK relations, like the big celebrations in 2012 for 40 years of friendship. \nThe US Embassy in Kenya, located in Nairobi, is where the US government represents the United States in Kenya. It started in 1964 when the US started diplomatic relations with the country. In 1998, a terrorist attack hit the original embassy, so they built a new one in Gigiri, a nearby area, in 2003. The embassy in Somalia is also based there. \nAzerbaijan started building diplomatic relations with other countries in the 16th century when it was part of the Safavids dynasty. However, it officially established its first diplomatic body, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 1918 after becoming a republic. When Mehmet Hasan Hacınkski became the first minister, the parliament sent a delegation to the Ottoman State to sign the first international agreement, recognizing Azerbaijan's independence. They also signed a friendship treaty with Iran.\n\nDuring this period, Azerbaijan established a consulate in Tehran and other cities. However, their diplomatic efforts were temporarily halted when the Russian army entered Baku in 1920. After gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan started rebuilding its diplomatic relations and established embassies and consulates in over 70 countries.

He was born on November 7, 1910, and passed away on January 6, 1989. \nAlfred Gell was a British social anthropologist known for his work on art, language, symbols, and rituals. He studied with famous scholars Edmund Leach and Raymond Firth and did research in Melanesia and India. Gell taught at the London School of Economics and was a Fellow of the British Academy. He passed away from cancer in 1997 at the age of 51.\nThomas Eriksen, born on February 6, 1962, is a Norwegian anthropologist. He teaches at the University of Oslo and is the president of the European Association of Social Anthropologists from 2015-2016. He's also part of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. \n\nExplanation: Simplified the passage by removing technical terms and providing clearer details about his profession and roles. \nSocial Anthropology/Anthropologie Sociale is a magazine that comes out every three months. It started in 2007 and is made by Wiley-Blackwell for a group in Europe called the European Association of Social Anthropologists. Before that, it was published by Cambridge University Press. The people in charge of deciding what articles to put in are Sarah Green and Patrick Laviolette. The articles can be written in English or French. \nExplanation: Network Analysis and Ethnographic Challenges: Understanding a Turkish Nomad Clan is a book written by Douglas R. White from the University of California, Irvine, and Ulla Johansen from the University of Cologne. It combines anthropology and complexity science. This book is very important because it helps us learn about Central Asia's culture and politics. \n\n Simplified: A book about a Turkish family's lifestyle is written by two professors.

He wrote many books and articles about anthropology, looking at it from how people trade with each other and compare different cultures. He teaches at two universities in Serbia, one in Belgrade and another in Montenegro. Since 2017, he also leads a research group at a big institute in Belgrade. He used to teach at other universities in different countries too, like Scotland, Serbia, Brazil, South Africa, and Slovenia. In 2016, he was chosen to be in charge of a book series for a European group of anthropologists. He works with Han Vermeulen to organize a group that studies the history of anthropology. \nExplanation: \n\nParticipant observation is a method used in research to gather information. It's commonly used in fields like anthropology and ethnology, but not as much in sociology, communication, geography, or psychology. The goal is to deeply understand a specific group or community, like their customs or a religious community, by spending a long time with them and observing their daily life. This method started with social anthropologists, like Bronisław Malinowski, who studied people in their natural environment in places like Britain. Some other influential figures, like Franz Boas in the US, also used this approach. \nMuted Group Theory (MGT) is a concept made by social anthropologists Edwin and Shirley Ardener in 1975. It talks about how a main group, called the dominant group, creates the rules and words for a language. People in a smaller group, called the subordinate group, have to learn and use this dominant language to express themselves. But, sometimes they may not express their thoughts clearly because of language problems. The dominant group might not listen to the smaller group either. This can make the smaller group feel unheard or muted. MGT was first made to understand how women and men are treated differently, but it can apply to any group that is quieted by their language's limitations."}], "output": "\nSocial Anthropology.**"},

Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional? \n\n Passage: \nIn 1981, a big group of important people in the United States, called the Supreme Court, decided that it was okay for only men to have to sign up for a special program called the draft. This decision was made after many talks and discussions in the government. Before, the law said the same thing for men only. Some lawyers, like Robert L. Goldberg, didn't agree with this and tried to say it was not fair. But the Supreme Court, with a vote of 6-3, said that the law was not against fairness, and it would stay as it was. \nIn the United States, the government has used something called the draft, which is like a requirement for young men to join the army, during four big fights: Civil War, World War 1, World War 2, and a long cold one. The draft started again in 1940 for the first time during peace, and it lasted until 1973. This means that, except for when everyone自愿报名， young men were chosen to join the army during these times. But now, the army only takes volunteers, and they have a system called Selective Service to be ready if they need more people again in the future. Even though the draft is not used now, all young men between 18 and 25 still need to register with this system.\nOn May 9, 2010, in Kiev, there was a big event called the Victory Day Parade to celebrate the 65th anniversary of how the Soviet Union won a big war.

There were 17 music groups, led by Major General Volodymyr Derkach, who is in charge of army music. \nThe Indian armed forces and veterans have been asking for something called One Rank One Pension (OROP) for a long time. This means that when someone reaches the same rank and has the same amount of time serving, they should get the same pension, no matter when they retire.

It was made by Ray Enright and stars Sterling Hayden. The movie was filmed in a place called Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, Arizona, and another place called Montezuma Castle National Monument. The people who lived nearby, called Yavapai Indians, didn't want to be in the movie because it was about a place where people used to live. So, they didn't work. To fix this, the filmmakers found Navajos from a faraway place, 137 miles away, to take their place. \nMontezuma Castle National Monument protects old homes in Arizona that were made by the Sinagua people, who were friends with the Hohokam. These homes are from around 1100 to 1425 AD. The main building has five floors and twenty rooms, and it took three long years to build.\nChâteau de Druyes is a castle in Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines, Yonne, France. It was made in the 1200s by people called the Counts of Nevers. They owned it until the 1800s. It was a special home for important people, like Peter II, who was the Emperor of Constantinople, and his daughter Matilda, who was a Countess. They both lived there often. \nHeaven, or Shamayim in Hebrew, is one part of the three-part world: Shamayim is where God and other gods live, Earth (Eretz) is where people live and are alive, and Sheol is where the dead, including the good ones, go. \nIn Norse mythology, Andlang is a place mentioned as the second sky realm, located between the first one with gods' halls and the third, called Vídbláin. There are nine heavens in total, as told by Snorri. After a big event called Ragnarök, Andlang will be a place where dead souls will stay and rest. \nThe Tabernacle, or mishkan, was a special tent made of curtains and wood, designed to be God's home while the Israelites were traveling in the desert and later when they conquered a land. It had gold decorations and was shown to Moses at Mount Sinai, with specific instructions. They carried it with them and later, a bigger temple called Solomon's Temple replaced it as the place where God lived. \nIn simple terms, an inquiline is an animal that lives in the home or space of another animal, like a guest. This can happen with insects that live in the tunnels of gophers or ants and termites that share their nests with many different species. Inquiline animals don't harm the host species, while parasites do. They are similar but not exactly the same thing. \nExplanation: In Norse stories, Víðbláinn is the third sky in a place called Gylfaginning, made by Snorri. It's way up above two other places, Andlang and Asgard. After a big event called Ragnarök, this sky will be a home for the souls of people who have passed away."}], "output": "\nThe dwelling place of the dead, as mentioned in the passage, was built between 1100 to 1425 AD for the Sinagua people in Arizona.

The Beatles even wanted to use a video of the band doing the song for their movie Magical Mystery Tour, but it didn't end up in the final version. Now, you can watch it on a special DVD or Blu-ray for the movie from 2012. \nMichael Finnegan, sometimes spelled as Michael Finnagen or Michael Vinnegan, is a very long song that can go on and on without ending. It's usually sung by kids in school and is popular at campfires and other events. We don't know who wrote the words or music, but it sounds similar to Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush.

It's made with two things, Picric acid and either Dinitrophenol or Hexanitrodiphenylamine, mixed together in a 70/30 ratio. It was used a long time ago, in the early 20th century, to fill some special shells used by the Royal Navy to break through things. \nPicric acid is a type of organic substance with the name 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) or (ON)CHOH. It's called picric because it has a bitter taste, similar to the Greek word pikros. It's very acidic and can be explosive, which was its main use in the past. However, it has also been used in things like medicine for treating burns and making dyes.\nIsopropyl alcohol, also known as propan-2-ol, is a clear liquid with a strong smell. It has the chemical formula CHOH or CHO and is sometimes called dimethyl carbinol or i-PrOH, but it's a mistake to call it that. It's a simple type of alcohol where a propyl group is attached to a hydroxyl group, making it a secondary alcohol with one carbon attached to two others. It's similar to 1-propanol but has different structure. It's widely used in various things like cleaning products, disinfectants, and antiseptics. \nAlcohol is a type of chemical that has a -OH group, or hydroxyl, connected to a carbon atom. It can be part of bigger groups with other carbon or hydrogen atoms. A simple type of alcohol has a simple shape with only one chain and is called a cyclic alcohol, with the general formula CHOH. Ethanol, which is also called alcohol, is the type found in drinks like beer and wine. When we talk about alcohol, we usually mean ethanol. Things about alcohol can be found in articles that talk about it. \nTHPC, or Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride, is a special kind of chemical made from phosphorus and chlorine. It has the name [P(CHOH)]Cl because it has a part called P(CHOH) that is connected to four other parts, which is common for phosphorus salts. People use it to create materials that help stop fires. \n1-Hexanol is a clear liquid with 6 carbon atoms in its structure, like this: CH(CH)OH. It's not very soluble in water, but it can mix with things like diethyl ether and ethanol. There are two other similar liquids called 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, which are different because the water part (hydroxyl) is in a different place. Many other liquids with the same formula, CHOH, exist too. It's used to make perfumes. \n1-Pentanol, also known as n-pentanol or pentan-1-ol, is a type of alcohol that has 5 carbon atoms. Its chemical formula is CHOH. It's a colorless liquid that smells bad. It's the simple form of a bigger alcohol called amyl alcohol, which exists in 8 different versions with the same formula. \nAldonic acids are sugar acids created when a sugar, called an aldose, loses an aldehyde group and gets a carboxylic acid group instead. They have a simple structure: HOOC-(CHOH)-CHOH. If only the end part with a hydroxyl group (OH) is changed, it makes uronic acids, but if both ends are changed, it forms aldaric acids."}], "output": "\nThe component of shellite with the formula (ON)CHOH is Picric acid.**"},

They claim there's a debate about evolution, but many scientific organizations, including the Royal Society in the UK and many Academies of Science globally, disagree. The group is connected to the Discovery Institute, which is the main place for intelligent design ideas. \nExplanation: The Discovery Institute (DI) is a group in Seattle that supports conservative ideas. They are famous for talking about intelligent design, which is not really science. They want schools in the US to teach both this idea and ideas about evolution, even though most scientists agree evolution is true. Their goal is to make people think there's a debate about these topics in science classes.Every Voice is a group that supports making US politics more equal. They formed in 2014 and join with others to help with campaign financing. They want politicians to get money from the government instead of too much from special people and try to limit the amount people can give to them.

The band changed a few times and played with bigger bands like Slayer and D.R.I. They decided to try and get noticed by people outside Italy, so they sent their demos to international music critics and even went to New York City to perform. This paid off and they got a record deal in 1991. Their album, Tension at the Seams, was well-received and got them to play with famous bands like Vasco Rossi and Metallica. The album had a unique cover and a popular music video. \nThe Truth campaign is a group in the US that wants to stop kids from smoking. It's made by the American Legacy Foundation, which is a group that cares about people's health. They started it in 1999 with help from some tobacco companies.

It was supposed to come out on June 4, 2012. In the US, people could hear it on rock radio since then, but in the UK, it's not out yet. This is because the singer, Ian Watkins, went to jail in 2013.

It was made by a famous architect named Sir Edwin Lutyens and is in Exeter, a city in the south-west of England.

At first, they wanted to build a special area at the cathedral for the war dead, but they couldn't do it because they didn't have enough money. They decided to make a War Cross instead. They found the perfect place for it on the cathedral green. There was also a separate memorial being planned for Exeter, but the groups in charge didn't talk to each other, so both the cathedral's memorial and the one in Northernhay Gardens were built. \nThe Manchester Cenotaph is a big memorial in Manchester, England, that honors people from the First World War.

Some wanted a useful thing, not just a big statue. After a meeting, they decided on a statue. Lutyens was chosen to design it, and he also worked on a similar one for the North Eastern Railway.\n\nBut, there were problems. Some people didn't like the designs because they didn't look good with the old buildings in the city and the railway memorial was too big. They asked for a change, so the group moved the memorial to a new place outside the city walls.

He was a son of Domhnall, the leader of a group called Clann Domhnaill, which was a part of a bigger group called Clann Somhairle. Aonghus took over his father's role in the middle of the 13th century. At that time, the leaders of the Islands didn't really listen to the Scottish King and only showed respect to the Norwegian King far away. Aonghus first showed up in records because he helped the Irish people who were facing problems with English rule in the northwest. They did this because they wanted friends from other places, like Clann Domhnaill, to help them fight against the Scottish who were trying to grow their power. \nThe Kingdom of the Isles was a group of islands in Scotland during 9th to 13th centuries. These islands were called Suðreyjar or Southern Isles by the Norse, different from the Norðreyjar in Orkney and Shetland. We don't have all the information, and the kingdom wasn't always united. The place is sometimes called the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, but not all rulers used that name. They could be independent but often had leaders in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland, or Orkney.

This lamp is brighter, producing 6 to 10 candles, compared to older ones. The reason it shines so well is that it uses oil and wick better, so the wick doesn't need to be trimmed as often. \nThe Lewis lamp is a special light for lighthouses. It was made by a man named Winslow Lewis and he got a special permission for it in 1810. The main thing people liked about it was that it used much less oil than other lamps. It looked a bit like an Argand lamp, which also had a curved reflector, but had a special lens made from green glass in front. Aimé Argand, who also made an Argand lamp, made a similar one with a reflector. Even though the Argand lamp became popular in Europe, the US chose the Lewis lamp for their lighthouses.\nA hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is a special type of cold cathode lamp used for checking the colors of light in labs (like for looking at tiny atoms) and for tuning the frequency of light sources like lasers. It works better because it has a hollow space inside that helps it need less voltage and more power to work. \nHere's a simplified version of the paragraph: \n\nAntoine Quinquet was a French pharmacist born in Soissons in 1745. In 1760, he started learning from an apothecary in the same city. In 1777, he went to Paris and worked for Antoine Baumé. Later, he went to Geneva, where he met Aimé Argand. In 1779, he came back to Paris and started his own pharmacy there. \nA kerosene lamp, often called a paraffin lamp, is a simple light that uses kerosene as fuel. It has a wick or a mantle to produce light, protected by a glass chimney. You can place it on a table or carry it with a hand-held lantern. These lamps are great for places without electricity, like villages without power or during power outages. There are three types: flat wick, central draught with a tubular wick, and mantle lamps. Kerosene lanterns for portability have a flat wick and come in three types: dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast. \nA glow switch starter is a special kind of starter for fluorescent lights. It has neon or argon gas inside and has two parts that move when electricity flows. When it's turned on, the gas gets hot and makes one part move closer to a stationary part. This causes the starter to touch the light's electrodes, making the light turn on. But when the light is old, the starter keeps blinking until it breaks or the light's electrode burns out. \nThe qulliq is a special lamp that Arctic people, like the Inuit, Chukchi, and Yupik, use. It's made of seal oil, blubber, or soapstone and is called 'kudlik' in Inuktitut. \nExplanation: A trouble light, also called a rough service light, is a special lamp designed to brighten up hard-to-reach areas and can withstand some wear. It has a bulb inside a strong, protective cage with a handle that joins both. The handle can even have a built-in electrical outlet, making it a dual-purpose tool with a long cord for reaching far. \n\n Simplified: This is a light with a strong cage around the bulb and a handle. It's tough and can reach from far, and it has a socket on the handle so it can work as both a light and an extension cord."}], "output": "\nAimé Argand's lamp.**"},

It's called a nothogenus. People in gardening use Lc. as a short way to talk about it. \nExplanation: Broughtonia is a type of orchid, which are flowers, that grow in places like the Bahamas and parts of bigger islands called the Greater Antilles. In trade journals, people use Bro to refer to this genus. \n\nRevised: Broughtonia is a genus of orchids found in the Bahamas and Greater Antilles. It's often written as Bro in gardening books or trade publications.\nBlood Red Broughtonia, a plant called Broughtonia sanguinea, belongs to a group of plants called Broughtonia within the Orchidaceae family. In trade journals, the genus is simply referred to as Bro. \nWilliam Nicholls, born on July 23, 1885 and passed away on March 10, 1951, was an Australian botanist who loved orchids. He was really good at taking photos and painting them. He wrote many articles about orchids for a magazine called The Victorian Naturalist, and he even discovered new ones. He wanted to create a big book with pictures of all Australian orchids, but he didn't finish it before he died. After he died, they combined his work into one book called Orchids of Australia in 1969. Some of the orchid species he found and named include: Caladenia caudata, Caladenia echidnachila, and so on. \nOtaara, often shortened as Otr in gardening, is a special type of orchid that is made by mixing plants from different families. It includes genes from Brassavola, Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia, and Sophronitis. \nDuck orchids, also called Paracaleana, are a type of pretty flowers in the Orchidaceae family. They grow in Australia and New Zealand, but not in the northern part of Australia. They look a bit like Caleana major, but their flowers and the insects that help them reproduce are different. These flowers are not very showy, having just one green leaf and a few not-so-colorful flowers that are hard to notice. They also need male thynnid wasps for pollination, like hammer orchids (Drakaea). \nSpider orchids, also known as Caladenia, are a type of 350 plant species in the Orchidaceae family. They are small, ground-dwelling plants with a single leaf and stem that have a fuzzy texture. The flower's lower part, called the labellum, has edges that look like fringes or have small bumps called calli. These flowers have special features to attract specific insects for pollination.\n\nSpider orchids are grouped into three categories - spider orchids, zebra orchids, and cowslip orchids - but people also use other names. Most of them are native to Australia, and a remarkable 136 species can be found in Western Australia, making it the place with the most spider orchid species. \nCalochilus, also called beard orchids, is a group of about 30 plant species in the Orchidaceae family. These plants are small, growing on land with just one leaf at the base, or no leaves at all. What makes them unique is the hairy lip, which gives them their name. Unlike some other orchids in Australia, beard orchids don't use baby plant parts (daughter tubers) to reproduce. Instead, they self-pollinate when they can't be crossed with other plants. Most of these species are found in Australia, but some can be found in neighboring places like New Zealand, New Guinea, and New Caledonia."}], "output": "\nYes, both Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya are orchids. Laeliocattleya is specifically mentioned as a type of orchid that is a nothogenus, which is created by combining plants from the Laelia and Cattleya families. Broughtonia, on the other hand, is a separate genus within the Orchidaceae family, as mentioned in the passage."},

American and Filipino soldiers fought against Japanese ones in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. It lasted for a whole month and was very sad because many, over 100,000, people died and the city was completely ruined. The Japanese did very bad things to the people, and the buildings and important parts of the city's history were also destroyed. This battle ended Japan's control in the Philippines for three years (1942-1945). General Douglas MacArthur was very happy when Manila was taken back. \nThe Seven Days Battles were a big fight with seven parts that happened from June 25 to July 1, 1862, close to Richmond, Virginia. Confederate leader Robert E. Lee beat the Union Army, led by Gen. George B. McClellan, and made them leave Richmond. They had to go back down the peninsula. Some people call it the Seven Days Campaign, but it was actually the end of a bigger plan called the Peninsula Campaign, not a separate one.\nThe Seven Days Battles during the American Civil War were fought by Confederate Army units and their leaders. We made a list of these units and commanders using information from the army's structure during the battle, the reports of casualties, and separate Union order of battle. \nThe Seven Days Battles during the American Civil War were fought by these Union Army units and their leaders. We got the list of who fought by looking at the army's records of who was there and who got hurt. The Confederacy's units are listed separately. \nOn June 8, 1862, there was a big fight called the Battle of Cross Keys in a place called Rockingham County, Virginia. This fight was part of a plan by a Confederate general named Stonewall Jackson during a time called the American Civil War. The important thing is, after this battle and another one the next day at Port Republic, Stonewall Jackson's plan worked. The Union armies had to go away, and he could use his troops to help another general, Lee, in a big fight near Richmond, Virginia. \nThe Battle of Gaines's Mill, also called First Battle of Cold Harbor or Chickahominy River fight, happened on June 27, 1862, in Virginia. It was part of a series of seven fights during a big event called the Peninsula Campaign in the American Civil War. The day before, there was a fight at Beaver Dam Creek that didn't go well. The Confederates, led by General Robert E. Lee, tried to attack the Union Army's side that was far away on the north side of the Chickahominy River. They had a big group of around 57,000 soldiers in six groups. Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter and his group, called the V Corps, had a strong defense line. The Confederates tried to attack but didn't do it well, causing a lot of hurt to their side. Even when Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's group arrived, they couldn't attack right away because of some delays, so the Union Army got some help from another group, the VI Corps. \nSavage's Station was a special place during the American Civil War where the Army of the Potomac got supplies, had a hospital, and had their main office. It was in Henrico County, Virginia, close to a train line. But, the people who now own the train tracks, the Norfolk Southern Railroad, don't have any records of a station there. They do remember a house near the tracks, which was used as a hospital during a big battle. General George B. McClellan used it as his office too. Sadly, the house was burned by soldiers in 1864 and never rebuilt. There's now nothing left, but a small old cemetery is still near the spot. In the 1930s, there was even a smokehouse there, but it's not there anymore. \nThe Battle of Port Republic took place on June 9, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, during the American Civil War. It was a very important fight between two strong armies. This was the most expensive battle for General Stonewall Jackson's Army of the Valley during their trip through the Shenandoah Valley. The battle and another one at Cross Keys the day before were the final wins for Jackson's campaign. These victories made the Union armies leave and go back, and Jackson could then help General Lee outside Richmond, Virginia, with no problems."}], "output": "\nThe Seven Days Battles were fought earlier in our nation's history, from June 25 to July 1, 1862.**"},

It was in a movie called Robin and the 7 Hoods, made in 1964 with famous people from the Rat Pack. The song was supposed to win an award for Best Original Song in 1964, but it didn't.

Lowy, born on October 22, 1930, is a businessman from Australia who now lives in Israel. He is in charge of Westfield Corporation, a big company that manages shopping centers in the US, UK, and Europe, with assets worth $29.3 billion. Previously, he was in charge of Scentre Group, which owns and runs shopping centers in Australia and New Zealand. \nIn 2010, FIFA chose Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup, but Australia had initially bid for it. They withdrew their bid in June 2010. The 2018 and 2022 World Cups would be the 21st and 22nd, respectively. The bidding process started in 2009, and Australia, led by Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley, Quentin Bryce, and Elle Macpherson, expressed interest. However, if there are issues with Qatar hosting, Australia could reconsider its bid.\nThe Qatar 2022 World Cup bid was a request for the tournament to be held in Qatar. However, there's a problem - the FBI is looking into it for possible corruption, which caused the leader of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, to step down. Surprisingly, Qatar, with only 2 million people, will be the first Arab country to host the世界杯. \nIn 2009, Russia said it wanted to host the FIFA World Cup. They asked FIFA by the deadline. President Vladimir Putin, who really wanted this, asked Vitaly Mutko, the sports minister, to help with the plan. Mutko, who was also in charge of the Russian Football Union, said Russia would spend a lot of money, about $10 billion, on the event. The team working on the bid had people like RFU CEO Sorokin and a man named Alexander Djordjadze. In 2010, Russia decided not to try for 2022, but in December 2010, they were chosen to host the 2018 World Cup. \nThe Indonesia FIFA World Cup bid was the first time PSSI, the football association, tried to host the big世界杯 event. In 2010, FIFA said no because the government didn't help. Four Asian countries were trying to get the世界杯, but Indonesia was one of them. They had already had the tournament in 2002 in Japan and South Korea. Indonesia, which was once part of the Dutch East Indies, was the first Asian country to play in the World Cup in 1938, but they didn't win. \nThe Japan 2022 World Cup bid was the JFA's second try to host the event. If successful, it would have been Japan's second time hosting the World Cup, their first alone since 2002 when they shared it with South Korea. This would have made Japan the sixth country to host the世界杯 twice, following Italy, France, Mexico, Brazil, and Germany. In May 2010, they decided to focus only on winning the 2022 hosting rights. \nThe FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022 was chosen by FIFA, the group in charge of soccer. In March 2009, they started asking countries to say if they wanted to host. Thirteen countries tried, but one dropped out and another was not good enough. Nine countries were left, and some only wanted 2022, while the others wanted both. Europe's bids for 2018 were all gone by then. England, Russia, Belgium and Netherlands, and Portugal and Spain were the ones left for 2018. For 2022, Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the US tried. Indonesia couldn't do it because the government didn't support it, and Mexico didn't because of money problems. \nThe KFA, or Korea Football Association, tried to get the 2022 World Cup. If they succeeded, it would have been their second time hosting the big event, and it would have been the first time they did it alone, not with Japan like in 2002.

Donald Trump, a businessman from America, and Mike Pence, who was the governor of Indiana, won the election against Hillary Clinton, who was a former first lady, senator, and secretary of state, and Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia. Trump became the 45th president and Pence the 48th vice president on January 20, 2017. That day, people also voted for senators, representatives, governors, and other officials in different levels of government. \nThe Democratic primary in Michigan, a state in the US, happened on March 8, 2016. It was one of many elections to choose the Democratic candidate for the president in 2016.\nThe 1976 United States presidential race was the 48th one, happening on November 2, 1976. Jimmy Carter, who used to be the governor of Georgia, won as the surprise candidate, along with his partner Walter Mondale, a senator from Minnesota.

They won against Mitt Romney, who was from Massachusetts and was the Republican's nominee, and his helper, Paul Ryan, who later became the House Speaker. \nThe next US presidential election, happening on November 8, 2044, will be the 65th one. People will vote for people who will choose the president and vice president. Before that, there will be primary elections and meetings in the first part of 2044.

Some people believe he might be the same famous king Guiderius from legend. \nThe Catuvellauni were a Celtic group or place in southern Britain before the Romans came, and we know about them from writings from the 4th century.\nExplanation: The paragraph is about the culture that developed in Britain after the Romans arrived in AD 43 and formed a province called Britannia. This culture combined Roman and Celtic traditions because the Britons were already living there. Even after the Romans left in the 5th century, there was still a type of culture in southern Britain that lasted until the Anglo-Saxons came in around AD 597. They wrote in a Latin-like language called vernacular Latin during that time.\n\n Simplified: The culture in Britain during Roman times had parts from both the Romans and the local Britons. After the Romans left in the 5th century, there was a special culture in southern Britain that survived and used a Latin-like language until the Anglo-Saxons arrived in the 6th century. \nThe history of Wales started a long time ago when people first came to the area. Neanderthals lived in Wales over 230,000 years ago, and humans arrived around 31,000 BC. Modern humans have lived continuously in Wales since around 9,000 BC, leaving behind artifacts from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, the people who lived there spoke a language called Brittonic and were part of a group called Celtic Britons. The Romans came to Wales in the 400s and by 79 had defeated the Ordovices, taking control of the region. After the Romans left in the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons invaded, and the Brittonic language and culture began to change. The Welsh people, who were a big part of this group, started to develop their own identity separate from other Brittonic-speaking peoples by the 11th century. \nThe Durotriges were a group of people from a Celtic culture in Britain before the Romans arrived. They lived in places like Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, and Devon, especially on the east side of the River Axe. In 2009, they were found in a place called Shalfleet on an island called the Isle of Wight. After the Romans took over, two main towns named Durnovaria (Dorchester) and Lindinis (Ilchester) grew. Dorchester was the main city, and Ilchester became more important. They lived next to the Dumnonii to the west and the Belgae to the east. \nThe Corieltauvi, also called Coritani, lived in Britain before the Romans came. After the Romans arrived, they became part of the Roman Britain system. They lived in a place now called the English East Midlands. They were surrounded by other groups like the Brigantes, Cornovii, Dobunni, Catuvellauni, and Iceni. Their main city was called Ratae Corieltauvorum, which is now called Leicester. \nIn the year AD 43, which started on a Tuesday according to the Julian calendar, it was called the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Vitellius. Sometimes, it's also referred to as 796 Ab urbe condita. People started using the phrase AD 43 in the early Middle Ages, when the way to name years, called the Anno Domini system, became more common in Europe. \nThe Roman conquest of Britain started around 43 AD when Emperor Claudius sent his general, Aulus Plautius, to lead. This was not a sudden event, but a gradual process. Before this, Rome had tried to invade Britain many times, even before Julius Caesar's visits in 55 and 54 BC. Britain had been trading and talking with the Romans for over a hundred years. The Romans' influence on Britain's economy and culture, especially in the south, was already strong during the late pre-Roman Iron Age."}], "output": "\nThe Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 and ruled southeastern Britain prior to conquest by the Roman empire is King Togodumnus.**"},

This area includes five towns on Long Island's East End and the eastern part of Brookhaven. He has been in office since 1976 and is in charge of the Higher Education Committee. \nExplanation: The 1st State Senate district in New York is part of 62 districts in the state.

Right now, a person named John J. Flanagan, who is a Republican, represents this district. John Flanagan is also the leader and temporary president of the whole group of senators in New York. \nNesting is when we divide voting areas for one group of elected people to create the voting areas for another group. Imagine in California, there are 80 people in the lower house, called the Assembly, each representing a small part of the state.

But if we make both groups' districts separately, we don't use nesting. \nThe California State Senate is a part of the California State Legislature. California has a big population but not many lawmakers, which means each senator represents more people than each US congressperson represents. In the US House, there are 53 people representing California, each looking after about 704,566 people. But in the Senate, there are 40 senators, each taking care of about 931,349 people. That's like each senator representing a bigger area than a whole Delaware state.

He wrote it in 1967 when he was in the Beatles. The song was inspired by Paul McCartney's talk about taking a special drug called LSD, which made people upset. This happened after John Lennon said the Beatles were more popular than religion in 1966. The song is about being mindful of your actions and thinking about their effects. The music is different because it changes time rules, and the words remind us of songs from the Beatles, like Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love, from that time. \nWithin You Without You is a song from the Beatles' 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. George Harrison wrote it and it's his second song with Indian classical influences, inspired by his time in India learning from Ravi Shankar, a sitar teacher. The song was made without the other Beatles in London and has Indian instruments like sitar, dilruba, and tabla. It's different from their usual style, and it's about Indian spirituality, reflecting Harrison's interest in Hindu philosophy. Even though it's on the album, Harrison also showed his love for Indian culture by having Paramahansa Yogananda, a yoga teacher, in the album cover picture.\nLove Songs: A Compilation... Old and New is a music album by Phil Collins, a British singer. It came out on September 28, 2004, by two companies, Atlantic Recording Corporation and Rhino Entertainment. This album was made not long after another collection, called The Platinum Collection, was released in the same year, in April or May. \nSharon Gannon, born on July 4, 1951 in Washington D.C., is a multi-talented person who does yoga, cares for animals, creates music, writes, dances, and paints. She and David Life founded the Jivamukti Yoga Method, which became very popular in the West during the late 20th century. This yoga style focuses on making everyone, including animals, equal and helping people find enlightenment by being kind and protecting the environment. It teaches that to be truly happy, one must prioritize the well-being of all beings. Jivamukti yoga also suggests a vegan diet to minimize harm to the earth and others.\n\nThe core belief in Jivamukti is 'shunyata', meaning everything is connected and comes from our perception. The idea is that to change the world, start with changing yourself and your thoughts. This leads to a non-judgmental and responsible approach, where one's actions affect others and their own self-perception.\n\nGannon believes that treating others well leads to how others treat you, which in turn influences how you see yourself, and ultimately, who you are. \nSyd Barrett, a musician from England, created many songs while he was a part of the rock band Pink Floyd. He was very important for the band because he wrote most of their early songs. These songs were on their first album called The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and the second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. However, he had to stop playing with the band in 1968 because he was having a hard time with his mind. After that, David Gilmour took his place. After Pink Floyd, Barrett made two solo albums in 1970, but he stopped making music completely in 1972. No Plan is a special album with David Bowie's songs, released after he died on January 8, 2017, which would have been his 70th birthday. It has music from a Broadway play he was working on called Lazarus. The album includes songs like Lazarus, No Plan, and Killing a Little Time. These songs were first made by the play's actors for the show's soundtrack. Some of the songs are from Bowie's last album, Blackstar. When the album came out, it reached number 138 on a music chart. There's also a music video for Lazarus that was made to go with the album. It was directed by Tom Hingston. \nExplanation: Billy Bragg, a British musician, made a 3-song album called We Laughed for a project called Rosetta Life in 2005. It reached number 11 in the UK and number 38 in Ireland. The special thing about this single was that the lyrics for each song were written by three patients from Trimar Hospice in Weymouth. These patients, who were sick, shared their feelings and experiences. The songs were created with the help of English guitarist Robbie McIntosh. \nWho Can See It is a song by George Harrison, a British musician. It came out in 1973 on his album Living in the Material World. The song talks about Harrison's mixed feelings about the Beatles, the band he was in, and how he wanted to be separate from the huge success they had after they stopped making music together. Some people think he wrote it when he was feeling upset after being very popular as a solo artist and his charity work in Bangladesh. The lyrics are seen as deep and similar to John Lennon's song Plastic Ono Band, which he made during a time of personal reflection."}], "output": "\nGeorge Harrison.**"},

Even though the policy itself doesn't say they must do this, in California, if they don't accept a reasonable settlement that is within the policy limits, they can be responsible for the full amount the insured has to pay, even if it's more than the policy covers. This is because if they refuse to settle, they might be in a situation where they want to deny coverage, but they still have to consider if the offer is reasonable. The company must tell the insured about any settlement offers and not pressure them to give more than they should. If they do that, the company could be in trouble. \nMana Al Otaiba was born on May 15, 1946, to Saeed Al Otaiba in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Not much is known about his personal life.

The 'nerve' of this open covering is a special way of making a simple drawing (abstract simplicial complex) that shows how these smaller boxes fit together.

His work is still remembered through concepts like the Urysohn universal space. In 1923, he and Pavel Alexandrov defined the modern way of understanding compactness. \nHere's a simpler explanation: \n\nTopology is a math topic. When we have a space that isn't closed (not all points are together), the Alexandroff extension helps by adding one more point to make the whole space compact. This is called the Alexandroff extension, and it's named after a Russian mathematician named Pavel Alexandrov. \nSemyon Aranovich, born on July 23, 1934, in Derazhnya, Ukraine, was a film director who worked in both the Soviet Union and Russia.

They're talking about whether and how the Navy should use its big guns, called naval gunfire support, in modern times, especially during landings and other operations. In simple terms, it's about deciding the importance of naval guns in the Navy's work today. \nNaval gunfire support, also called shore bombardment, is when big ships use their guns to help soldiers on land, like during invasions. It's a part of something called Naval Fires. Nowadays, it's one of three ways ships help in amphibious attacks, along with planes and missiles. Ship guns have been used to attack land defenses since ships first started fighting. \nThe Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club was a playful name for the Seventh Fleet during the Vietnam War. This fleet, which was part of the US, did many actions during the war. They attacked enemies with airplane attacks from carriers, helped with navy guns, went on land with amphibious operations, watched and checked for trouble in patrolling and reconnaissance, and even used mines to protect. \nStarting in the 1890s, Italy's Royal Navy, called the Regia Marina, started building new battleships. These ships were small, had light armor, and were very fast. The first one, named after Admiral Saint Bon, was not big and had budget issues. Admiral Benedetto Brin, who took over, made the next two, called the Regina Margherita, bigger and planned to compete with other battleships. Brin couldn't finish building them because he died. Vittorio Cuniberti made the Regina Elena class, which were the fastest battleships at that time. During a war in 1911-12, they mainly supported Italian ground troops because the Ottoman Navy didn't fight much."}], "output": "\nThe captain of the only battleship to provide gunfire support during the Vietnam War, as mentioned in the passage, was Rear Adm.

You and the insurance company agree that if you follow the rules, they'll give your family a set amount when you pass away. Because it's guaranteed to stay active, the monthly or yearly payments (called premiums) are usually higher than for a shorter-term insurance policy called term life. The premiums don't change with age, and you can usually pay them until you die, or choose to pay them fully in specific timeframes like 10, 20, or 65.

In 631, Samo stopped a big fight with the Frankish Kingdom and won at the Battle of Wogastisburg. \nChach, who lived between 631 and 711 CE, was a king in Sindh.

He was the younger brother of Tecumseh. When he was young, people called him Lalawethika, but later changed it. He used to drink a lot, but then became a very important spiritual figure.

This group, called Tecumseh's Confederacy, grew and had about 2,000 warriors by the end. Tecumseh, who was the brother of The Prophet and a Shawnee leader, took charge in 1808. The US saw them as a danger and fought them first in a battle in 1811 called Tippecanoe. During a time called Tecumseh's War and the War of 1812, they went to war with the US.

Because of this disagreement, Harrison brought an army of around 1,000 people to stop them at a place called Prophetstown, near the Tippecanoe and Wabash rivers. \nProphetstown State Park, established in 2004 and located near Battle Ground, Indiana, is named after Tenskwatawa, a Native American leader.

It began when a man named Peter Aylen, who owned a lot of wood, got a group of Irish workers to stop other people, who were also cutting wood, from doing the same.

They were brought to the island as slaves and there were also Free Blacks who moved there to work as servants. By the 1800s, the number of Black people became larger than the White ones, making them the biggest ethnic group in Bermuda. In the 20th century, this group was officially recognized as an ethnic identity. \nIn Philadelphia and the nearby areas, a big part of the population comes from Irish roots. They've been living there since way before America was founded. During the American Revolution, some Irish people even helped in the fight for freedom. In the 1800s, when lots of people from Europe came to the US, including a big number of Irish from rural areas due to the famine, Philadelphia changed a lot. The city used to be mostly Quakers, but now it's very diverse because of different religions like Catholicism and Protestantism. Because the city needed workers for factories, the Irish started working in these industries. However, there were some problems with anti-Irish feelings in the 1840s and 1850s, which led to riots. But later, the Irish became successful and started their own schools and businesses. \nThe Americo-Liberians, also known as Congo people in Liberian English, are a group of people in Liberia who have African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and African heritage. They are related to the Sierra Leone Creole people, another ethnic group with similar background and culture. \n\nIn the 19th century, free African Americans and former slaves, known as Americo-Liberians, moved to Liberia to create the country. They identified themselves as such. Some of these African Americans also settled in Canada and later in Sierra Leone and Côte d'Ivoire, contributing to those places as well.\n\nAlthough there were differences in the definitions of Americo-Liberian and Congo in the past, today these terms are used interchangeably to describe an ethnic group made up of descendants of those who came to Liberia from Africa in 1822, including free African Americans, Caribbean people, Recaptured slaves, and Sierra Leone Creoles."}], "output": "\nThe ethnic group that settled in Canada in the 17th century and participated in the Shiners' War are the Irish.**"},

It means that when a writer writes a poem, they create it just for the poem itself, not to say something else, not to make the reader happy, and not even to fully understand it themselves. The focus is on the poem being a unique creation by the poet. \nThe Man Booker International Prize is a special prize given in the UK.

The piece is dedicated to Christabel, but Tertis didn't want it. Paul Hindemith, a violist, performed it first and people liked it a lot. It made Walton famous in British classical music. A reviewer said it was a genius piece. Tertis later changed his mind and decided to perform it too. \nThe Most Incredible Thing is a fairy tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, a Danish poet, in 1870. It's about a competition where people try to find the most amazing thing and what happens when someone wins.

It connects two cities, Copenhagen in Denmark and Malmö in Sweden. They are connected by a big bridge called the Øresund Bridge and also by a ferry between Helsingør in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden, which goes through the narrowest part of the strait. \nThe Øresund Bridge is a big bridge that connects Sweden and Denmark. It's for both trains and cars to travel across a water called the Øresund Strait. The bridge is almost 8 kilometers long and starts on a Swedish land and ends on an island called Peberholm in the middle. To get to the Danish island of Amager, there's a 4-kilometer tunnel called Drogden Tunnel that connects from Peberholm.\nThe Bjarkøy Fixed Link is a plan to connect three islands in Norway. There will be a tunnel under the sea to connect Grytøya and Bjarkøya, which will be 3.25 km long. There will also be a bridge, 300 meters long with a 900-meter causeway, to connect Grytøya to Sandsøya. The project includes building 3 kilometers of road on Grytøya to connect the existing roads to the new tunnel.

Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union, covering 450,295 square kilometers. It has about 10 million people, with 2.3 million having foreign origins. The country has a low population density, about 22 people per square kilometer, and most people live in cities, especially in the southern part. \nEuropean route E47 is a road that starts in Germany, goes through Denmark to Sweden, and is called Vogelfluglinie or Sydmotorvejen. It's mostly a motorway, except for 28 km in Germany, some city streets in Helsingør, and two ferry rides. There's a ferry between Germany and Denmark, and they're planning to build a bridge by 2020. The Danish parliament decided against a bridge and chose a tunnel instead, saying it's safer and better for the environment. There's also a ferry between Denmark and Sweden, and although there's a bridge-tunnel combo nearby, the Helsingør-Helsingborg ferry still has many rides. \nThe City Tunnel in Malmö, Sweden is a 17-mile train connection. It goes from Malmö Central Station (Malmö C) to the Öresund Line, which is like a bridge. Inside the city, there are 6 miles of the tunnel to make the train system work better. The project to build it was planned to cost 9.45 billion SEK. They started working on it in 2005 and finished in 2010.

These ferns are named after an Italian scientist named Luigi Ferdinando Marsili who lived from 1656 to 1730. \nBrabejum is a special kind of evergreen tree called Brabejum stellatifolium, which is found only in a place called the Western Cape in South Africa. It looks like a wild almond, is sometimes called bitter almond or ghoeboontjie. It grows near water in the province and is unique because it's Africa's only tree in a big group called the grevilleoid subfamily.\n\nThis tree is not very tall, but has lots of branches close to the ground. Its leaves are thin and have a little point at the end, and they come out in groups of six on the branches. In summer, it has many white flowers gathered together on spikes that start from reddish-brown buds. In autumn, it produces fruits that look like almonds, but they are very bitter. In the past, people used to boil and roast the nuts to make a drink.\nSinocyclocheilus is a type of freshwater fish from China, only found in specific areas like Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan. These fish are unique because they live in or near caves and have special features for cave life, like no scales, no color, and small eyes (some can't see). Some have a curved back and some even have a horn on their head, which we don't fully understand. Fish that live above ground or in non-cave areas don't have these cavefish traits.\n\nThey are usually not very big, up to 23 cm long. Each species has a small habitat range, which makes them endangered. Many species in this genus need more study to understand their populations. \nMyiodynastes is a bird group in the Tyrannidae family. In 1857, a scientist named Charles Lucien Bonaparte made this group. There are 5 bird types in it, called sulphur-bellied flycatchers. This name also applies to one bird in the group. The name Myiodynastes comes from two Greek words: muia for fly and dunastẽs for ruler. \nLeptospermum is a type of small trees and shrubs in the Myrtle family, called tea trees. Sometimes, Melaleuca is also called this. Most of them live only in Australia, especially in the southern part, but a few can be found in New Zealand and Southeast Asia. These plants have five petals and five groups of stamens, and their flowers have one central style. The fruit they produce is a hard, wooden capsule. The first time people wrote about them was in 1776 by two German botanists. But it wasn't until 1979 that they clearly defined the different species within the genus. Leptospermums can grow in many types of environments, but they often prefer wet, soil with little nutrients. They are popular for gardening, making honey, and in flower arrangements. \nAraripesuchus was a type of ancient crocodile-like animal that lived during the Cretaceous Period in places like Western Africa and South America. There are at least five different species in this group. People are still trying to figure out how they are related, especially with Araripesuchus wegeneri. This species was small, walked upright, and had special teeth that show it might have eaten both plants and animals. Its limbs were delicate, suggesting it was a land animal, unlike today's crocodiles and alligators. \nThe Marsileaceae is a small group of ferns that live in water or near it. They don't look like other ferns at first, but they are called pepperwort or water-clover family because their leaves look like four-leaf clovers. People sometimes use the leaves on Saint Patrick's Day instead of clover. There are three genera and around 50 to 80 species in this family, and most of them belong to the Marsilea genus. \nThe Be'er Sheva fringe-fingered lizard, a type of lizard in the Beersheva family (Lacertidae), belongs to the Lacertinae subgenus and Acanthodactylus tribe. It's a distinct species recognized by its unique features and is found in isolated areas. Even though it shares some genes with Acanthodactylus pardalis, its differences in appearance separate it. These lizards, like others in the Acanthodactylus genus, lay between 3 and 7 eggs at a time. They can grow up to 17 to 20 centimeters, but some can be even bigger. This species is unique to the Negev desert in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, which is a region with a lot of biodiversity."}], "output": "\nThe Marsilea genus has more individual species of plants.**"},

They meet at a place called St James's Palace and officially announce the new person who will be the king or queen (Succession). According to a law called the Act of Settlement from 1701, the new person becomes the ruler right away. This proclamation also makes sure we know who the new heir is. \nThe Grange Hall in Somerset, a town in Jackson County, Illinois, is where the local Grange group, Somerset Township's chapter, meets. It was made in 1912, and it's the second Grange hall because the first one, from 1876, burned down in 1909. The red-brick building, designed in the Commercial style, was built by a person named W. A. Pitman. The Grange Hall was a place for farmers to talk about farming, suggest rules for the government, and even published a newspaper called the Union Farmer from there until 1914. It was also a place for community events, elections, and social gatherings. In 1988, the hall was fixed up, and it still works as a polling place for the township today. \nCrowther Masonic Hall, also known as Freemasons' Hall, in Kollam, India, was a main meeting place for Freemasonry lodges in the Quilon area.

The tallest building now is the Mirante do Vale, standing 170 meters, from 1960.\n\nHowever, the city has many smaller buildings, usually up to 80 meters, and not many skyscrapers due to rules that limit their construction. The financial district, where many skyscrapers are, has moved. Even though São Paulo has 10 buildings over 90 meters, it's ranked 10th in the world for these tall buildings, after some cities like Hong Kong, New York, Tokyo, and so on. \nOne Raffles Link is a big office building in Marina Centre, Singapore. It has 6 floors, a ground floor, and is run by a company called Hongkong Land. It was finished in 2000 and was made by famous architects Kohn Pedersen Fox and Aedas LPT Architects. It cost a lot of money to build, $340 million, and is a very good place for big companies like VISA, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, and Citibank to work. The building is special because it has big open spaces, and there's a mall underground called CityLink Mall that connects it to a train station and other big buildings nearby. \nCapitaGreen, or Market Street Tower, is an office building in Raffles Place, Singapore. It was made by a designer named Toyo Ito and finished in 2014. This tall building, reaching 242 meters, is one of the highest in the city. \nChevron House, previously known as Caltex House, is a tall building in the middle of Singapore's business area. It's at 30 Raffles Place, right next to Raffles Place, where many important buildings and places are close by, like the Singapore Land Tower and Hitachi Tower, Change Alley, and The Arcade, all less than 100 meters away. You can easily go to the building by taking the Raffles Place MRT Station, which is underground. The building is connected to Hitachi Tower, which shares a floor for shopping. \nRaffles Place MRT Station is a big underground station in Singapore that connects two train lines, North South Line and East West Line, in the heart of the city, called Downtown Core. It's very close to the important area for money stuff, Raffles Place. It's super busy because it's a place where many trains and buses meet. The station has many doors to go in and out, and one of them looks like a small copy of an old building called John Little building. \n Republic Plaza is a very tall building in Singapore, right in the middle of the city's business area, called Downtown Core. It's one of three tallest buildings, along with OUB Centre and UOB Plaza One. It's 280 meters (like 919 feet) high and was finished in 1995. Even though the city doesn't usually have earthquakes, the building was made to be strong and safe against them."}], "output": "\nThe tallest skyscraper in the city of Singapore, One Raffles Place, was succeeded by the Bank of China Tower in 2016.**"},

Boren or United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.? \n\n Passage: \nIn 1948, the United States Supreme Court decided a big antitrust case called United States v. Paramount Pictures. This case, also known as the Hollywood Antitrust Case, was about movie studios that owned their own theaters and didn't let other theaters show their films. The court said this wasn't fair and went against the US laws that stop businesses from making agreements to not work with others. This decision changed the way movies were made, shared, and shown in theaters. \nIn the case Craig v. Boren in 1976, the top court in the US said that rules or actions based on someone's sex could be judged under a more careful examination (intermediate scrutiny) because they were part of a bigger promise in the Fourteenth Amendment to treat everyone equally. This was the first time the court made such a decision.\nBlock booking is when a theater buys many movies at once from a movie studio. It was very common in Hollywood during the 1930s, but the Supreme Court stopped it in 1948. Independent theaters had to agree to show a lot of the studio's movies without seeing them first. This let the studios sell both good and not-so-good movies together, making things cheaper for them. When a theater buys a movie without seeing it, that's called blind bidding. \nRichard Baker vs. Gerald Nelson is a court case from Minnesota in 1971. The state court said a law that only allowed marriage between people of different genders did not go against the US Constitution. Baker tried to argue, but in 1972, the top US court said there wasn't a big enough federal issue to consider and dismissed his case. This meant the court really decided the case, making it a precedent. In 2013, Minnesota made same-sex marriage legal, but in 2015, the US Supreme Court said in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex marriage should be legal everywhere. \nThe Van der Peet case, decided in 1996 by the Supreme Court of Canada (2 S.C.R. 507), is a significant one about how the Constitution Act of 1982 protects Aboriginal rights. The court said that Aboriginal people's right to fish doesn't allow them to sell fish for profit. Because of this, they created a test called the Van der Peet test to figure out if there is an Aboriginal right. This test is part of a series of cases known as the Van der Peet trilogy, which also includes R v NTC Smokehouse Ltd and R v Gladstone. \nThe case, United States v. Binion, 132 F. App'x 89 (2005), is about a court in the Eighth Circuit in the United States. They looked at a person's punishment because the trial court used some recent rules from the Supreme Court. These rules are from decisions called United States v. Booker and United States v. Fanfan. The court agreed with the Federal District Court's decision about the punishment. \nIn 1999, there was a court case called Lau Kong Yung vs. the Director of Immigration in Hong Kong. It was connected to a previous important case, Ng Ka Ling vs. the same person, in 1999. Before Lau's case, the Chinese government's Standing Committee made a change to the Basic Law, which affects how people like Lau could live in Hong Kong. Because of this change, the court in Lau was the first to consider an NPCSC interpretation when applying the Basic Law. \nIn 2006, the Ohio Supreme Court looked at a case called Norwood, Ohio v. Horney. This case came after another big case, Kelo v. City of New London, where the top court in the US said it's okay for cities to take land for building things through something called eminent domain. In Norwood, the court was focusing on how Ohio's own state constitution limited this power. So, the main point was about Ohio rules versus US rules."}], "output": "\nUnited States v.

It was made by someone named Dewa Agung Gusti Sideman a long time ago, in the 1700s. At first, it was used for court meetings in 1945. The building has been repainted twice, once in the 1920s and again in the 1960s. People who found it out knew it had a big history, but not many people outside Bali knew about it. Inside, there's a story about a character named Bhima Swarga, which comes from a big Hindu story called the Mahabharata. But the story at the Kertha Gosa Pavilion is just a small part of the whole story. \nThe Oleson Park Music Pavilion, or Karl King Bandshell, is a place in Fort Dodge, Iowa, where music concerts happen. It was made for bands, named after Karl King, a famous band composer. The person who designed it, Henry L. Kamphoefner, also made a bandstand in Sioux City before. It was built because of a program called Works Progress Administration (WPA) that helped pay for 85% of the construction. The city of Fort Dodge paid the rest. The building looks modern with some Deco style and is 36 feet tall. It's good at making music sound great. Before this, there was a bandstand in the city square from the 1920s. In 1976, they dedicated it to Karl King, and in 2003, it became part of a special list of important places called the National Register of Historic Places. \nThe Concord Pavilion, previously called Sleep Train Pavilion and Chronicle Pavilion, is a big open space for shows in Concord, California.

Which was their first? \n\n Passage: \nChildren's Mercy Park, previously known as Sporting Park and Livestrong Sporting Park, is a soccer field in Kansas City, Kansas. It's where the Sporting Kansas City team plays. It's not too far from a race track called Kansas Speedway. The stadium opened in 2011 for soccer games and can hold 18,467 people, but it can grow to 25,000 for concerts. Most games get around 21,000 people. This stadium is the third place the Wizards, the old team, played, first at Arrowhead Stadium from 1996 to 2007, then at CommunityAmerica Ballpark from 2008 to 2010. In 2013, it was a big deal because it hosted three important soccer events: the MLS All-Star Game, the US men's national soccer team, and the MLS Cup, which are very special in the US. It's the only stadium that did all three in the same year. \nCommunityAmerica Ballpark is a baseball field in Kansas City, Kansas, near Piper. It's where the Kansas City T-Bones, a team in the American Association, play. Before, it was the home for the Kansas City Wizards (now Sporting Kansas City) who played soccer. It's located in the Village West area, at 1800 Village West Parkway. High schools nearby, like Bonner Springs High, use it for games, like the Butch Foster Memorial Baseball Classic. It's also used for other events, like concerts.\nShawnee Mission District Stadium is a place in Overland Park, Kansas where different sports happen. It's mostly used by three high schools, Shawnee Mission North, Northwest, and East. There's also a women's soccer team called FC Kansas City that uses it. In 2008, a soccer game was played between the Kansas City Wizards (later known as Sporting Kansas City) and Colorado Rapids during a special soccer competition called the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. \nIn 1997, the Kansas City Wizards, a soccer team, played their second year in the league and their games were held at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. In those days, ties were not allowed, so if a match ended with the same score, they used a special part called a shootout to decide who wins. The numbers you see in the paragraph don't include goals from shootouts because that's not how they counted points. If a team won a shootout, they got 2 points, but if they lost, they got 0. So, even though the regular season had 49 points shown, it doesn't include the points from shootouts. \nIn the 1999 season, the Kansas City Wizards played their games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. In that year, MLS didn't allow games to end in a tie, so they used a shootout to decide if there was a draw. The numbers you see in the statistics don't include goals from shootouts. The total points for the regular season, even though it shows 24, were actually calculated based on points from wins and losses in the shootout (2 points for a win, 0 for a loss). The team's first coach, Ron Newman, was replaced by Bob Gansler during the season. \nThe 2004 MLS Cup, the 9th one, was a soccer game to find the best team for that year. It was between D.C. United and the Kansas City Wizards. They played on November 14, 2004, at a place called The Home Depot Center in California. D.C. United won the game 3-2, with a goal that happened because a Wizard player, Alex Zotinca, accidentally scored for D.C. United. This win was D.C. United's fourth time winning the MLS Cup and their first time since 1999. \nHere's a simplified version of the paragraph: \n\nThis is a list of players who have played at least one game for Sporting Kansas City, starting from when the team joined Major League Soccer in 1996. Players who were on the team but never played in a real game are not included. If a player played in other matches like the US Open Cup or CONCACAF Champions League but never in the MLS, their info is at the end of the list. \nIn 2008, the Wizards' games were held at a temporary field called Community America Ballpark in Kansas City, Kansas, which was their first season there."}], "output": "\nArrowhead Stadium.**"},

There are two main types: Oxycoccus in Europe and Vaccinium macrocarpon in North America. In Europe, Vaccinium oxycoccos is farmed in central and northern areas, while Vaccinium macrocarpon is grown in the northern US, Canada, and Chile. Some people consider Oxycoccus a separate genus.

It was made by Craig Zobel and shows a story where a person pretends to be a police officer and tricks a fast food manager, making the manager do wrong things. The movie is based on a real event where a worker at a McDonald's in Kentucky was tricked. Ann Dowd, who played the manager, got a special award for her acting. \nExplanation: The strip search phone call scam was a long-lasting trick that happened for around 10 years. In 2004, someone got caught. The scam worked like this: a man would call a restaurant or store, pretending to be a police officer. Then, he would ask managers to search female workers and do other strange things, saying it was part of the police's work. These calls mostly happened in small towns in rural areas of the US, usually at fast-food places.\nDevyani Khobragade was a worker for India's foreign service. When she was in New York as a deputy consul, she got into big trouble because she told lies on a paper for her maid's visa. She said she would pay the maid a fair wage, but she didn't. When she got into trouble for this, she had to go to a judge and they searched her body. This made both India and the US mad and caused a big problem between the two countries. In 2016, she even wrote a book called The White Sari. \nA&W Restaurants is a popular fast-food place known for its special root beer and root beer floats. It started in 1919 when Roy W. Allen started a small root beer stand in California. A friend of his, Frank Wright, joined him and together they opened the first A&W restaurant in Sacramento in 1923. The name comes from their last names, Allen and Wright. People love their cold mugs - they keep the mugs in the freezer and fill them with their famous root beer before giving them to customers. \nRinger Hut is a Japanese fast-food chain that serves special dishes from Nagasaki, like Champon and Sara udon. They got the name from a place called Ringer House, which was a tourist attraction in 1966. The founders, Hamakatsu Co. from Nagasaki, took the name Hut from Pizza Hut. They have over 550 restaurants in Japan, Taiwan, and San Jose, and also have 100 other restaurants called Hamakatsu that serve tonkatsu. The company has two main offices in Fukuoka and Tokyo. \nPolice perjury, also known as testifying falsely in police slang, is when a police officer gives incorrect information in a court. This usually happens in criminal trials to make the case against someone the police think is guilty. If there were problems during the person's arrest or search, it might lead to the defendant being found not guilty. Perjury can also mean making up facts to charge someone the police believe is guilty, or even lying to frame someone who is actually innocent. In simple terms, it's when a police officer lies when they are under oath to help win a case. \nJacob D. Robida was a teenager from Massachusetts who, in 2006, attacked people at a gay bar in New Bedford. He ran away and went to Charleston, West Virginia, where he took a woman named Jennifer Dunlap hostage. On February 4th, he was stopped by a police officer for a traffic issue and shot the officer, then continued driving and shot at a police officer. He was caught and tried to escape but hit a spike strip and stopped. In Norfork, he lost control of his car, hit two parked cars, and killed his hostage by shooting her. The police then shot him. \nIn Japan, there's a thing called part-time job terrorism (バイトテロ). People who work part-time, like at fast-food places, sometimes do silly acts like hanging upside down on countertops (called planking) to get attention from their friends. They do this by taking photos or videos and sharing them on social media. These people often feel unhappy with their jobs, because they don't get much money and have to work long hours. In Japan, doing such pranks is seen as disrespectful, but it's not as common in other cultures."}], "output": "\nThe movie based on the scam where a male called small town fast-food restaurants pretending to be a police officer and having them strip search employees is \"Compliance.\"**"},

He mainly played for the Chicago White Sox. He was a really strong and powerful hitter during his time, and he's the only player in history to have 7 straight seasons with great stats like a .300 batting average, over 100 runs, hits, walks, and home runs. From 1991 to 1997, he hit around .330, had an average of 36 home runs, and 118 RBIs every year. He was often considered the best player of his time and won the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award twice, in 1993 and 1994.

He only hit .029 in his games, which is the lowest batting average ever recorded for someone who had at least 100 tries. This means he didn't get many hits during his career. \nHoward Dick Kauffman, born on June 22, 1888 and passed away in 1948, was a baseball player who played for 11 years. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for two seasons with the St. Louis Browns in 1914 and 1915. Kauffman was a first baseman and had a career batting average of .259 in the MLB, scoring 10 runs, hitting 36 times, with nine doubles, two triples, and 16 RBIs in 44 games.\n\nHe started his professional baseball journey in 1911 with the York White Roses in a minor league. His first MLB season was in 1914, and he was called back again in 1915. After that, he only played in minor leagues. In those years, he had a minor league batting average of .279, with 1,239 hits in 1,217 games.\n\nKauffman played for various minor league teams like the York White Roses, Elmira Colonels, Atlanta Crackers, and Nashville Volunteers.

He was a catcher with a batting average of .147 in 55 games, scoring 8 runs, hitting 17 times, having one double and one triple, and 7 RBIs. He started in the minor league with Binghamton Bingoes in 1912 and made his MLB debut on September 24, 1912. In 1915, after his MLB career, he went back to the minors. In those minors, he had a .261 batting average with 303 hits in 381 games. He was 5 feet tall and weighed 160 pounds, and he batted and threw right-handed. \nGerman Barranca Costales, born on October 19, 1956 in Mexico, was a baseball player who used to play as a second baseman. He started his career in the Major League Baseball (MLB) on September 2, 1979, when he was 22, playing for the Kansas City Royals against the New York Yankees. In 1979 and 1980, he played 5 and 7 games, respectively, with a batting average of .600.\n\nOn January 21, 1981, he was traded from the Royals to the Cincinnati Reds for Cesar Geronimo. In 1981 and 1982, he played for the Reds, with batting averages of .333 and .255, respectively. His last game in the MLB was on July 11, 1982, at the age of 25. He had a .250 batting average and was leading the National League in triples before the All-Star break.\n\nDue to his performance, he was sent to the Indianapolis Triple-A affiliate of the Reds. On September 7, 1982, he was traded again, this time to the Detroit Tigers as part of a deal. In total, German played 67 games in the MLB, with 62 at-bats, 19 runs, 18 hits, 2 doubles, 3 triples, 5 stolen bases, and a fielding percentage of .893. His career average was .290. \nThe Tigers, a baseball team from Detroit in 1921, did not do very well. They finished sixth in their league, 27 games behind the Yankees, and had a record of 71 wins and 82 losses. Even though they didn't win a lot, they hit the ball very well, with 1,724 hits and the highest team batting average in American League history at .316. Their three outfielders, Harry Heilmann, Ty Cobb, and Bobby Veach, were all excellent with high batting averages and RBIs.\n\nHowever, the team's weakness was their pitching. They had a high ERA of 4.40, and only one pitcher, Dutch Leonard, had a good ERA below 4.24. This shows that sometimes, even when you hit a lot, if you can't stop the other team from scoring, it can affect the outcome."}], "output": "\nThe arcade game named after the player with a 0.300 batting average for 7 consecutive seasons is not explicitly mentioned in the passage. However, given the context of the question and the fact that the player in question is a famous baseball player, it is likely referring to Frank Thomas, also known as \"The Big Hurt.\" The passage doesn't directly state a game named after him, but it is mentioned that \"Frank Thomas' Big Hurt\" is a pinball game made by Bill Parker. So, the closest answer would be \"Frank Thomas' Big Hurt,\" which is a pinball game, not an arcade game.**"},

It was created in 1893 by a company for a band leader named John Philip Sousa. It's different from a tuba because it's bent in a circle around the musician and has a big, flaring bell that sends the sound forward. This instrument is great for marching bands and other music because it's easy to carry and the sound goes far. At first, sousaphones were made of strong brass, but later, they became lighter with materials like fiberglass. Both types are still used today. \nA bukkehorn, also known as a bockhorn in Swedish, is a musical instrument from ancient Norway and Sweden.

People usually call it 10,000 meters instead of 10K because they measure it in meters, not kilometers. \nHarry Prowell was a long-distance runner from Guyana who competed in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. He was really good at marathon and set the national record for Guyana at that time. He was the first Guyanese to run in the Olympics for a marathon and one of the most well-known runners of his kind.

It started in 1997 and is organized by a group called the European Athletics Association. Before, it was called the European 10,000 Metres Challenge because it was part of a bigger event. It started as a competition for runners from Spain and Portugal, who would race in a special event from 1991 to 1996. The first five times they held it, they were in a place called the Iberian Peninsula. The race changed its name to the European 10,000m Cup in 2005. \nThe 2015 Pan American Games, also known as the Toronto 2015 Pan-Am Games, were a big sports event with lots of different sports.

It comes out每周一次 and is made by Time Inc. UK, with the editor being Ali Hall. \nChrysalis was a magazine for women, started in 1977 by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie in Los Angeles. They created it at a place called the Woman's Building. The magazine was different because it combined lots of things like politics, books, art, and culture. It was made by a group of women who shared ideas together, called consciousness-raising. The magazine had famous writers like Audre Lorde, Robin Morgan, and Adrienne Rich, who were important in the feminist movement. They made ten issues, but in 1981, they had to stop because they didn't have enough money.\nA women's magazine started in Malaysia in 1932. By the 2000s, there were about fifty local magazines for women, and some of them had an Islamic focus. Some famous international magazines, like Elle Malaysia (launched in 2014) and Women's Health (in 2015), began to be published there too. In addition, comic and movie magazines are very popular in Malaysia. \nIn Austria, the magazine industry is mostly influenced by Germany. But, towards the end of the 1990s, this influence lessened. It's still strong for women's and fashion magazines, but business ones are different. Magazines in Austria focus on news, science, and unique topics. Also, magazines play a big role because the press market includes both magazines and newspapers. \nThe Transition House Association of Nova Scotia (THANS) is a group in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada that helps women by running shelters. Pamela Harrison is in charge and also works on provincial programs. Rhonda Fraser, from Chrysalis House, is part of THANS. They have an event every year to remember a sad event called the École Polytechnique massacre. THANS started in 1989 and talked to 34 women who were hurt and tried to help them through family law. In 2000, they said most women didn't like the legal way they were helped. In 2008, they wanted a special law called the Domestic Violence Elimination Act, but it didn't happen. In 2009, a politician named Darrell Dexter mentioned THANS when he wanted to spend more money on special homes. In 2012, they worked with other groups to put on a ballet about domestic violence. \nLifestyle magazine is a type of magazine that talks about how people live their lives. It can be for boys, girls, or even about staying healthy and fit. It covers things like travel, having fun, dressing up, decorating, and learning about different cultures. When we say lifestyle magazine, we mainly mean the way it writes and the topics it covers. \nA customer magazine is a magazine made by a company to talk to its customers. It's like a regular magazine, but the company pays for some or all of it. The main purpose is not to make money from selling copies or ads, but to help the company achieve specific goals, like selling more products or making customers like their brand more. For example, airlines give out in-flight magazines to their passengers, and supermarkets give out magazines to show off their food. Some digital companies like WebMD and Net-À-Porter also have their own customer magazines. Sometimes, these magazines have ads to help pay for them, but they can also make the magazine look more like a regular one. \nRick Wilber is a writer from America. He has written over 35 short stories in magazines like Analog, Asimov's, and Pulphouse, and also in books like Alien Sex and Chrysalis. He has written novels too, like Rum Point and The Cold Road, and even a book about his life called My Father's Game. He has also written textbooks on writing, like Modern Media Writing and Magazine Feature Writing."}], "output": "\nNo, Chrysalis and Look are not both women's magazines. Chrysalis was a magazine for women, focusing on politics, books, art, and culture, with a feminist twist, while Look is a magazine for young women that primarily covers fashion, shopping, and celebrity style."},

Here's a simpler version: \n\nBergson, born in 1859 and died in 1941, was a famous philosopher from France who had a big influence between the 1900s and the 1940s, even in philosophy discussions after the war. \nThomas Friedman, born on July 20, 1953, is an American writer and journalist who has won three Pulitzer Prizes.\nExplanation of Metaphysics is a 1903 book by Henri Bergson. He believes that reality is not like a list of separate things, but more like a continuous flow, like what some philosophers talk about. Reality can't be fully understood by just looking at parts separately. Bergson says we should try to feel or understand the whole, not just observe it from the outside. This means we should try to connect with the object, not just observe it. \nDuration is a idea about time and how we experience it, created by a French thinker named Henri Bergson. He thought that the way time is understood by scientists and math, like Herbert Spencer, wasn't right because they couldn't understand how it feels or how it changes for each person. Bergson believed that time is not like a straight line we can measure, but more like a continuous flow that can speed up or slow down. Instead of trying to measure each moment, we understand it through our personal experiences and feelings.\n\nBergson decided to focus on the inner world of humans, which is a type of duration that is not just one thing but also not many things at once. It's hard to explain directly because it's a deep, personal feeling that can't be fully described. We can understand it better by thinking creatively and imagining it, not by using exact numbers or pictures. \nSamuel Eliot Morison was a famous American historian known for his books about maritime history and American history. He got a special degree from Harvard in 1912 and taught there for 40 years. He won big prizes for his books about Columbus and John Paul Jones. In 1942, he wrote a very big history of the US Navy during World War II, which took 15 years to finish. He also wrote a popular book about American history and helped write a book about the country's growth. Morison got many special honors, like honorary degrees and awards, for his work. \nOn April 18, 2011, the Pulitzer Prizes for 2011 were announced. The Los Angeles Times and the New York Times both won two awards. There was no prize for the Breaking News category. The Wall Street Journal, which hadn't won since 2007, won one. Jennifer Egan's book, A Visit From the Goon Squad, won Fiction, even though it had already won a similar prize. Carol Guzy, a photographer from The Washington Post, became the first person to win four Pulitzer Prizes. \nÉlan vital is a concept from a book by a French man named Henri Bergson in 1907. He talked about how things, like living things, can organize and grow by themselves without being forced. Some people call it vital force and it's like an invisible energy that helps things develop and change. Bergson connected it with our understanding of the world and our inner experiences. \nTime and Free Will is a book written by Henri Bergson. It was his first big idea, which he shared in 1889. The book talks about a big question, called free will. Bergson thinks that philosophers are mixed up because they try to connect something that doesn't stretch (unextended) with something that does (extended). He uses this to explain his idea about how time works, which many people in Europe found very important later on."}], "output": "\nThomas Friedman has won more Pulitzer Prizes than Henri Bergson.**"},

It came out on January 4, 2010, but the record was taken away from stores because the company that made it couldn't pay for it.

Later, in 2012, she made a new album called Born to Die and wanted to share her old album again. \nBlue Jeans is a song by Lana Del Rey from her album Born to Die in 2012. It was released on April 8th as the third single. The song has a mix of slow and hip hop style and was made with help from Emile Haynie.

The Ottomans changed it. This church was connected to a place called Christ Pantepoptes. It's the only 11th-century church in Istanbul that still looks just the same. It's important for understanding middle Byzantine architecture, but not many people study it. \nThe Nusretiye Clock Tower, also known as Tophane Clock Tower, is a clock tower in a place called Tophane, which is in a part of Istanbul called Beyoğlu. It's close to a mosque and a kiosk by the Bosphorus, a big waterway in Europe.

It was built in 1888 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Queen Victoria's being on the throne. It's a special building because it had new ways of being strong and became a well-known place for people to visit when they go to the beach. People in the city still love it, but some think it's not the prettiest. The government has said it's important to protect the clock tower because of its history and design, so they put it on a list called Grade II. \nThe Galle Clock Tower, also known as Anthonisz Memorial Clock Tower, is a well-known structure in Galle, Sri Lanka, inside the Galle Fort. It stands as a symbol and offers a great view from its place overlooking the Moon Bastion, which used to be the guard room.

People think it might have been made a long time ago, maybe in 1549. It was used to watch and look out for the big harbor and the land around, and during a big event called the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, it was also used. In the 1700s, they put a clock inside the tower. \nExplanation: The Tashkyopryu Mosque is a mosque in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, built by Turkish people who controlled the area during the 16th century.

It started in 1983 and is in a place called Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. In 1999, the company had 60 stores that only open during Halloween and was bought by another company named Spencer Gifts. \nSpencer's is a store in the US and Canada that sells fun and unusual gifts, like toys and clothing. They also have things for parties, like costumes and jewelry, and during Halloween, they have a separate store called Spirit Halloween. They have over 600 stores like these.\nA warehouse store is a place where you can buy food and groceries at lower prices than regular supermarkets. It's simple and doesn't have fancy decorations. You'll find lots of items on big shelves, but you don't need to join a special club to shop there. You can buy things in big quantities too. When you walk in, you'll see discounts right away, then go to the produce and deli. You bag your own groceries to save money. Some big companies like Kroger and Albertsons run these stores to reach people who want good deals and to help their regular stores save costs. One example of a separate warehouse chain is WinCo Foods. \nFedMart was a discount store created by Sol Price, who later started Price Club. He first opened a store in San Diego, in an old airport hangar, only for government workers who paid $2 per family as a membership. The store did very well in its first year. Over the next 20 years, it grew to have 45 stores, making over $300 million in sales each year, and spread to the Southwest United States. Price sold part of the chain to a German company called Hugo Mann in 1975, but he had to leave the leadership soon after. FedMart eventually closed in 1982. \nWalt Whitman Shops, a fancy store place in Huntington Station, New York, used to be called Walt Whitman Mall. It's on a road called Walt Whitman Road and New York Avenue. Inside, you can find famous stores like Bloomingdale's, Lord & Taylor, Macy's, and Saks Fifth Avenue. The mall is run by a big company that builds malls, called Melvin Simon and Associates. They also own another big mall in Garden City. People can take buses from Suffolk County Transit, Nassau Inter-County Express, and Huntington Area Rapid Transit to get there. \nCitadel Mall is a big shopping place in Charleston, South Carolina. It's 1,138,527 square feet and was opened in 1981. It's near two roads, Sam Rittenberg Boulevard and I-526. There are over 100 stores, like big stores for buying clothes and things (Belk, Dillard's, Dick's Sporting Goods, Sears, and the first Target with a new food area), and in 2013, the owner had to give it back because they couldn't pay the money they borrowed. In 2014, a new group bought it, and they're trying to sell it to someone else now. \nHalloween Adventure Stores, also known as Masquerade, LLC, is a big store that sells things for Halloween. They have lots of costumes, masks, and makeup for both kids and grown-ups. They were started in 1981 by two brothers in a place called Philadelphia. They have stores in many states like Pennsylvania, New York, and California. In 2006, they had over 120 stores in malls that only stayed open for a short time during Halloween. They also sell things online because some people like to compare prices. Their main competitor is a store called Halloween Thrills. \nEastern Hills Mall is a shopping place in Clarence, near Buffalo, New York. It's on a road called Transit Road, which separates Clarence from Amherst. The mall is near a small hill and has three parts: two long parts that go north and south and one short one that goes east and west, making it like a letter 'L'. There's a big store, a food court, and a movie theater there. But, not many people go there, so some stores close and are replaced by smaller, local shops. People say it's not very active, so it's listed on a website for dead malls."}], "output": "\nSpencer Gifts has over 600 stores in the United States and Canada.**"},

He got his education - a bachelor's degree from Berea College, an MA from Purdue University, and a Ph.D. in philosophy also from Purdue. He started and leads an online encyclopedia called the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. He has written, worked on, or helped create over ten books. \nBerea College is a college in Berea, Kentucky, where students don't have to pay for their education. It's about 35 minutes away from Lexington by car. The college was started in 1855 and is special because it was the first in the southern US to let boys and girls go to school together and be friends, regardless of their skin color. Berea College gives every student full scholarship, which is $97,200 for four years.\nAltruism is a principle where a person's actions are considered good only if they help others, not just themselves. It says that how good or bad an action is depends on how it affects others, not just the person doing it. James Fieser explains it like this: An action is good if it makes most people better off, except for the person doing it. Auguste Comte believed in being kind to others and living for their benefit. If someone follows these ideas, they are called an altruist. \nAlice Lloyd College is a school in Pippa Passes, Kentucky, where students live on campus. It was started in 1923 by two ladies, Alice Spencer Geddes Lloyd from Massachusetts and June Buchanan from New York, to teach people from the Appalachian area how to lead. At first, it was called Caney Junior College. Later, in the 1980s, it became a four-year school that gives degrees. The college is approved by an organization called Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). \nA work college in the US is a special kind of liberal arts school that combines work, learning, and service. Everyone studies and works there, not just those who need help. It's a public or private school that gives bachelor's degrees, and the school expects students to work a lot as part of their education. This is different from Federal Work Study, which only helps students who can't afford it. If a student doesn't do well in their work, they might get kicked out. They have to work, not pay to skip it. Students help run the school and feel like they own a part of it. This way, the school runs more smoothly and costs less, which makes the tuition lower for students. \nLiberal arts colleges are schools that focus on undergraduate education in subjects like arts, humanities, and sciences. They teach general knowledge and help students develop their thinking skills. This kind of education is different from training for specific jobs or technical skills. Liberal arts started in Europe, but it's mostly known in the US. You can find these colleges in many countries, and there's even a list of international ones that belong to a group called the Association of American Colleges and Universities. Liberal arts colleges teach many subjects to help students learn general knowledge and think broadly. They don't just teach one main thing, but also let students learn about different areas like sciences and humanities. This idea comes from Europe, but most liberal arts colleges in America are based on this way of learning. \nNancy K. Pearson is an American poet. She wrote two books, The Whole by Contemplation of a Single Bone (2016) and Two Minutes of Light (2008), published by Fordham University Press and Perugia Press respectively.

In 1960, the Privy Council made a rule that this name applies to their male grandchildren, even if they don't have royal titles. Some people with royal titles don't usually have a surname, but if they need one, they can use Mountbatten-Windsor. \nThe Mountbatten family comes from a long line of European royalty, originally from a German family called the Battenberg. During a time when many British people didn't like Germany, they changed their name to Mountbatten in the UK. This name comes from Battenberg, a little town in Germany. In the 1800s, a part of the Hesse-Darmstadt family, which is a smaller branch of the Hesse family, got a special title called count or prince of Battenberg.\nThe Zulu royal family includes the current king, King Goodwill Zwelithini, his wives, direct children, close relatives, and male descendants from his great-grandfather, King Mpande. King Mpande ruled from 1840 to 1872. King Shaka, who was his half-brother and the Zulu leader, expanded the kingdom greatly by making it a powerful pre-colonial region in what is now KwaZulu-Natal, thanks to his policies and conquests. \nA cadet branch is like a smaller group in a family tree. It comes from the sons of a king or a leader who were born later, not the firstborn. In big families that rule or have special titles in Europe and Asia, usually, the main things like land, titles, and money are given to the firstborn son, not the younger brothers. These younger sons get less and pass it down to their own children in the future. \nThe Capetian dynasty, or House of France, is a royal family from France that started with Hugh Capet. They are one of the longest-lasting and biggest families in Europe and the world. It started when Hugh's male children continued the rule after he became king in 987. The main branch, House of Capet, ruled until 1328. Then, smaller branches, the Valois and Bourbon families, took over until the French Revolution. \nBatonishvili is a special title for royal family members in Georgia. It means child of a lord in Georgian and is given to kids and grandchildren of kings from the Bagrationi dynasty. These titles include names like Alexandre Batonishvili or Ioane Batonishvili. Any male descendant of past kings could also use this title. People would call them Most Brilliant or Most High. \nThe House of Capet, also known as the Direct Capetians or the House of France, ruled France from 987 to 1328. They were part of the Capetian dynasty, which came from the Robertians. In the 19th century, historians used the name Capetian for both the royal family and their distant relatives. They were called the third race of kings, with the Merovingians being the first and the Carolingians being the second. The name Capetian came from the name of the first king, Hugh Capet. \nThe Duke of Leuchtenberg title was given twice by Bavaria's rulers. The first time, in 1799, Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria gave it to his son Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus when he died without kids. The land then went back to his nephew, Elector Maximilian II. Later, in 1817, King Maximilian I Joseph created the title again and gave it to his daughter's husband, Eugène de Beauharnais. Eugène was related to Napoleon I, the deposed Emperor, and was made his heir in Frankfurt and Italy. After losing his other titles, King Maximilian Joseph made sure Eugène had a new title, making him the next in line to the kingdom after the royal family."}], "output": "\nThe family that Mountbatten-Windsor applies to, resulting from the European dynasty, is the royal family of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, commonly known as the House of Windsor.**"},

He secretly marries Juliet, who comes from the Capulet family, who are enemies. Romeo gets into trouble for a fight that led to Tybalt's death and had to leave. He sadly kills himself when he learns Juliet is actually dead. \nBenvolio is a character in Romeo and Juliet, a play by Shakespeare. He is the nephew of Montague and the cousin of Romeo.

He's the prince of Denmark, and his uncle, Claudius, took over the throne. Hamlet's dad, the old king, was killed, and he wants to avenge this. He's confused and unsure about how to do it, which makes him doubt his own mind. Sadly, throughout the play, Hamlet causes many deaths, including those of Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and two friends. His love, Ophelia, also dies, and his mom, Gertrude, drinks something Claudius meant for her and passes away. \nMacbeth is a play by William Shakespeare that was first performed in 1606. It shows how trying too hard for power can be harmful, both physically and mentally. It was written when James I, who supported Shakespeare's acting company, was the king. This play is special because it reflects Shakespeare's connection to the king. It was first printed in a book called the Folio in 1623, and it's one of Shakespeare's shortest plays. \nA revenge tragedy, also known as revenge drama, is a type of play from early modern England. Ashley Thorndike, in a 1902 article, defined it as a play where the main reason is revenge and the story revolves around the person seeking revenge, usually leading to the deaths of the wrongdoers. An example is Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy from the 1580s. However, scholars now believe revenge tragedies started even earlier, in the 1560s, with plays like Troas by Jasper Heywood, who translated Seneca's works at Oxford. Gorbuduc by Thomas Norton and Sackville from 1561 is also considered a revenge tragedy. Some famous plays in this genre include William Shakespeare's Hamlet and Titus Andronicus, as well as Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy. \nShakespearean tragedy refers to the type of plays written by William Shakespeare. These include most of his plays, but some of his history plays, like Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra, were considered histories because they were about real people in English history. Roman tragedies, like Coriolanus, are also about historical figures but are mostly seen as tragedies due to their foreign and ancient sources. His romances, which are a mix of comedy and tragedy, were created later and were initially published as either tragedy or comedy. After Shakespeare, a scholar named F.S. Boas suggested a fifth category called problem plays for plays that don't fit into a simple category. People still discuss the exact classifications of some of Shakespeare's plays today. \nRory Williams is a TV character played by Arthur Darvill in a show called Doctor Who.

He became famous for being part of the Sex Pistols, a very important punk rock band. He was born on May 10, 1957, and sadly passed away on February 2, 1979. \nThe Flowers of Romance was a punk band that started in 1976. It was started by two people, Jo Faull and Sarah Hall. But, they never played any shows or made any music. What makes them famous is that some of their members later became really famous themselves. These members include Sid Vicious from the Sex Pistols, Keith Levene who played with The Clash, and Palmolive and Viv Albertine who joined The Slits. Even though they never performed, they were talked about in a fanzine called SKUM, and Sid Vicious said he would be the tough guy he was.\nGlen Matlock, born in 1956, is a musician from England.

They can be natural or made in a lab and help build muscles by increasing protein in cells, especially in our muscles. They can also make a person's body more masculine, like having more body hair and a deeper voice. The word anabolic comes from a Greek word that means throwing up or building up. There are three types of hormones that affect sex, and anabolic steroids are one of them, along with estrogen and progesterone. \nAnabolic/androgenic steroids are medicines made from testosterone, a man's hormone. They help people build muscles and get stronger for looking good and doing better in sports or bodybuilding. These drugs make muscles grow faster by helping to make more proteins and stopping the body from breaking them down. Many teenagers and grown-ups use them because they can help muscles grow very quickly, not just naturally.\nDocking means cutting off an animal's tail or ears, but cropping is mostly used for ears. Tail docking is more common, but tailing is also used. People call the part of the tail where hair grows the dock because it's the living flesh. \nTensile testing, also called tension testing, is a basic test in materials science. It involves stretching a sample under controlled tension until it breaks. The information from this test helps choose materials for specific jobs, makes sure they're good, and shows how they behave under normal pressure. The test measures things like how strong a material is (ultimate tensile strength), how much it stretches (maximum elongation), and how its shape changes (reduction in area). Other properties like Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, and how it gets harder to stretch (strain-hardening) can also be found. For most regular materials, uniaxial testing is used. But for materials that have different strength in different directions, like composites or textiles, biaxial testing is needed. \nAn STOLport, or STOLPORT, is a special airport made for planes that can take off and land short, usually for smaller planes of their size. In simple words, it has a short runway, less than 5000 feet, and only accepts specific types of planes with limited fuel. In the US, they used to call such short-runway airports airports and not STOLports anymore since the 1970s. The term STOLport was not commonly used by 2008. It was mentioned for a time when a place called Biggin Hill had limited airplane access in 1986-87 because of a nearby airport. \nTrickle valves, also called vacuum valves, are used in big machines to clean up dust. They help keep the dust collector from losing air while letting the dust go out. They are cheaper than other machines that use motors to move. These valves don't need electricity to work, which makes them perfect for machines that need to be dust-free to work well, like trenchers. Trickle valves were made for this job. \nMethyltestosterone, known by brands like Agovirin and Android, is a medicine that helps make men's bodies produce more testosterone. It's used when a man doesn't have enough and for other reasons too. Some people use it to look better or perform better in sports, even though it's not as popular as other similar medicines. It was made in 1935, not long after people found out about testosterone. Even today, it's still used as a treatment. \nThe Belling-Lee connector, also called Type 9,52 in IEC 61169-2, is a special kind of radio-frequency coaxial cable connector used in Europe and Australia. It's often called a PAL antenna connector, IEC antenna connector, or simply a TV aerial plug. This connector is used to connect coaxial cables, rooftop TV antennas, amplifiers, cable systems, TVs, and even FM and DAB radios. It's one of the connectors still commonly used in everyday devices, even though there are newer ones."}], "output": "\nAnabolic/androgenic steroids.**"},

The tree is so big and strong, it looks like a giant with red flowers on it.\n\nAt night, the tree's garden is full of life, and a nightingale's song never stops. In the morning, a gray baboon and its young ones play near it. The tree's shadow even falls on a big water tank.\n\nToru Dutt, the poet, loves the tree a lot because she and her siblings had happy times under it.

They've been around since 1880 and are the first national company to do this kind of work. Their founder, John Davey, is famous for starting the study of tree surgery. They offer many services like tree and utility fixes, moving big trees, managing commercial spaces, and consulting. The company has been owned by its workers since 1979, and it's the biggest employee-owned company in Ohio and one of the 20 biggest in the whole country. They separate their work into two parts: Residential and Commercial, and Utility. \nThe Bottle tree, also known as Pachypodium lealii Welw., is a type of plant in the Pachypodium family.

Behind the beach, there's a place called Waimea Valley. The name Waimea comes from the Hawaiian word for water that is reddish. \nCharles Van Artsdalen, born on January 31, 1941, and passed away on July 18, 1979, was a famous surfer. When he was 14, he moved from Virginia to La Jolla, California. He's famous for surfing very big waves (25 feet) at places like Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach in Hawaii, and for riding waves in a special way called tube riding during the 1960s and 1970s.

It's like surfing, but without the big waves. Skimmers do cool tricks like wrapping around the wave, spinning, and jumping in the air. They start by dropping the board on the waves and use their speed to catch and ride them back to the beach. Sometimes, they also do tricks on the flat parts of the water, like in skateboarding. This sport started in California because the waves there were too strong for regular surfboards. Now, skimboarders can ride big waves and even be pulled by boats called waverunners. A professional skimboarder named Brad Domke showed off a new trick in a video. \nTow-in surfing is a way for surfers to catch bigger, faster waves using a special helper, like a boat or watercraft, instead of just paddling. This helps them go beyond the usual 30-foot waves. It's a big change in surfing and has been a major improvement. \nWaimea Canyon, often called the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, is a big canyon on the side of Kaua'i, a place in Hawaii, United States.

There's a Goat on the Roof was a fun game for kids made by Parker Brothers in 1966. \nPoleconomy is a board game created by a person from New Zealand. It came out in 1980. It's kind of like Monopoly but instead of buying and selling houses, you buy and own companies. Players try to get rich by doing business and making smart choices. They can play for any amount of time, like 2 hours, and the winner is the person with the most money from their companies, cash, or other things. The game also teaches about how the economy and government work. It's been changed a bit for different countries, and the name combines politics and economy.\nPashmina is a soft and luxurious type of wool fabric. It was first made in Kashmir, India, and that's where the name comes from, meaning Soft Gold in the local language. Pashmina shawls can easily fit through a small ring, about half an inch in diameter. People in the West started calling it cashmere because they first found it in Kashmir. The wool for Pashmina comes from four special goats: the Changthangi from Kashmir, the Malra from Kargil, the Chegu from Himachal Pradesh, and the Chyangara from Nepal. These shawls are made by hand and are very fine, with the spinning and weaving done in both Kashmir and Nepal. \nVerão Vermelho is a song by Carlos Santana from an album called Festival.

It was the first 8-cylinder engine that was affordable for most people when it was introduced in 1932. Ford designed and built it themselves, making it a big deal for the company. It was popular because people loved powerful engines during that time. The flathead V8 was in use in Ford cars and trucks until 1953, lasting longer than the Model T engine. It was even considered one of the best engines of the 20th century. It's still remembered and loved by car enthusiasts, even though there were other V8 engines that became popular later. \nFriendship Hall is a special old house in East New Market, Maryland, near the beach.

It's the main place in Wythe County. There were 8,211 people living there in 2010. The town is easy to reach because it's at a meeting point for two big roads, I-77 and I-81. During the Civil War, the town was important for travelers and was attacked twice. It's also where the wife of President Woodrow Wilson, Edith Bolling Wilson, was born. \nI-81 is a big road that goes for 855 miles. In Virginia, which is a state in the United States, this road is 324.92 miles long. That's longer than any other state's part of I-81. It's also the longest highway in Virginia. It starts at Bristol, near the Tennessee border, and ends at Winchester, near the West Virginia border.\nInterstate 40 (I-40) is a big road in the United States that starts in California and goes all the way to North Carolina. In North Carolina, it starts near a river called the Pigeon River Gorge, coming from Tennessee. It goes through many places like mountains, hilly areas, towns, busy cities, and farmland before ending in Wilmington. The whole road is 423.55 miles long, which makes it the longest highway in the state. There are other roads nearby I-40 that are also part of it, and there's a special road in Winston-Salem that goes around it. The road is called east-west, but the part from Hillsboro to Wilmington is a bit tilted to the north-south direction. \nIn New York, there are 32 highways called Interstate Highways. These roads are either entirely or partly in the state. The state's transportation group, called NYSDOT, takes care of most of them. But, they don't use the number of the highway directly. Instead, they add the letter 'I' to the number on signs and papers. This might make it seem like some numbers are the same for both highways and state routes, like I-86 and NY 86, but the 'I' tells them apart. \nExplanation: The highways in Illinois that are part of the Interstate Highway System are owned and taken care of by the state of Illinois. The group in charge of keeping these roads clean and well-maintained is the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT). There are 13 main highways and 11 helper ones in the state, covering a total of 2,248.93 miles. The longest highway in Illinois is Interstate 57, which is 358.57 miles long, while the shortest one, Interstate 41, is only 0.90 miles. \n\nRevised paragraph: The highways in Illinois that belong to the Interstate Highway System are managed by the state of Illinois. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is responsible for maintaining them. The system has 13 primary roads and 11 auxiliary ones, stretching for 2,248.93 miles. The longest highway, I-57, is 358.57 miles, while the shortest, I-41, is just 0.90 miles. There are 16 Interstate Highways in Maryland, out of which 6 are primary and 10 are auxiliary. I-95 is the longest primary at 110.01 miles, while I-81 is the shortest, at 12.08 miles. I-97, 17.62 miles long, is both the shortest primary and the shortest intrastate. I-695 is the longest auxiliary, at 51.48 miles. The shortest auxiliary is I-295, 0.80 miles. The highways, except for some parts, are taken care of by the Maryland State Highway Administration. I-595, a unsigned highway, runs as US 50 and US 301. I-170, no longer an interstate, is shown in dark gray in the list. \nWhen the Utah State Legislature started planning for more highways in Utah, they made some changes to the system. They mainly did this by deciding on route numbers 1 to 5 for future highways in the Interstate Highway System, but these changes were not seen by the public. They also made slight adjustments to some roads for state parks and institutions. Some routes were shortened, changed, or divided to give the main highways clean numbers. Since not much of the Interstate Highway System was built in Utah by 1962, these changes were mostly for future projects. Over time, more changes were made as the highways were built. In 1977, the legislature made a big change by getting rid of unused route designations. \nExplanation: The auxiliary Interstate Highways, often called three-digit ones, are extra highways within the big network of freeways in the US called the Interstate Highway System. Just like main highways, they follow all the same rules (with a few exceptions), get the same amount of money from the government (90%), and meet federal rules. \n\nRevised Paragraph: These highways, known as auxiliary Interstate Highways, are part of the bigger US Interstate System. They are similar to main highways and follow all Interstate standards, except for a few cases. They also get 90% federal funding and adhere to federal rules."}], "output": "\nThe population of the town at the intersection of Interstate Highways 77 and the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia, which is I-81, is 8,211 people, according to the passage provided.**"},

They started in the 1900s and have grown in Southern California. During a time called Prohibition, they made a lot of money by selling illegal alcohol. They were at their strongest in the 1940s and 1950s with a man named Jack Dragna, but they were not as big as the families in New York or Chicago.

They want to protect and share Italian American culture and history by teaching, making laws, and speaking up. They want to show a strong, united front to stop false things about Italian Americans and protect them from being treated unfairly. This is the only national group like theirs. \nExplanation: \n\nOperation Power Outage was a special police operation to catch and charge people from an Armenian American group called Armenian Power, who were doing illegal things in the United States. They are blamed for things like cheating in banks, kidnapping, and dealing drugs. Armenian Power, also known as AP-13, started in a neighborhood called East Hollywood 20 years ago and now has more than 200 members. They have grown from just a street gang into a big criminal group that works across the world. \nThe Sopranos is a TV show about a man named Tony Soprano, who is a boss in a pretend New Jersey mob. He's Italian-American and tries to be both a good husband and a criminal. He talks to a doctor about his problems. The show shows his family, friends, and enemies, especially his wife and a young helper, in the story. \nThe Mexican Mafia, or La eMe, is a criminal group from the United States, not Mexico. They are mostly made up of Mexican Americans and are found in prisons. The group uses the number 13 to show they are loyal to the Mexican Mafia, because M is the 13th letter of the alphabet. The Mexican Mafia is considered the strongest gang in California's prison system. There are about 155 to 300 official members and around 990 helpers who want to become full members by helping the group with illegal activities."}], "output": "\nThere isn't a direct mention of the nickname of the hitman hired by an Italian American Criminal Organization in the provided passage.

It said Mohammad Yaqub Khan gave some land near the borders to Britain, but he still had control of Afghanistan. \nThe Second Anglo-Afghan War was a fight between the British, who were in charge of India, and Afghanistan, a country ruled by Sher Ali Khan in 1878-1880. This was the second time the British tried to invade Afghanistan. The British won and Afghanistan agreed to let them have their goals. They left most of their soldiers and let the Afghan tribes run their own land but had to work with the British for foreign relations. The British promised to keep the area safe from other countries, like Russia, by not letting them control it.\nThe Emirate of Afghanistan was a place in between Central Asia and South Asia, which is now called Afghanistan. It started from the Durrani Empire when a man named Dost Mohammed Khan became the leader and started a new dynasty. The main problem during this time was a competition between Russia and the United Kingdom, both trying to be the strongest in a nearby area called Central Asia. This was also a time when European countries were getting more involved in South Asia.\n\nThe Emirate fought with a group called the Sikh Empire, but in 1842, British and Indian forces from the UK defeated and destroyed Afghanistan.

A long time ago, people from a place called Flanders started weaving wool and cotton here in the 1400s. This made Bolton famous for its textile business, and when factories started working during the big changes in the 1800s, the town grew very fast. It was the biggest cotton spinning place in the world in 1929. But, after a big war, the cotton business started to go down, and by the 1980s, it almost stopped in Bolton. \nRivington Hall Barn is right next to Rivington Hall in a place called Rivington, in Lancashire, not too far from towns like Chorley and Bolton. The barn might be from the 9th to 13th centuries, but it probably got its current look in the 16th century. In 1905, someone named Jonathan Simpson, who was connected to a rich person called Lord Leverhulme, fixed it up, changed it, and made it bigger. It's also considered very important and protected by law as a Grade II Listed building.\nThe Manor of Rivington was a land owned in Rivington, Lancashire, England way back when. Before 1212, a family called Pilkington had six parts of the land. Over time, these parts became divided. By the 1600s, the Pilkingtons at Rivington Hall had 5 out of 8 parts.

It changes the air's temperature to create energy, and can work in different ways, like Sir George Cayley's or John Ericsson's open cycle engines or Robert Stirling's closed cycle one. It's different from engines that use fuel like gasoline or steam. \nSir George Cayley, a very important English engineer, was born on December 27, 1773, and passed away on December 15, 1857. People believe he was the first person to really study flying scientifically and understand the basic rules of flight.\nElliott Stoddard created two Stoddard engines, one in 1919 and another in 1933. These engines are a type of external combustion engine that uses valves and works with a single phase gas, like hot air. The engine originally used air as its internal working fluid, but now, other gases like helium or hydrogen can be used too. \nCharles Stephen Boreham was a shearer and unionist from New Zealand. He was born on December 19, 1857, in Richmond, Tasmania, Australia. \nThe gas-generator cycle is a part of a rocket engine. It uses some propellant to create hot gas in a separate part, called a gas generator. This hot gas helps to move the engine's pumps. Then, the used gas is sent out. Because propellant is wasted, this engine is called open cycle. \nAn external combustion engine (EC engine) is a type of engine where the fuel is burned outside the engine, either through the engine wall or a heat exchanger. This heats up a working fluid inside the engine. When the fluid expands, it makes the engine move and creates energy. After that, the fluid is cooled, compressed, and reused in the engine (closed cycle), or sometimes, it's let out and new cool fluid comes in (open cycle air engine). \nA working fluid is like a helper that moves a machine. It can be either a pressurized gas or liquid, like steam in a steam engine or air in a hot air balloon. It's also used in things like hydraulic motors or cylinders, where it carries energy. In simple words, in a thermodynamic system, a working fluid is a liquid or gas that helps transfer energy. \nCeladon Leeds Daboll, from New London, Connecticut, made a special kind of foghorn called a Daboll trumpet. It was like a small engine that burned coal to heat up air. This engine put air in a tube with a reed on top, which made a loud noise when blown."}], "output": "\nThe prolific English engineer who contributed to the advent of the hot air engine through open cycle devices and died on 15 December 1857, as mentioned in the passage, is Sir George Cayley.**"},

It was called Norþhymbra rīce and was known for being the home of the Northumbrians. Later, it became part of a bigger English kingdom and turned into an earldom. The name Humber estuary shows where its land ended. \nNorthumbrian was a type of English language spoken in a place called Northumbria, which was part of a bigger kingdom called Anglian. This language, along with Mercian, Kentish, and West Saxon, is studied by modern scholars to understand Old English.\nThe Humberhead Levels is a special area in northern England by the Humber river, near the sea. It's flat and low, used to be a big lake a long time ago. It's surrounded by different types of land: to the east is hilly land called the Yorkshire Wolds, to the north is the Vale of York, and to the south is the Trent Vale. The land is made of limestone on the west side. \nSouth Ferriby is a village in England, close to the Humber Estuary. It's located 3 miles away from a bridge called the Humber Bridge. On the other side of the river, there's another village called North Ferriby. In 2011, the village had about 651 people living there. \nThe Essex dialect, a type of English spoken in some parts of Essex, is becoming less common and is mainly found in the northern and eastern areas. It's similar to both Suffolk and Norfolk dialects but has its own special features. In the 20th century, many places in Essex became more urban, and the influence of London, which has a gentler accent, grew. This London accent, called Estuary English, is more common in the southern part of the county. Because of this, younger people in rural areas often speak a more modern London accent, while the older generation still uses the traditional rural dialect. In other parts of Essex, the dialect still exists. \nFrom 1974 to 1996, Humberside was a place in Northern England where things were managed but not a big city. It was made up of parts from three nearby places: East Riding of Yorkshire, West Riding of Yorkshire, and Lindsey in Lincolnshire. The main office for the county was at County Hall in Beverley, and the biggest city was Kingston upon Hull. The area went from one side of the Humber Estuary in the north to the other in the south. Even though it's not a county anymore, it still affects the area around the Hull and Humber Ports. \nThe Cumbrian dialect, which is a type of local English spoken in Cumbria and nearby areas, is slowly disappearing. This dialect is different from the old Celtic language called Cumbric, which is no longer used. The accent in Cumbria sounds more like the North-East English one, and it also shares a lot of words with Scots. There are two books available to help understand and learn about the dialect: A Cumbrian Dictionary of Dialect, Tradition, and Folklore by William Rollinson, and a newer, funnier one called A Contemporary Cumbrian Dictionary and Phrase Book. \nThe Humber Forts are two big structures by the Humber estuary in the north of England. One is called Haile Sand Fort and the other is Bull Sand Fort."}], "output": "\nThe northern English Anglian Kingdom in the Humber estuary spoke the Northumbrian dialect of English.**"},

In 2010, there were 15,955 people living there. The main office in the county is called Liberty. Casey County was created in 1806 from a part of another county called Lincoln County. It was named for a man named William Casey, who moved his family to Kentucky in 1779. This is the only county in Kentucky that is all in a part called the Knobs. The county has an Apple Festival every year. It follows a rule called prohibition or being dry, which means no selling alcohol.

He was the main singer, guitarist, and writer for Creedence Clearwater Revival, a popular band. From 1968 to 1972, the band had many hit songs and won eight gold albums.

She played in three FIFA Women's World Cup events in 1991, 1995, and 1999 for the national team. She won a silver medal at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and also took part in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. She was a skilled player who controlled the game as a midfielder. She played in both Japan and the United States for professional clubs.\nThe Gambia's women's soccer team plays in international games, but FIFA, the main soccer body, doesn't recognize their matches. Even though they've been playing women's soccer since 1998, the country's top teams are for kids under 17 and 19. Building a national team is tough like in many African countries, but there are four people working on it. \nThe EAFF E-1 Football Championship is a soccer event in East Asia for countries in that region. It's for both men's and women's national teams, they play together. \nThe EAFF E-1 Football Championship, which used to be called the East Asian Football Championship from 2003 to 2010 and the EAFF East Asian Cup for 2013 and 2015, is a competition for men's national soccer teams in East Asia. It started in 2002 when the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) was created. Before the EAFF existed, there was a competition called the Dynasty Cup, played between the top four teams in the region, which was considered the unofficial championship. There are separate women's and men's events, and in 2005, they also had a combined points competition, where the scores from both the men's and women's teams were added together, but not including the qualifying games. \nGeri Donnelly, born on November 30, 1965, is a retired Canadian soccer player. She played as a midfielder and represented Canada in two World Cup events, in 1995 and 1999. She was recognized as the Canadian Player of the Year in both 1996 and 1999. Donnelly was a key part of the Canadian team that won the 1998 CONCACAF Women's Championship. In 2014, she was honored into the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame. \nIn the 1929-30 season, the British Home Championship, a yearly competition among British countries, took place. However, a big change happened that year. The 1930 FIFA World Cup, a major international football event, was started in Uruguay. But, the British Home Nations, who were the hosts, weren't allowed to join because they had disagreements with FIFA about the growing professionalism in football in other parts of the world. Because of this, they didn't participate and said they wouldn't even if invited, as they thought foreign teams weren't strong enough to challenge them.\n\nIt's interesting to think about what might have happened if the British teams had played in the World Cup. For example, England, who were great in the Home Championship, had already lost to Spain, and they didn't do well against Germany and Austria in the same year. Scotland, which had won most of the previous championships, wasn't ready either, as they only played outside the British Isles for the first time in 1929 and lost to strong teams like Austria and Italy in 1931 on tour. \nThe L'Alcúdia International Football Tournament in 2016 was a special soccer event for young teams only. It happened in July and August of that year. It was the first time they didn't have teams from clubs or different countries playing together in the past."}], "output": "\nThe international football competition for women that Liu Ailing played in the 1991, 1995, and 1999 editions is the FIFA Women's World Cup.**"},

The article connects the theme of parricide, which is found in famous books like Oedipus Rex and Hamlet, to Dostoevsky's work. It suggests that Dostoevsky's epilepsy might be related to this theme. In simpler terms: Freud discussed how big literary works like Dostoevsky's and others talk about killing a parent (parricide) and he connects this to Dostoevsky's health issue. \nOedipus Rex, a famous play by Sophocles from ancient Greece, was first shown around 429 BC. It's also known as Oedipus the King or Oedipus in Greek. Initially, the name didn't have a specific negative meaning. People might have called it Oedipus Tyrannus to make it clear from another play called Oedipus at Colonus. In those times, being a tyrant just meant someone in charge, not necessarily a bad person.\nThe Interpretation of Dreams is a book from 1899 by Sigmund Freud. It explains Freud's idea about dreams, which comes from his idea about the unconscious mind. The book also talks about a thing called the Oedipus complex. Freud changed the book many times and in the third edition, he added a part that looks very closely at the symbols in dreams, because of another person named Wilhelm Stekel. Freud said this was a very special and rare kind of understanding. \nFreud: A Life for Our Time is a biography about Sigmund Freud, who started psychoanalysis, written by Peter Gay, a historian. It was made in 1988 and includes information that wasn't in Ernest Jones' book from 1953. Some people like it, but others who don't believe in psychoanalysis have criticized it. \nHamlet, a play by Shakespeare, started in the 17th century and is still famous, copied, and studied a lot. It's known for a character named Hamlet who was important in understanding a thing called the Oedipus complex, which helps with understanding how people feel. This play also has a big effect on how people think about life, and many people think of Hamlet when they hear his name. Other writers also use his character as an example. \nPaul Ricœur wrote a book called Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation in 1965, which talks about Sigmund Freud. This book is sometimes put together with another book by Jürgen Habermas. Some people think it's good, but others say Ricœur didn't understand Freud correctly. \nThe book The Assault on Truth by Jeffrey Masson discusses how Sigmund Freud, a famous psychologist, didn't want to accept that children can be hurt by sexual abuse during their early years. He hid a theory he had, called the seduction theory, which said this was the cause of a condition called hysteria. Masson found this out by looking at some private letters Freud had that were not publicly known. The book first came out in 1984 and has been updated many times since. \nRichard Webster's book Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science, and Psychoanalysis (first published in 1995, updated in 1996 and 2005) is a critique of Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. The author claims that Freud became an influential figure and that psychoanalysis is not a reliable science, but rather a blend of religious beliefs. Webster uses arguments from Gilbert Ryle's book The Concept of Mind (1949) against mentalism, and he criticizes other writers for their treatment of Freud's ideas.\n\nThe book has been praised as brilliant and definitive but has also faced criticism for its lack of thorough scholarship and arguments. Why Freud Was Wrong contributed to the ongoing debate, known as the Freud wars, surrounding the validity of psychoanalysis."}], "output": "\nOedipus Rex.**"},

It was used by the city government to punish people who couldn't pay their debts. \n\nRevised paragraph: There was a simple white marble column by the Castel Capuano, near Via dei Tribunali in Naples, Italy. It served as a spot where people who owed money were punished by the government. \nPiazza Colonna is a place in the middle of Rome, Italy, close to old parts of the city.

It can only be found in a place called Endau-Rompin National Park in Johor. This toad usually appears in lowland forests near the close trees, especially in the early evening after a short rain. Its name is inspired by a character named Gollum from a book called The Lord of the Rings written by J.R.R. Tolkien. \nThe Lord of the Rings is a big and exciting story written by J.R.R. Tolkien, a smart man from England. It started as a follow-up to a book called The Hobbit, but it became much bigger. Tolkien wrote it over many years, from 1937 to 1949. It's so popular that over 150 million people have bought a copy.\nSuanfa Tongzong, written by Cheng Dawei in 1592, is a math book from the 16th century in Chinese. It has 595 problems in 17 chapters, like a big arithmetic book for the abacus. It was very important for math in China at that time. After发布6年， Cheng published another book called Suanfa Zuanyao. This new book mostly used 4 chapters from the first one, but rearranged the content. When Suanfa Tongzong was popular, people started copying it without permission and made mistakes, so the author had to make a shorter version. \nGollum is a character from a book called The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien. In the first book, he appears and later becomes important in the next book called The Lord of the Rings. Gollum used to be a simple Hobbit living near a place called the Gladden Fields. He was called Sméagol, but he got really bad and changed because of a special ring. After that, people called him Gollum because of the noise he made. \nAnthony Aguirre and Max Tegmark's idea is a way to understand quantum mechanics in a big universe that keeps growing forever. This universe has lots and lots of planets and the same thing happens with tiny systems. Instead of thinking about a wave that shows many possible situations for a system, it says there's a real group of identical copies of that system spread all over the infinite space. The uncertainty we see in quantum stuff is because we can't tell which copy of ourselves is experiencing our thoughts. \nGollum's story in the book explains how at first, Andy Serkis was asked to do a three-week voice job for Gollum in The Lord of the Rings. But this soon turned into a five-year project where he fully brought Gollum to life. Serkis talks about how he made Gollum's cough sound like a real cat's by copying its coughing noise. He also shares how he had to act out Gollum and then use special computer technology (CGI) to show it on screen. There was also a debate about whether he should have been given an award for his amazing Gollum voice acting. \nMachine Head's third album, called The Burning Red, is popular. It's their second best-selling album in the US, selling almost as many copies as their first album, Burn My Eyes, did in 8 years.

They became famous in 1997 with their song Barbie Girl. They started in 1989 and were very successful from the late 1990s to early 2000s. They made three albums: Aquarium in 1997, Aquarius in 2000, and Megalomania in 2011. They sold over 33 million songs and albums, which makes them the most successful Danish band ever. \nExplanation: Mattel and MCA Records had a legal issue in 2002. It started because of a song called Barbie Girl by Aqua, which was released in 1997. They fought in a few lawsuits, but in the end, the case was dropped or forgotten (dismissed).\nDaze is a Danish dance band known for their 1997 album Super Heroes, which became really popular, selling lots of copies worldwide. The band has three members: Lucas, Jesper, and Trine. Their music is like bubblegum dance with a fun, zany touch. They are compared to another Danish band called Aqua. Super Heroes first came out in Scandinavia and did well, selling 31,000 copies on the day. It was later released in the US and other places by different record labels. Some popular songs from the album are Superhero, Tamogotchi, and Toy Boy. In 1998, they won a Danish Grammy for the best dance album. Their song Superhero was even a hit in Argentina. Aqua, a Danish dance-pop group, made a song called 'Lollipop (Candyman)' for their album 'Aquarium.' It came after their popular song 'Barbie Girl' in many places like Australia, North America, and Europe, but it didn't do as well as those songs in the UK. Even though the group liked it, 'Lollipop' didn't have the same success as their other popular songs. \nSøren Nystrøm Rasted, born on June 13, 1969 in Denmark, is a musician, singer, and songwriter.

They also included two songs they recorded under a different name, Endless Summer and I Will Believe It.

Gibb or Reynolds v. Sims? \n\n Passage: \nReynolds v. Sims was a court case in 1964 that said, in simple words, if you want to choose people to represent your state in a group like the Senate, each group (called an electoral district) should have about the same number of people. This was because the court wanted to make sure that big cities and small towns have equal chances. The person who started the case, M.O. Sims, lived in Birmingham, Alabama, but this change affected other states in the South and North too, because they didn't follow this rule for their state legislatures. \nIn a big important case called Selle v. Gibb in 1984, the Seventh Circuit Court in the United States decided that when someone copies something, they need to show that they got it. But if there's no proof of how they got it, the court will think it's possible that the person copied because the work is too similar, like it came from the same source. However, just being very similar isn't enough to say they copied. The similarity needs to be so strong that it's impossible for the work to have been made without copying.\nWest v. Barnes, the first Supreme Court case in the United States, happened in 1791. It was the first case where the Court asked people to speak out (oral argument). A previous case, Van Staphorst v. Maryland, was planned but didn't need to be heard because it was solved before the Court started. West was actually argued and decided very quickly, on August 2 and 3. There was also a case called Collet v. Collet, but it was canceled before it got to be heard. The full opinions from West v. Barnes were not officially written by the Supreme Court reporter, but some parts were shared in newspapers. \nReynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd was a court case in England about if newspapers could say mean things about people without facing legal trouble if it was important for the public to know. \nGeorge Reynolds was a very important person in the LDS Church. He lived from January 1, 1842 to August 9, 1909. He worked closely with the top leaders of the church and was known for his role as a secretary. He also took part in a big court case in 1878 called Reynolds v. United States, which was the first time the Supreme Court talked about people's freedom to believe in their religion. \nThe Jameel vs Wall Street Journal Europe case was a decision made by the House of Lords in England. It confirmed a rule from a previous case called Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd. This decision supports having a defense for public interest in cases where someone is accused of defamation. In simpler terms, it means if someone says something true about something important in the public eye, they won't be sued for defamation. \nIn Reynolds v. United States, a court case from 1878, the Supreme Court decided that someone cannot say they were doing something because of their religious beliefs as a reason to not be punished by the law. This case was important because it was the first time the court talked about two parts of the Sixth Amendment, which are about having a fair jury and being able to face your accuser in court. \nMorrison Waite, who was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from 1874 to 1888, had a busy time with criminal cases. In just 14 years, the Supreme Court heard 106 cases, which was almost as many as they had heard before he became the Chief Justice. Some famous cases during this time include Cruikshank, Reese, Reynolds, Wilkerson, Trade-Mark Cases, and many others. These cases dealt with topics like voting rights, state laws, and individual rights."}], "output": "\nSelle v. Gibb was decided first in 1984, while Reynolds v. Sims was decided in 1964.**"},

They are similar to a manager or producer. In the past, when opera was very popular in Italy, from the 1700s to the 1830s, an impresario was the main person who made sure everything for an opera season was set up. They found the composer, the musicians, the costumes, and the theater. But they also took big risks with their money. Mozart even made a funny play about it in 1786. There was a man named Antonio Vivaldi who was both an impresario and a composer, he managed opera shows in Venice in 1714. \nVanessa Bley is a singer, composer, producer, and musician from New York and LA.

It comes from mountains in Asia, North America, and Cuba. In North America, people call it andromedas or fetterbushes. These shrubs have green leaves that are spiral-shaped and usually have a pointy edge. In spring, the leaves can be bright colors. The flowers are like small bells, 5 inches long, and come in white or pink. They grow in groups called racemes. When the shrub is done blooming, it has a hard, fruit-like thing called a capsule that opens to share lots of tiny seeds. \nPhlebodium is a small group of ferns with around 2-4 members, found mainly in tropical and subtropical Americas. Before, these ferns were considered part of the Polypodium genus.\nSinopieris is a type of butterfly found in places like Nepal, Tibet, Yunnan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan. These butterflies used to be part of a group called Pieridae. There's a simple way to tell them apart: Sinopieris have a grey or black band near the wing's top, while Pieridae butterflies usually have one or two black spots, and no band, on their forewings, and no spots on the hindwings. \nThe andromeda lace bug, a pest for Pieris plants, especially the Japanese andromeda (Pieris japonica), originally came from Japan. It has spread to other parts of the world. Luckily, Pieris floribunda, another species, is immune to this bug. \nLeptosporangiate ferns are a big group of ferns with about 11,000 species found all over the world. They belong to a group called Polypodiidae, but some people think they are part of a bigger group called Pteridopsida or Polypodiopsida. These ferns are one of the four main types, along with others like marattioid ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns and moonworts. \nPieris floribunda is a type of green, evergreen shrub from North America. It's part of the fetterbush group and is called mountain fetterbush or mountain andromeda. But, be careful - all its parts can be harmful if you eat them. It's not easy to grow in gardens, so it's rare. Some nurseries that specialize in native plants do have it for sale, even though it's hard to grow. If you have it in your yard, plant it in partial shade, away from strong winds, and use soil that's acid with pH 4.5 to 6.5. \nPieris, also known as garden whites, is a type of butterfly in the Pieridae family that can be found almost anywhere. They have the most species in the Palearctic region. These butterflies have caterpillars that mainly eat plants from the Brassicaceae family, like cabbage. For over 100 years, scientists have studied why they like these plants. They discovered that the butterflies have special ways to handle the chemicals called glucosinolates found in Brassicaceae. These caterpillars can't eat anything without glucosinolates, and the female butterflies choose plants with these chemicals before laying eggs.\n\nSome Pieris species can be pests because they have spread to many parts of the world, including South America and Africa, and cause damage to crops. However, there are also non-pest species like Pieris oleracea and Pieris virginiensis in North America that only feed on native plants. \nThe Indian cabbage white, also known as Pieris canidia, is a butterfly in the Pieridae family. Pieris rapae is very similar and is also a member of the same family. \n\nExplanation: \n1. Simplified the first sentence to directly state the butterfly's name and family.\n2. Mentioned Pieris rapae as a close species instead of one of the closest, making it easier to understand without using technical terms."}], "output": "\nNo, Phlebodium and Pieris are not both species of ferns.

It was built in 1889 to connect Clara Barton Road over the French River. The person who asked for it, Edwin Bartlett, owned mills and needed a better road for his workers. The bridge is 30 feet long, 42 feet wide, and has a big arch that's 13 feet high. The outside is made of big, not smooth, granite blocks and the arch is very nicely shaped. There are big, 4.5 feet wide, 2 feet thick slabs on the sides to keep people safe. \nWorcester is a city in Massachusetts, USA, where people live. It's the second biggest city in New England after Boston. It's about 40 miles from Boston, 50 from Springfield, and 40 from Providence. The city is called the Heart of the Commonwealth because it's in the middle of the state. There's also a story that says the first Valentine's Day card was made here, so a heart is the city's special symbol.\nThe Sutliff Bridge is a bridge in Sutliff, a place near Lisbon, Iowa. It was made in 1897 and 1898 by a company called Parker, and it cost around $12,000. The engineer for the bridge was J.R. Sheely. In 1983, a new bridge was built, and the old one was almost taken down, but it became special and was put on a list of historic places in 1998. Sadly, in 2008, during big floods, the bridge was damaged and one part was gone.修复这个桥需要170万美元, and both FEMA (a government group) and local leaders同意帮忙. A company from Iowa fixed the bridge, and in 2012, they had a big event to celebrate its reopening. \nThe Gardnerville Branch Jail is a special old jail in Gardnerville, Nevada. It was built in 1910 and was the only jail for Douglas County from 1910 to 1915. Before that, the jail was in a place called Genoa, which was the main town. But Gardnerville was far from Genoa, so they kept prisoners in a judge's grain storage building. The people in Gardnerville wanted a better jail, so they asked the county. But some people in Minden, who wanted to be the county's new main town, didn't like it. But the county still said yes and built the new jail. The jail was even used before it was fully finished because the old jail in Genoa caught fire. One person had to wait and be tied to a post until the new jail was ready. After it was done, the jail served the county until Minden became the main jail in 1915. \nThe Cerro Gordo County Courthouse is in Mason City, Iowa. It was chosen as the county's main place in 1855 when Cerro Gordo County was made. Some people in the western part of the county were unhappy and asked the government to move the county seat to Livonia. They built a courthouse there. However, most people in Mason City wanted it back, and in 1858, they voted to keep it as the county seat. Mason City had two courthouses before the modern one that the county started using in 1960. This building used to be a Standard Oil Building and cost $159,400 to buy and change for the county's use. \nThe Old Allamakee County Courthouse, which was once a courthouse in Lansing, Iowa, was built in 1861. There was a disagreement between Lansing and Waukon about which town should be the county's main office. Lansing won a vote in 1861 by joining forces with Columbus. However, Waukon built its own courthouse but didn't win again in 1864. In 1866, the sheriff from Waukon tried to take the county records from Lansing but was stopped. The Iowa Supreme Court finally decided in 1867 that Waukon would be the county seat, and it has stayed there ever since. \nThe Henry Covered Bridge, located near Bartlett, Ohio, is a special old bridge. It's like a roofed walkway and can be found off a road called OH550, not too far away, near a place called Washington County. This bridge is a unique type called a Multiple Kingpost truss and is 45 feet long. It was built in 1894, which means it's very old. \nThe Shinn Covered Bridge is a special old bridge in Ohio, near a place called Bartlett. It's in a field near the woods, and was built in 1886 by a carpenter named Charles Shinn. The bridge is made of wood, has a roof made of metal, and has straight sides.

He wrote books too and was involved with the Communist Party. He was also a member of a special group called the Académie Goncourt.\nThe Murree Rebellion in 1857 was a small part of a bigger event called the Indian Rebellion. It happened when some people living near a hill station called Murree in Pakistan didn't like being ruled by the British in India. They had been unhappy with the British for a long time and had had small fights before. In 1857, these fights felt like they might be part of a bigger plan to end British rule completely. \nThe constitution of Niger, from 1999, promises to protect many human rights as listed in a big rule book called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, some people and groups from both inside and outside the country are worried about how the government, military, and police are treating people. They also mention that some old traditions, which don't match the constitution, are still practiced. Before 1999, when Niger was ruled by France, people didn't have many rights and the government could do whatever it wanted. Even though things have gotten better since then, there are still complaints about human rights in the country. \nIn 1985, Hong Kong changed the way they chose their representatives in the government during the time when Britain was still in control. Before this, they had never done indirect elections like this before. The plan to change was announced in a paper called The Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong in July 1984. This happened right before a big agreement called the Sino-British Joint Declaration in December. This change started a new system of democracy in Hong Kong and continued to grow until Hong Kong was given back to China in 1997. \nLes Chansons d'Aragon is a music album by Léo Ferré, made in 1961 by Barclay Records. It's the second album he made where he sings about a poet, inspired by Louis Aragon.

Before European rule, the island was controlled by three different kingdoms. During the time of the Portuguese and Dutch, these kingdoms were each governed separately. When the British took over, they combined the whole island into one big government. After gaining independence, the minority Tamils were left in a difficult situation because they were part of a group that had been fighting with the majority before the Europeans came. A person named Jonathan Spencer, from a university in Edinburgh, believes that the war is a result of how the country's different ethnic groups have formed their identities since colonial times. The conflict includes arguments over history and where things came from, as well as the government's actions towards the Tamil minority. \nFort Diu is a place on the west coast of India in a place called Diu, which is a part of the country managed by the Indian government. The fort was made by the Portuguese when they controlled the island. There is a town called Diu near the fort. The fort was built in 1535 because two groups, Bahadur Shah and the Portuguese, made an agreement to protect each other. The fort got stronger over time. The Portuguese ruled for 424 years, from 1537 until 1961. But in 1961, the Indian government asked them to leave because of a military action called Operation Vijay. After that, Diu became a part of India and is now a special area under the central government's control."}], "output": "\nJ. G.

The name desert kites came from pilots who first spotted them in the 1920s.\n\nThere are about 2,000 of these structures identified in Jordan and Syria, but not much is known about them in Saudi Arabia. Researchers have found that they were mainly used to hunt a specific type of gazelle that disappeared in the Southern Levant in the 19th century. The kites are estimated to be around 3,000 to 5,000 years old, with older dates being disproven by more recent studies. The younger age suggests that these hunts took place after people started farming, not during prehistoric times.\n\nSome rock art near the kites suggests that these hunts might have been big community events, involving people from multiple settlements and possibly having religious significance. \nThe 2000 Race of a Thousand Years was a long race in the American Le Mans Series, held on December 31, 2000, at the Adelaide Street Circuit in Australia.

It's about a man named Miles, who is a reporter, and he goes to a faraway hospital in the mountains to find out more. The extra part, Outlast: Whistleblower, is about the person who sent Miles there, named Waylon Park. \nJ.T. Petty, born on February 28, 1977 in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a filmmaker and video game writer. His work often includes scary elements.

The most common type, found worldwide and in developing countries, is cervical cancer, which comes from the bottom part of the uterus. Endometrial cancer, affecting the inside lining, is the second most common and the fourth in developed countries.\n\nRisk factors for uterine cancer include being overweight, getting older, and having an infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). At first, there might not be any symptoms, but later, some might experience changes like abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or feeling full.\n\nIf caught early, most uterine cancers can be treated with surgery or medical methods. If the cancer has spread, more advanced treatments like a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery might be needed. \nPetty treason was a minor offense where someone under a leader, like an employee, secretly harmed or betrayed their boss. It was different from high treason, which only happened when someone tried to harm the King or Queen. In England and Wales, in 1828, petty treason and murder became the same kind of crime. In Ireland, this was stopped in 1829, and it never happened in Scotland. In other countries that used common law, petty treason was also removed as a separate offense. In simple words, a petit jury is a group of people who listen to both the person saying they're hurt (the plaintiff) and the person they're accusing (the defendant) in a court case. After hearing everything, they discuss and try to decide if the defendant is guilty or not. The rules for deciding are different in some places - some need everyone to agree, while others need a majority. If they can't agree, they're called a hung jury. The number of people on the jury can be 12 in criminal cases in most places, but in Scotland, it's 15. In some countries, they have a mix of lay judges and professional judges to help decide, but the common law trial jury is the most common way. \nTreason means betraying your country. In the past, in places like the UK, they had two types: high treason, which was against the whole country, and low treason, also called petit treason.

Some people also think that these winners might not have good careers in the NFL or might not play at all. However, not all Heisman winners are unsuccessful - some, like Barry Sanders and Charles Woodson, are actually very successful in the NFL. \nKurt Burris, born on June 27, 1932 and passed away on July 21, 1999, was a famous American football player.

He was known for creating designs in the Mid-Century modern style and was one of the first designers to bring Scandinavian design to the United States. \nScandinavian design, which started in the 1950s, is about simple, clean, and useful designs. It comes from five countries in Northern Europe: Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark. Even though Scandinavia usually means Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, people often use it to talk about all five countries together.\nCharles Lim, the founder of Peliontech, created a new term called Workflow Resource Planning (WRP) in 2003. This was to describe a new kind of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. Most ERP software simply helps with data entry and processing. But Lim changed this by adding workflow features to the core of his WRP software, which he called Radix ERP. Workflow, where tasks are organized and managed, was already known, but it was mainly used in a program called Lotus Notes before it became less popular in 2000. Mr. Lim took the concept from Lotus Notes and combined it with ERP systems to create Radix WRP, a new type of ERP that makes workflow management easier. \nExplanation: An NTFS symbolic link, or symlink, is like a special kind of file that points to another file or folder in the NTFS file system. When you see a symlink, it looks like a normal file or directory, but it actually leads to the target file or folder. NTFS introduced these links starting with version 3.0 in Windows 2000, especially for directories and volumes. From version 3.1, you can create symlinks for any file type. However, at first, this feature was not available in regular programs. Some third-party drivers, like Masatoshi Kimura's, made it work in user mode. Windows Vista made it possible for user mode applications to use this feature right out of the box. \nJens Ritter Instruments is a company that makes special electric guitars and basses. It was started by a man named Jens Ritter in the 1990s. He only made basses at first, but in 2010, he started making guitars too. He makes around 50 to 60 instruments every year in a small town called Deidesheim, Germany. Some famous bass players, like Phil Lesh, Josh Dunham, and Doug Wimbish, use his instruments. These instruments are unique, fancy, and not many are available. They also sell strings and other stuff to go with them. \nBio-inspired robotic locomotion is a new area in design that takes ideas from nature and applies them to create real-life robots. It's about making robots that look and work like living creatures. Biomimicry, which is copying nature, and bio-inspired design, which learns from nature and makes things simpler and better, are often mixed up. Biomimicry has led to soft robotics, a part of robotics that uses soft materials.\n\nNature's creatures have evolved to do specific tasks in their environment, often being multifunctional. Bio-inspired robotics is about understanding these natural systems and finding ways to use their mechanisms in engineering. Designers study things like eyes (biosensors), muscles (bioactuators), or strong materials (like spider silk) to create better robots.\n\nMany robots have systems to move, so this article will talk about different ways animals move and show some examples of robots inspired by those movements. \nIn US trademark law, the functionality rule stops companies from using trademarks to protect the special parts of a product. There are two parts to this rule: one for practical features that help the product work (utilitarian) and the other for making the product look nice (aesthetic). This rule exists because if new companies could copy these features, it wouldn't make the market fair. Practical features are protected by patent law, not trademarks, because they are useful. Design features that just make the product look good are handled by copyright, which protects artistic creations. \nJackie Winsor, born in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1941, is a sculptor from Canada turned American. Her art style, created in the 1970s, was a reaction against minimal artists. It's known as post-minimal, anti-form, and process art. Her work connects minimalism with feminism, using simple geometric shapes and symmetrical forms, but instead of using industrial materials, she often uses natural, handmade materials like wood and hemp."}], "output": "\nBio-inspired robotic locomotion.**"},

It started being built in 1962 and opened in 1965. It was used for different sports like baseball, football, and basketball. The Houston Astros played baseball there from 1965 to 1999, the Houston Oilers played football from 1968 to 1996, and the Houston Rockets played basketball part-time from 1971 to 1975. It was also the main place for the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo from 1966 to 2002. At first, it was called the Harris County Domed Stadium and people called it the Eighth Wonder of the World. \nExplanation: The Eighth Wonder of the World is a nickname given to impressive buildings, structures, projects, or designs that people think are as great as the seven well-known Wonders of the Ancient World. It's not a formal title but a way to recognize their remarkableness.\nExplanation: George Strait's first live album, titled For the Last Time: Live From the Astrodome, was released in 2003. This album is special because it captures a concert that happened at the Houston Astrodome, which was the venue's last event before it closed down. \n\nRevised passage: In 2003, George Strait shared his live music with fans in For the Last Time: Live From the Astrodome, a album marking the final concert held at the now-closed Houston Astrodome. \nSelena, an American singer, had a live concert called Live! The Last Concert that was recorded on February 26, 1995, at the Houston Astrodome. It was shown on a TV channel called Univision. The album came out after she passed away on March 31, 2001. During the concert, she performed with another singer named Emilio Navaira, and together they played in front of 66,994 people, which broke a record. People really liked the concert and thought it was better than concerts by country singers like Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, and George Strait. This was her last concert on TV before she died. \nOn December 29, 1973, a football game called the Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl happened. It was a part of the 1973 bowl game season. The game was played in a big stadium in Houston, Texas, called the Houston Astrodome. Two teams, Tulane Green Wave and Houston Cougars, played in the game. Both teams didn't belong to any specific college team. Houston won the game with a score of 47 to 7. \nEighth Wonder, a British pop group, released their first album called Fearless in 1988. This album is their only one in the UK and has fast, upbeat songs. It has six songs that were released in the UK, with one, I'm Not Scared, produced by the Pet Shop Boys and became very popular, reaching #7 on the charts. Another song, Cross My Heart, also did well, reaching #13. Fearless did not sell as well as expected, reaching #47 on the UK Albums Chart. The group disbanded in 1989, and the lead singer, Patsy Kensit, started acting instead. \nThe Shreveport Steamer was a football team in the World Football League. They started in 1974 in Houston, Texas, but didn't really belong to the Houston Texans we know today. They played in a big stadium called the Houston Astrodome. Later, they moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, and changed their name to the Shreveport Steamer. They played at a stadium called Independence Stadium, which could hold 30,000 people. \nIn 1965, the Houston Astros started playing in a new place called the Houston Astrodome, and it was their first season with this name. Before that, they were called the Colt .45s for three years. During this season, the Astros did not do very well, finishing ninth in the National League with 65 wins and 97 losses. They were 32 games behind the Los Angeles Dodgers, who won the World Series that year. The person in charge of the team was Lum Harris."}], "output": "\nThe Houston Astrodome was called the Eighth Wonder of the World subjectively because it was seen as an impressive and innovative structure during its time. It was the first stadium with a dome, which was a significant engineering achievement, and it hosted various events like sports, concerts, and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo. Its unique design and its role in popularizing indoor sports made it stand out among other sports venues.

When we look at light, blue light is between 450 and 495 tiny parts called nanometres. Blue with shorter wavelength (more like violet) has higher frequency, and the other end, green, has longer wavelength with lower frequency. Pure blue has a wavelength of 470 nanometres. In art, blue is one of three main colors, along with red and yellow, which can make many more colors when mixed together. Red and blue make purple, and blue and yellow make green. Blue is also a key color in something called RGB, which helps make all the colors on a TV or computer screen. \nInnocent Records was a pop music label started by Virgin Records to have more pop acts. After the Spice Girls became popular, Virgin wanted to focus on pop too. They got a man named Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records, who helped Take That become a big hit. He started a new Virgin label called Innocent. They signed famous people like Billie Piper and Martine McCutcheon, as well as dance groups. The label did well until the mid-2000s with groups like Atomic Kitten and Blue selling a lot of albums.\nThe ProPhoto RGB color space, called ROMM RGB, is a special color space made by Kodak for pictures. It has a very wide range of colors, perfect for printing photos. It can show almost all the colors in the world, even the ones we see every day, and it also helps to keep the colors true to their original hue. However, not all the colors it can represent are real colors we can see - about 13% of them are not visible. \nThe YCoCg color model is a way to change an RGB color into three simpler parts: Y for brightness, Cg for green color, and Co for orange color. It's used in things like video and picture compression because it's easy to work with, helps save space, and can be converted losslessly with fewer bits compared to other color systems. It's found in popular formats like H.264 and JPEG XR. \nA color space is like a way to organize colors, both in real and digital pictures. It helps to make sure everyone sees the same color the same way. Some color spaces use special color swatches and names (like Pantone), while others use math (like RGB or CMYK). A color model is a way to represent colors using numbers, but it's not real until we connect it to a specific color space. A color space is created by connecting a color model to a reference color space, like CIELAB or CIEXYZ, which covers all the colors people can see. Adobe RGB and sRGB are two examples of color spaces based on the RGB model. \nHCL combines features of two color systems, HSL and HSV, which are like cylindrical translations of the RGB color space. These systems are easy to understand because they change RGB colors in a way that people find consistent. However, they don't exactly match how we see brightness. There's another system called L*a*b* that's based on how our eyes see colors, but it can be confusing because the blue part isn't as consistent. In noisy situations, a color system that matches how we see better can perform better than RGB. \nRGBA is short for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It's not a separate color space, but rather uses the RGB color model with an extra part called the alpha channel. This alpha value allows for special effects called alpha compositing. The alpha value comes from a Greek letter used in a math formula to mix colors. \nBrown is a color that comes from mixing other colors. In printing or painting, brown is made with red, black, and yellow, or red, yellow, and blue. On TVs and computers, brown is made from red and green. It's often found in nature, like wood, soil, hair, and skin. Brown can be dark wood or soil color. Surveys show that most people don't like brown, associating it with being plain, country-like, dirty, and poor."}], "output": "\nThe album by the group Blue that achieved Platinum sales and shares its name with a primary color in the RGB color model is \"Blue.\"**"},

Javier gutierrez did an Italian model and actress star in? \n\n Passage: \nMatilda Lutz, born on January 28, 1991, is an actress and model from Italy. She acted in the 2017 horror movie called Rings. \nRings is a 2017 horror movie made in America. It's about ghosts and mystery, directed by F. Javier Gutiérrez, written by some writers, and has actors like Matilda Lutz, Alex Roe, and Johnny Galecki. It's the third movie in a series called The Ring, and it comes after a movie from 2002.\nPhilip Sidney's poem, Astrophil and Stella, was written in the 1580s. It's a group of sonnets with 108 sonnets and 11 songs. The title comes from two words, 'aster' (star) and 'phil' (lover) and 'stella' meaning star. The main character, Astrophil, is like a star lover, and Stella is his love interest. Sidney took ideas from an Italian poet named Petrarch, but made them more English. He tells a story that's a little hard to understand and talks about love, desire, and making poetry.

It was made to close down many big psychiatric hospitals and replace them with services that people can use in their community, like short-term care centers. This law, named after the person who suggested it, Dr. Franco Basaglia, was important and made Italy's mental health system different. In 1998, everything related to state psychiatric hospitals was finished, and other countries started using Italy's ideas for their own mental health reforms.

It tells the story of Edith, who was the wife of King Harold Godwinson, and her walk from Waltham Abbey, where her husband is buried, to a place close to the Battle of Hastings in 1066. The film has people like writers Alan Moore and Iain Sinclair, singer Claudia Barton, and musician Jem Finer who added to it. \n\nRevised paragraph: Edith Walks is a 2017 documentary about a made-up journey by Edith, the wife of King Harold Godwinson. The movie takes her from Waltham Abbey, where Harold is buried, to a place near the battle of Hastings in 1066. The film has contributions from famous writers, a singer, and a musician. \nThe Waltham Holy Cross and St Lawrence Church in Waltham Abbey, Essex, England has been a place to pray since the 7th century. The current church, built mostly in the early 12th century, has Norman architecture. To the east, there are signs of a big addition made in the 12th century after the abbey was rebuilt in 1177. In the past, the church was one of the biggest in England and many people came to visit as a place of pilgrimage. It remained a functioning church until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540.\nTostig Godwinson, who lived from 1026 to 1066, was a leader in Anglo-Saxon times. He was the brother of King Harold. Tostig was not on good terms with his brother and left to help the Norwegian king, Harald Hardrada, when he came to England. Sadly, Tostig died during a big fight called the Battle of Stamford Bridge. \nEdith the Fair, also known as Edith Swanneck, was the first wife of King Harold Godwinson. She got her name, Swanneck, which sounds like swan neck but was actually misinterpreted as Gentle Swan in Old English. People sometimes mix her with Ealdgyth, who was the queen during Harold's rule and had a different origin. She lived around 1025-1086. \nEasy version: There are stories about Harold Godwinson's short time as king of England that were made up, like a play by Alfred Tennyson in 1876 and a book by Edward Bulwer-Lytton in 1848. Rudyard Kipling also wrote a short story in 1910 where an old King Harold meets Henry I and passes away. \nLast English King is a book written by Julian Rathbone, a British author, in 1997. It's about a man named Walt Edwinson, who was a servant of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England. The story begins with Walt returning to his home in Dorset four years after the big battle at Hastings. He left England after the Anglo-Saxons lost and traveled a lot, visiting places like Europe and Asia Minor. The book also tells his story, including how he traveled from Constantinople to Side and shares his memories of the time before the battle when he helped with William of Normandy's attack on Dinan. \nLeofwine Godwinson was a younger brother of King Harold, who was the fifth child of Earl Godwin. He was born around 1035 and died on October 14, 1066. \nThe Battle of Stamford Bridge happened in a place called Stamford Bridge, in England, on September 25, 1066. It was between two groups: one led by King Harold Godwinson, the English king, and the other led by King Harald Hardrada and his brother Tostig, who were from Norway. Sadly, both Hardrada and Tostig plus many Norwegians lost the battle. Even though Harold won, he lost to the Normans at another big fight (at Hastings) just a few weeks later. People often think this battle marks the end of the Viking Age, but there were more Viking attacks in England and Ireland later, like in 1069-1070 by King Sweyn of Denmark and in 1098-1103 by King Magnus of Norway."}], "output": "\nHarold Godwinson is buried in Waltham Abbey, Essex, England.**"},

It joins three bigger branches and flows through parts of Tennessee, Virginia, and North Carolina in the northeast. When it meets the French Broad River in Knoxville, it becomes part of the Tennessee River. \nA long hunter was an 18th-century person who explored and hunted in the American wilderness for 6 months. Historian Emory Hamilton says they were unique to a place called Southwest Virginia, not anywhere else. These hunters didn't start everywhere, but mostly from the Holston River Valley and Clinch River Valley in Virginia. They usually went on these trips from October to April, in groups of 2-3 people.\nThe Thái Bình River is the main river in Northern Vietnam that comes from the Thái Bình river system. Together with another river, it helps form the Red River Delta by carrying sediment. \nThe blackback barb, a type of fish, comes from Africa. It lives in rivers with shallow, growing plants, like the Zambezi, Cunene, and part of Congo. This fish can grow up to 7 centimeters long. \nThe Red River system is a group of rivers near the main Red River in Vietnam. These rivers either get water from or add to the main river. When the Red River combines with the Thái Bình river from the northeast, it forms the Red River Delta, which is the second biggest delta in the country. The Red River and Thái Bình rivers are often called the Red and Thai Binh rivers system together. The Red River system's deposits make the central and southern parts of the delta. There's a big system of dykes protecting both sides of the rivers. \nThe Cotter River System, which started in 1912, is in a place called the Australian Capital Territory in Australia. It's part of a big park called Namadgi National Park. This river is important because it gives water to the area, and there's another river called the Queanbeyan River nearby that also provides water. But because of dry weather, people now think the Cotter River System is more important than the Queanbeyan River for water supply. \nThe Zambezi River System Action Plan (ZACPLAN) is a plan made by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to help countries like Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe use and manage the Zambezi River system better. This plan is for eight countries because they all use water from the Zambezi River basin. The goal is to work together and fairly share the water resources to meet both national and international needs. The plan comes from a UN group because the big Zambezi River and its smaller rivers will need more water in the future, but not everyone is using it well and fairly. \nThe Pearl River, also known as Zhujiang, is a big river in southern China. Sometimes, it's called the Canton River. People also use Pearl River to talk about the Xi, Bei, and Dong rivers in Guangdong, because they all flow into the same place, called the Pearl River Delta. The whole system, including these three rivers, is the third longest in China, after the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and the second biggest by volume. The Pearl River Basin, which covers a large area, includes parts of Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi, and also some parts of neighboring Vietnam."}], "output": "\nThe Holston River.**"},

The dress had a long train with her and Andrew's initials on it, and there were pretty flowers and head decorations too. Sarah loved the dress so much that she lost weight for it. The dress became very popular and was the most wanted style of that season. \nKrajmir was a Serbian nobleman who worked for Prince Lazar from 1373 to 1389. He held the title of vojvoda, like a general. He is remembered for being with Lazar during the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, where they were both captured and killed by the Ottomans. Krajmir was from Toplica. There is a connection between him and a person named Krajko, who might be the son of Jovan Oliver, a rich man from that time. Some believe Krajmir might be the same person as Milan Toplica from stories people tell. \nThe Royal Marriages Act from 1772 was a law in Britain that said who in the royal family could marry. It was made to stop marriages that might make the royal family look less important. Some people didn't like this because it let the king or queen say no to a marriage. In 2015, this rule was changed because of an agreement. Now, only the first six people in line for the throne (like Prince Charles and his kids) have these special marriage rules. \nIn the 21st century, Canada's royal tours continue a tradition that has been going on for 300 years. These tours can happen for official reasons, like visiting or meeting Canadians, for work, as a vacation, or for military service. At first, these were big events with lots of pride and excitement. But later, they started to have a special meaning, like in 2005 when Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip went to Saskatchewan and Alberta to celebrate The Spirit of Nation Builders. Younger members of the royal family also started going on tours without the government's help, sometimes called working tours. People like Prince Charles, Anne, Andrew, Edward, and Sophie have all done these smaller tours to visit places in Canada that were sponsored by provinces, cities, and other groups. \nJohn Hartmann, born on October 24, 1830 in Auleben, was a Prussian musician who composed music for brass instruments. He is famous for being the bandmaster for Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who was part of the British army's 4th Regiment and 12th Lancers. He later passed away in Liverpool, England in 1897."}], "output": "\nPrivate Secretary and Treasurer.**"},

The movie was made by two people, Alberto Arce and Mohammad Rujailahk.\nThe North African elephant, also known as the Loxodonta africana pharaoensis, was a special kind of elephant that lived in North Africa near the Sahara. They were big enough to be used as war elephants during big fights between Carthage and Rome. However, they disappeared a long time ago, around the time of the Romans. Some scientists think they might be a separate species, but not everyone agrees. People have also called them the North African forest elephant, Carthaginian elephant, or Atlas elephant. They originally lived in a wide area, from North Africa all the way down to the countries of Sudan and Eritrea. \nKhan Kluay is a Thai movie from 2006. It's a 3D animation film about a young elephant who leaves his mom and ends up working for the king during a time called Ayutthaya in Siam. The movie is based on a story by Ariya Jintapanichkarn. In other names, it was shown as Jumbo in India and The Blue Elephant in the US. There's a follow-up movie called Khan Kluay 2.

He was a pretty important person and got a special title, Lieutenant-Colonel, and was recognized three times for his bravery. In 1945, he even got a medal called the OBE. \nThere was a war elephant named Surus in Hannibal Barca's army in Italy. People think Surus was a big elephant from Asia, maybe with one tusk. Some writers say it might have come from India because the Ptolemies, who were helpers of Alexander the Great, took elephants from there in Syria. Surus might have been the last elephant Hannibal had during his big trip across the Alps in 218 BC during a war with Rome, called the Second Punic War. \nHannibal Brooks is a funny movie from 1969 made in Britain. It was directed by Michael Winner and written by Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement. The story is based on real events during World War II when a prisoner tries to escape from Germany to Switzerland with an elephant. The main actors are Oliver Reed, Michael J. Pollard, and Wolfgang Preiss. The movie is inspired by a real person, Tom Wright, who worked at a zoo in Germany while a prisoner and took care of an elephant named Lucy. It's also said to be inspired by a true story of an elephant named Olga who was rescued in 1944.

It's close to sand, mud, and small rocks and covers around 174,000 square miles in eight states. It was named by a geologist in 1898 because it's found near a place called Ogallala, Nebraska. This water source is part of a bigger system called the High Plains Aquifer System, and it sits on top of the Ogallala Formation, which makes up most of the High Plains. \nOgallala is a place in Nebraska, called a city, with 4,737 people living there. It's the main place in Keith County. A long time ago, this place was important for the Pony Express and later for the train that went across the whole country. The water underground there is named after the city too.\nKeystone is a small community in Nebraska, located in the center of Keith County. It's close to the North Platte River, not far from the main city, Ogallala, which is the county's administrative center.

It's at a height of 3,100 feet above sea level. \nSouris Beach Provincial Park is a place to visit during the day in Prince Edward Island, Canada, close to a town called Souris. The beach is really flat, so you can walk a long way without getting deep, just on sand. That's why the water here is warmer than at other beaches on the island where the water gets deeper quickly because of the sun's heat. \nDune Dam is a big sand hill at the end of Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. It was made by sand moving from the Chaco River. This sand hill stopped a little lake from growing bigger by blocking the Chaco Wash. People who lived here a long time ago, called the Ancestral Puebloans, noticed the lake went away around 900 CE. They fixed it by putting rocks around the lake in the early 1100s. This helped the land be good for farming. Some scientists think the idea that the lake caused the water level to rise might not be true because there wasn't a big lake area behind the dam. \nKingsley Dam is a big dam on Lake McConaughy, in the middle of Keith County, Nebraska. It's the second biggest of its kind in the world. It was made during the New Deal project. The dam is 162 feet tall, as long as 3.1 miles, and as wide as 1,100 feet at the bottom. On one side, there's Lake Ogallala, and on the other, there's a power plant. The place where the water goes out, called the Outlet Tower, is also there.

He was a scholar, a Sufi mystic, a poet, and a philosopher from Andalusia, which is a place in Spain. People who follow Sufism, which is a deep form of Islam, think of him as the best teacher and a holy man. He lived from 1165 to 1240. \nMahbub ul Haq, a Pakistani man, was a smart person who knew a lot about money and how to help countries grow. He was a minister in Pakistan for a few years, from 1985 to 1988, taking care of the country's money and economy. He was born on February 24, 1934, and passed away on July 16, 1998.\nIdrees Ul Haq, whose full name is Mirza Mohammad Idrees ul Haq Beigh, is a person from Kashmir who comes up with new ideas and helps others. In 2005, the leader of Jammu and Kashmir gave him a special prize for his good work. But, in 2017, he stopped the prize because of a sad event called the Ramban firing. He was the first young person from Jammu and Kashmir to be asked to join a program in Israel that helps with new technology. \nInge Kaul is a teacher at a school in Berlin, Germany that helps governments figure out how to solve big problems together. She knows a lot about things like how countries work together to pay for important things, partnerships between public and private groups, and how to improve global rules. She used to be in charge of important reports for the United Nations Development Programme, where she worked with someone named Mahbub ul Haq. She wrote many books about these topics and how to handle global issues in finance. \nAkbariyya is a type of Sufi philosophy inspired by the teachings of Ibn Arabi, a famous Sufi and philosopher from Andalusia. His nickname, Shaykh al-Akbar, is where the term comes from. It's important to note that Akbariyya doesn't specifically refer to a group or society, but rather all Sufis who follow his ideas about the concept of Unity in Sufi doctrine called Wahdat al-Wujud. There's also a separate secret Sufi society called Al Akbariyya founded by a Swedish Sufi named 'Abdu l-Hadi Aguéli, but that's a different thing. \nThe Journal of Human Development and Capabilities is a simple magazine for learning about how people grow and develop. It's written by experts and checked by others to make sure it's good. It's from a group called Routledge and comes from a bigger group called the Human Development and Capability Association. They started it in 2000 under the name Journal of Human Development and changed the name in 2009. The first people in charge were Khadija Haq, Richard Jolly, and Sakiko Fukuda-Parr from different places like the Mahbub ul Haq Human Development Center, Institute of Development Studies, and the United Nations Development Programme. \nThe HDI is a simple way to compare countries based on three main things: how long people live, how much they learn, and how much money they have. It ranks countries into four groups. A higher HDI means better life because people live longer, learn more, and have more money. It was made by two friends, Amartya Sen from India and Mahbub ul Haq from Pakistan, and the United Nations Development Programme shares it. It's about whether people can be and do good things in their lives. \nChak 86/6 R, also known as Rasool Abad, is a big village in Sahiwal city, Pakistan. It was created during British rule around 1900 and has grown into an urban area with lots of things. It's famous for its big Wood Market, Lakkar Mandi, and a religious figure named Baba Mast. Dr. Fazal Din Sehgal used to be important there. In the 1930s, the village was given to Maher Khar din, who helped families live and work there. It was divided into four parts and became more agricultural. His son, Mehar Amir U Din, continued to develop it. Now, there are different parts like 86 Main Village, Shad-Man Town, and others. In 2002, the village became a union council under General Pervez Musharraf, and Mehar Riaz Ul Haq became the first Nazim, serving three times in Pakistan's history."}], "output": "\nIbn Arabi was born first.**"},

This goddess is mentioned in a poem from the Poetic Edda, made in the 1300s based on older stories. The Prose Edda, also written in the 1300s by Snorri Sturluson, and skaldic poetry also mention her. Some people think Hlín might be another way to call Frigg. \nNorse mythology is a collection of stories and beliefs from the people who lived in Northern Germany and parts of Scandinavia. It started before Christianity became popular and continued into the time when people started believing in God. These stories are about gods, magical creatures, and heroes, and we can learn about them from old writings, pictures from the past, and the stories people used to tell.\nThe Frigg gas field is in the North Sea, close to the UK-Norway border. It's named after a goddess, Frigg. It started producing gas in 1978 and stopped in 2004. It's 230 kilometers from Stavanger. The field's boss was a French company called Elf Aquitaine, which later joined Total S.A. \nEir is a goddess or helper in Norse mythology, known for her medical skills. She appears in three main sources: the Poetic Edda from the 13th century, the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson also from the 13th century, and skaldic poetry from around 1300. Some experts think these might be the same person, and they debate if Eir started as a goddess for healing or a valkyrie (choosing warriors for the afterlife). She has also been connected to Frigg and compared to the Greek goddess Hygieia. \nIn Norse mythology, Sága, a goddess, is known for her wisdom connected to Sökkvabekkr, which might mean a special place with a river or treasure. She and Odin have fun at this place where the water is cool. We learn about them in two big books, the Poetic Edda from the 1300s and the Prose Edda written by Snorri Sturluson in the same time. Some people think Sága might be the same as Frigg, who lived in a place called Fensalir, a fen. \nNanna Nepsdóttir, also known as Nanna, is a goddess in Norse mythology linked to Baldr. Her role is not always clear, as stories differ. In one version from the 13th-century Prose Edda written by Snorri Sturluson, Nanna is Baldr's wife and they had a son named Forseti. When Baldr died, Nanna died of sadness and was placed on his ship with his body, which then caught fire and was sent to sea. In the underworld, they are reunited. To bring Baldr back, Hermóðr visited Hel, where Nanna gave him gifts for Frigg, Fulla, and other gods. Nanna is often mentioned in poems by skalds, and there's a reference to a Nanna in the Poetic Edda, although it's unclear if this is the same figure. \nGná is a Norse goddess who helps Frigg by running tasks in other worlds. She travels on a special horse called Hófvarpnir, which can walk on water. This information is found in a book called the Prose Edda, written in the 1300s. Some people think Gná might be similar to a Roman goddess named Fama. Hófvarpnir and Sleipnir, a magical horse with eight legs, are also important in Norse mythology. \nFensalir, in Norse mythology, is a place where Frigg, the goddess, lives. We know about it from two big books, the Poetic Edda from the 1300s and the Prose Edda also from the 1300s, written by Snorri Sturluson. Some people think Fensalir might be connected to special religious activities in Norse beliefs that were about water, like springs, bogs, or swamps. It could also be related to Sága, a goddess who lived near water, at a place called Sökkvabekkr."}], "output": "\nThe goddess associated with Frigg, Hlín, is not specifically mentioned to consist of tales. Instead, the tales surrounding Frigg herself are extensive in Norse mythology. These tales include her role as the goddess of marriage, mother of Odin and Thor, and her connection to other gods and goddesses. The passage provides information about various goddesses and their roles, but Hlín's tales are not described separately.**"},

They can use trace fossils and study dinosaur bones to understand some actions, like how they moved and lived together. Some dinosaurs gathered in groups for safety, migration, or protecting their young. Some groups, like crocodiles and birds, which are dinosaurs' close relatives, also showed group behavior. Young dinosaurs were often with their parents, and some had special features that might have been for showing off or mating, but we don't know much about these things.\n\nMost dinosaurs moved on land, and understanding their movement is important for understanding their behavior. Scientists have studied the strength of their muscles and bones to learn how fast they could run and if some dinosaurs could make loud noises like a whip. These studies help us imagine how dinosaurs behaved in their world. \nSanjay's Super Team is a simple movie made by Pixar Animation Studios.

Sadly, she died in 1749 just before the book was published. Even though she passed away, her translation, published in 1759, is still the most trusted French version today. She also added a very important idea called the conservation of total energy, which includes energy from movement.\nKatherine Kath, born as Lily Faess on August 11, 1920, was a famous French dancer who performed at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris. She stopped dancing due to a serious injury that ended her career. Later, she became an actress. She was born in Berck, Pas-de-Calais, France, and passed away there in 2012 at the age of 92, but the reason for her death was not mentioned. \nThe Ethiopian Legal Information Website is a website that has laws from Ethiopia on it. It's like a big online library for people, like students, lawyers, and others who need laws to read. It's made by the Law Faculty at Mekelle University in Ethiopia, and they worked with a university in Belgium called Ghent University to create it. Right now, it has laws from the federal government, but they want to add laws from other places too. \nHere's a simpler explanation: \n\nThe main ideas that help things connect are: being close together, repeating, paying attention, feeling happy or sad, and being similar. These ideas were first talked about by two smart people, Aristotle in 300 BC and John Locke in the 1700s. They believed that when we're born, our minds are like a blank piece of paper and we learn everything we know. These ideas are still important for understanding how we learn today. \nJean du Chatelet, sometimes called Baron de Beausoleil and Auffembach, was born in 1578 in Brabant and died around 1645 in Paris, near the Bastille. He was a scientist who studied minerals, worked on mining projects, and had a skill in finding water sources. \nExplanation: The Disney animators Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas wrote a book in 1981 called Twelve Basic Principles of Animation. They created these principles based on the work of Disney animators from the 1930s, who aimed to make their animations more real-like. The principles were not just about making characters look like they follow physics, but also about making them relatable and having the right emotional timing. In simpler terms: The book is about 12 rules for making Disney cartoons that look smooth and feel true to life. \nThe Basic Laws of Israel are like the important rules for the country. They tell how the government works and how people's rights are protected. These rules were started a long time ago and are meant to become the real constitution someday. Right now, Israel uses a mix of written laws, common rules from the past, and decisions made by the Supreme Court to run the country. But, there are still some things not covered by these Basic Laws and the plan to make everything into one big constitution is not finished yet. Judges help decide which rules are more important in some cases."}], "output": "\nEmilie du Chatelet, through her translation and explanation of Isaac Newton's Principia, contributed significantly to the basic laws of physics, particularly by introducing the concept of the conservation of total energy. Her translation, published in 1759, is considered the most trusted French version and her ideas were influential in the understanding of Newton's work during the Enlightenment period.**"},

They were a family group at first, with four siblings, but now it's just Sydney, Noah, and Graham. Their first name used to be Ready Set Go, but they changed it to Echosmith in 2012. They became famous for their song Cool Kids, which did really well, reaching number 13 on a big music list and selling over 1 million copies in the US. It even got double-platinum certifications. The song was a big seller for Warner Bros. in 2014, with 1.3 million downloads. Their first album, Talking Dreams, came out in 2013. \nThe Goo Goo Dolls is a rock band from Buffalo, New York. They started in 1985 with John Rzeznik, Robby Takac, and George Tutuska. In 1995, Mike Malinin became their drummer, but officially joined in 1998. They're known for Iris but also have popular songs like Name, Naked, Slide, and Stay with You. The band has had 19 top 10 hits and sold over 12 million albums all around the world.\nThe Goo Goo Dolls, an American rock band, made a song called All That You Are for a movie released on June 14, 2011. This song and a soundtrack were both available on the Apple iTunes Store on the same day. Two other bands, Linkin Park and Paramore, also released songs for the movie, Iridescent and Monster. This is the second time the Goo Goo Dolls have created music for a Transformers movie, their first was Before It's Too Late for another Transformers movie. \nExplanation: \n\nGoo Goo Dolls' Live in Buffalo is a music album from 2004, released on CD and DVD. It captures their performance at a concert in Buffalo, New York on July 4th, featuring popular songs like Iris, Name, and Slide. The DVD has 19 songs, and there's also a song called Give A Little Bit from their studio on CD. The event took place in downtown Buffalo, near Buffalo City Hall, and the concert was compared to Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense due to its energetic and enigmatic nature.\n\nUnfortunately, the concert faced a rainstorm with over 60,000 people attending, despite the wet conditions. During the performance, the rain briefly interrupted, causing the band to stop for safety. They continued and completed their set, skipping three songs that were originally planned.\n\nIn summary: Live in Buffalo is a Goo Goo Dolls album with a DVD of their July 4, 2004 concert in Buffalo, featuring hits like Iris and Slide. The concert was memorable for its rainy setting, with the band continuing despite the interruptions. \nThe Goo Goo Dolls' first album, made with their name, was made by a band from America. The person who sang in the beginning, Robby Takac, now only plays bass. It's hard to find because it's only on a big record called an LP, not many people have it, and it wasn't widely available. The song I'm Addicted was on a special album from 2001 that had some of their songs. Another song, Torn Apart, was on another album with extra songs, B-sides, and special ones that aren't very common. \nExplanation: The Goo Goo Dolls have a song called Notbroken. This song came out as the second one from their ninth album, Something for the Rest of Us, which was made public on August 31, 2010. The band told people on their website that Notbroken would be the second single from the new album. \n\nRewritten: Notbroken is a song by Goo Goo Dolls.

It came out in two parts, first in Australia on August 28, 2010, and later in North America on August 31, 2010. The album was made during spring to fall 2009 in three studios: GCR Audio in Buffalo, Paramount Studios, and the Ark in Los Angeles. The producer, Tim Palmer, worked with the band.\n\nThe band initially planned to release a song in November 2009 and the whole album in February 2010, but they went back to the studios in January 2010 to improve the album. They had help from different producers, including Butch Vig, John Fields, Paul David Hager, and Rob Cavallo, who had worked on previous albums.\n\nThis album is the third one Cavallo has produced for Goo Goo Dolls. The band member John Rzeznik explained that they took time to write and make sure the songs were the best they could be, and they also needed personal time with his girlfriend.\n\nRobby from the band confirmed that the album would have 12 songs, but Real was not included. The first single, Home, was released on June 8, 2010. \nExplanation: The Goo Goo Dolls released an EP called Waiting for the Rest of It in 2010 for a company called Warner Bros. Records. People who went to their concerts, starting from July 17, got this EP for free as a gift. They gave out this EP to help people know about their new album called Something for the Rest of Us. \n\nRevised Paragraph: In 2010, the Goo Goo Dolls shared an EP called Waiting for the Rest of It with fans who attended their tours starting from July 17.

He worked as a state representative and was the mayor of Detroit from 2002 to 2008. But in 2008, he had to step down from his job because he got in trouble for lying and stopping the truth. He went to jail for a short time, but after serving 99 days, he was allowed to leave on a special promise to follow rules. \nIn 2009, there were elections to become the mayor of Detroit. These happened on May 5, 2009, but first, there was a special election on February 24, 2009, to choose someone because Kwame Kilpatrick, who was already the mayor, had quit.\nJane Marum Roush, born in 1956, is a lawyer from Virginia who served as a temporary Supreme Court judge. In 2015, Governor Terry McAuliffe chose her to replace Justice LeRoy F. Millette, who retired. Her term was set to end 30 days after the next legislative session, unless she was chosen for a longer term. In July 2015, the General Assembly tried to elect her but failed before officially ending. This caused confusion because the Constitution's rules say a special session can't last more than 3 days without the other chamber's approval. The Governor thinks they didn't meet that requirement, but others disagree. As a result, it's uncertain if the first interim term ended, and if so, if the Governor could appoint her again. The situation is still being debated, and if he did, her second interim term would have ended in February 2016. Calgary, Alberta, Canada, has had different election rules for its mayor and council. Until 1923, mayors were elected for one year at a time. Starting in 1971, both positions were for three-year terms. Before that, councillors were elected annually, but from 1914, terms were two years, with half of the council changing each year. In 1976, there were 14 wards, and each ward had a three-year term. In 2010, the title councillor was changed, and in 2012, the term length for both positions was extended to four years.\n\nThis makes the information easier to understand by breaking it down into simpler steps and timelines. \nJoseph F. Vitale is a politician from the United States, a member of the Democratic Party. He has been in the New Jersey State Senate since 1998, working for the 19th Legislative District. Before that, he was the Mayor of Woodbridge Township, a position he got in 2006 when the previous mayor, Frank Pelzman, passed away. Vitale joined the Senate in 1998, replacing Jim McGreevey, who was running for governor at the time. \nIn Illinois, there were two elections for a Senate seat in 2010, happening on November 2. One was for a normal, ongoing position (Class 3) starting in January 2011 for the 112nd Congress. The other was for a short-term replacement since Roland Burris was temporarily in the seat due to Barack Obama becoming president. \nThe local elections in the United Kingdom in 2013 happened on May 2, 2013. They were for councils in 35 places: 27 in big towns and countryside, and 8 with a special type of government. Also, there was an election for a mayor in two places, Doncaster and North Tyneside. The last time these types of elections were held was on June 4, 2009, except for three areas that had them in 2008 instead. \nBrian DelGrosso, born around 1973, used to be a state representative in Colorado.

It's part of a system called renin-angiotensin, and doctors often use medicines to target this system for high blood pressure. Angiotensin also makes the adrenal gland release a hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone helps the body keep more sodium in the kidneys, which in turn makes blood pressure go up. \nAldosterone is a hormone made by the adrenal gland's zona glomerulosa. It helps keep the body's sodium levels in balance by controlling how much is taken in and removed through the kidneys, salivary glands, sweat glands, and colon. It affects blood pressure by talking to special receptors in the kidneys. When aldosterone isn't working right, it can cause health problems like high blood pressure and heart or kidney issues. It's the opposite of a hormone the heart makes to help reduce sodium and blood pressure.\nThe Sodium-Chloride Symporter is a special helper in our kidneys that takes in sodium and chloride from the water in our tubes and sends it back into the cells. It's part of a bigger group called SLC12 cotransporters. In people, the gene for this helper is found on chromosome 16, labeled as SLC12A3. \nThe loop of Henle, found in the kidney, is a part of a nephron that moves from the top to the bottom part. It's called this because a scientist named Friedrich Henle found it. This loop helps to make the kidney's inside, called the medulla, have different levels of concentration. \nLow pressure receptors, also known as volume receptors, are sensors found in the veins returning blood to the heart (venae cavae), lungs' arteries, and heart's atria. They detect changes in the wall tension, which is related to how full the lower parts of the circulation are (below 60mmHg). These receptors help control the release of hormones like antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin, and aldosterone.\n\nWhen the atrial pressure rises, the receptors send signals that reduce the production of ADH and aldosterone. This leads to more urine being produced, which in turn lowers blood pressure. On the other hand, when the atria stretch, they stimulate the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which increases the amount of water and sodium being flushed out through the urine, further helping to lower blood pressure. \nRenal tubular acidosis (RTA) is when the body has too much acid because the kidneys can't properly make the urine acidic enough. The kidneys filter blood and remove extra things like salts and acids when it goes through tiny tubes called nephrons. If the kidneys don't keep enough bicarbonate (a base) or make enough hydrogen ions (an acid) in the tubes, it can cause acid buildup. RTA is different from just not having enough kidney function, and there are different types with their own special problems. \nExplanation: The nephron in your kidney has a part called the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This comes after a bend in the loop, which is after the descending limb. This part of the kidney tubule, which gets bigger, is called both the thick ascending limb and the distal straight tubule, different from the distal convoluted tubule further down. \n\n Simplified: The kidney part that follows the bend in the loop is called the ascending limb. It's a bit thicker and is also called the distal straight tubule, not to be confused with the distal convoluted tubule further along. \nExplanation: The kidney has a system called tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) to control how much water and stuff is filtered out of our blood (glomerular filtration rate, or GFR). Inside each kidney part called a nephron, the tubules, which are further along in the flow, tell the glomerulus, which is at the beginning, what's happening.

These elections happen halfway through a president named Donald Trump's time in charge. There will be elections for 435 seats in a big house and 33 seats in a bigger house called the Senate. Also, in 39 states, they'll choose new leaders for their governments and there will be many other smaller elections for state and city jobs. \nNancy Soderberg, born in 1958, is an American expert in foreign policy. She worked closely with President Bill Clinton, serving as Deputy National Security Advisor and UN Ambassador. Currently, she leads Soderberg Global Solutions and teaches at the University of North Florida. In 2011-2014, President Obama appointed her as the Chair of the Public Interest Declassification Board. She has held various roles in politics and international organizations, including being a Kennedy advisor and campaign helper. She's also a frequent commentator on TV and radio. She has written books on foreign policy and earned a Master's degree in development economics from Georgetown and a Bachelor's from Vanderbilt. In 2017, she announced her intention to run for Congress in Florida's 6th District as a Democrat.\nIn 2016, Wisconsin had big elections to choose people for important jobs. They happened on November 8th, and people were voting for two seats in the Senate and eight in the House of Representatives. Also, half of the Senate seats and all Assembly seats were up for grabs. Before the main election, there was a special event called the primary elections, which happened on August 9th. \nMidterm elections in the US are like special elections that happen two years after the big ones for the President. These elections are for people who work in the government, like the people in the House of Representatives (435 seats) and some of the Senators (100 seats, 33 or 34 at a time). These elections happen around the middle of a four-year President's term. \nIn the United States, there are three types of Senators, each with 33 or 34 seats. The main goal is to decide which seats need to be chosen every two years, instead of all 100 at once. This is done by dividing them into three groups - Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3. In 2012, Class 1 seats were elected, in 2014, Class 2 seats, and in 2016, Class 3 seats were up for grabs. \nTeam Unity was a political group that worked together for the 2007 elections in the Philippines. It had members who were once against the previous president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, and her allies. Their goal was to help her by getting more Senate seats and stop any plans to impeach her, since she was part of the administration. \nThe 80th United States Congress was a group of lawmakers from the US government, made up of the Senate and House of Representatives. They met in Washington D.C. from 1947 to 1949, during President Harry Truman's third and fourth years in office. This Congress had its members based on the 1940 US Census. The Republicans, who won more seats, became the majority in both chambers.\n\nEven though the Congress passed 906 laws, President Truman called it the Do Nothing Congress because he didn't agree with their actions. During the election in 1948, Truman criticized them. Some important business laws, like the Taft-Hartley Act, were passed, but the Congress didn't support most of Truman's plans to help people, called the Fair Deal. As a result, the Democrats won back more seats in the next Congress. \nThe US elections in 2002 happened on November 5 during President George W. Bush's first term. Something rare happened - even though it's usually the other way around, the president's party, the Republicans, did better than expected. They got more seats in both the Senate and the House, with 2 extra Senate seats and 8 in the House."}], "output": "\nDuring the midterm elections in 2018, Nancy Soderberg is running for Congress in Florida's 6th District as a Democrat, so the number of Senate seats contested in her specific election would be 1 (since she's running for a seat in the Senate). However, the passage doesn't provide the exact number of Senate seats that will be contested in a general midterm election. The total number of Senate seats up for grabs in any given midterm election is 34 (100 seats, with 33 contested at a time due to the division into Classes 1, 2, and 3). If you need that information for a general election, it would be 34.**"},

Thompkins and Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan which one was a  case decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court of the United States? \n\n Passage: \nMississippi University for Women vs. Hogan was a court case in 1982 where the Supreme Court of the United States, with a 5-4 decision, said that the school's policy of only admitting women was not fair because it didn't follow the rule of equal protection in the Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe Berghuis v. Thompkins decision by the Supreme Court in 2010 (case number 08-1470) is about a person who knows they have the right to stay quiet during questioning, as told by the Miranda rule, but doesn't say they want to use that right. The Court looked at what happens in situations like this.\nThe Hoffman v. Jones case, decided by the Supreme Court of Florida in 1973, was the first time a court in the US applied the idea of comparative negligence in accidents, not just by law but through a judicial decision. It was a very important case because it changed the rule that if someone was hurt in an accident, they couldn't get compensation if they also contributed to the problem, a rule called contributory negligence which was very old, almost 150 years. Instead, the court said people could still get some compensation for the part of the harm caused by the person who was at fault, even if they were partly to blame. This new concept, pure comparative negligence, has been widely used in legal decisions since then. \nVan Staphorst vs. Maryland, a court case from 1791 in the United States Supreme Court, was the very first one to be officially recorded. Even though the court planned to hear and decide it, the dispute was resolved before the lawyers could speak. Collet vs. Collet was the first case the court heard at the appellate level. West v. Barnes was the first case the court actually ruled on. \nThe Whole Woman's Health case, decided by the US Supreme Court on June 27, 2016, said that Texas cannot put too many rules on abortion clinics, making it hard for women to get one. On June 28, the court didn't listen to challenges from Wisconsin and Mississippi, where similar rules were not allowed. This might affect other states with similar rules too. \nIn the Hirabayashi v. United States case in 1943, the US Supreme Court said that curfews for minority groups, like Japanese Americans during World War II, were okay because the country was fighting a war with their home country. This happened after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the US joined the war. The government, under President Franklin Roosevelt, allowed leaders to keep certain areas safe, and Japanese Americans were affected by this, including a curfew. A man named Gordon Hirabayashi got in trouble for breaking the curfew and took it to the Supreme Court. Another case, Yasui v. United States, was decided the same day and both cases were later corrected in the 1980s. \nIn a case called Commissioner v. Banks in 2005, the Supreme Court in the US decided if money a person gets from a court or settlement, which they paid to their lawyer as a part of a special fee agreement, should be taxed as income. The court said yes, this money is income. But, for situations where someone gets money because of a job discrimination case, there's a change. The Civil Rights Tax Relief law from 2004 lets people subtract the lawyer's fees from their income taxes. \nIn the case of Summers v. Earth Island Institute in 2009, the Supreme Court, with a 5-4 vote, decided that some groups fighting for the environment could sue the US Forest Service. They were trying to stop the Forest Service from selling 238 acres of burned land for timber without following the normal steps required by a law called the Forest Service Decision-making and Appeals Reform Act, which usually includes giving people a chance to give their opinions."}], "output": "\nMississippi University for Women v.

In simpler terms, this album includes songs she loves because of the artists she looks up to.\nRick Astley's second album, Hold Me in Your Arms, was released in November 1988. It came after his first album, Whenever You Need Somebody. The album was made by a mix of people: half was created by Stock Aitken & Waterman, who are known for pop music, and the other half was made by other musicians at PWL Studios. Unfortunately, a fire at PWL Studios caused a delay in the album's release because some of Astley's songs were lost. This was the last album Astley made with Stock, Aitken & Waterman because he wanted to change his style, leave behind the dance-pop sound, and focus on writing his own songs. He later released a soul album, Free, in 1991. Boy Next Door is Jamelia's fifth song, from her first album Drama. It didn't reach the top 40 in the UK, only reaching #42 and staying for two weeks in the Top 75.

It was his first album that came out under a label called Arista Records. \nThe boy next door is a common character in stories, representing a simple and good-hearted guy. In Western stories, he is often the typical guy your neighbor might be. He can be the love interest for a girl who lives close by. \nStacey Kent, an American jazz singer, recorded a version of it for her album The Boy Next Door in 2003. This song has been performed by other musicians too, including Stan Getz, Bruce Eskovitz, Carmen McRae, Lee Konitz, Spike Robinson, Eddie Higgins, and Bennie Wallace. \nSuperstar - The Hits is a collection of Jamelia's popular songs, a British R&B singer's best work. It came out on September 24, 2007, from Parlophone Records. This album has ten of her songs that were very popular in the UK, but it doesn't include her first song, So High, I Do, Boy Next Door, and Universal Prayer (which still hasn't been released here). But don't worry, it does have her version of Stop that you can find on this album for the first time."}], "output": "\nJazz singer.** \n\nThe passage states that \"Stacey Kent, an American jazz singer, recorded a version of 'The Boy Next Door' for her album The Boy Next Door in 2003.\""},

That year, new people took charge - George Kokinis was the general manager and Eric Mangini was the head coach, but Kokinis was fired halfway through the season during a break in November. The team played all their games at home at Cleveland Browns Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. \nThe AFC North is a group in the NFL's American Football Conference. It used to be called the AFC Central in 1970.

Unfortunately, it crashed on March 5, 1966, due to strong air turbulence near Mount Fuji in Japan. The plane involved was a Boeing 707-436, flown by Captain Bernard Dobson, a 45-year-old pilot from Dorset who had been flying 707s since November 1960. \nThe Boeing 707 is a big airplane that can fly far, has four engines, and can carry 140 to 219 people. It was made by Boeing from 1958 to 1979. People often say its name as seven oh seven. It can go as far as 2,500 miles.\nBOAC Flight 712, also known as Speedbird 712, was a flight by British Overseas Airways (BOAC) using a Boeing 707-465.

It can hold 382 people and has 295 workers on board. It has a sister ship called Silver Whisper. Both were built in Italy by Mariotti Shipyard. These ships are unique because they have a lot of space per person, about 74 spaces for each passenger, which is more than any other cruise ship. The space ratio shows this by dividing the ship's size by the number of people it can carry. The passenger-to-crew ratio is good too, with 1.31 people for each passenger. \nSilver Whisper is a cruise ship that started working in 2000 and is run by Silversea Cruises. It can hold 382 people to travel, and there are 295 workers on board. It has a sister ship named Silver Shadow. Both were built in Italy, by a shipyard called Mariotti Shipyard.

There is also a low number of passengers per worker, with 1.31 passengers for every crew member. \nBall-bearing Run was a special flight during a war called Stockholm to Leuchers. It was done by the Royal Norwegian Air Force, but they pretended to be BOAC (an airline) because of some politics. The planes had regular names, the people on them were from the Norwegian military, but they used British passports and wore BOAC uniforms. \nOn June 1, 1943, BOAC Flight 777-A, a plane from Lisbon, Portugal, to Bristol, England, was flying. Unfortunately, it was attacked by eight German planes and ended up crashing into the Bay of Biscay, causing everyone on board, including actor Leslie Howard, to die. \nThe Freedom class is a collection of three cruise ships owned by Royal Caribbean International. The first one, Freedom of the Seas, was the biggest cruise ship at that time in 2006. It was the largest in terms of passengers and size. However, this title was later taken by the Oasis of the Seas, which was built in November 2009. Before that, all three ships in this class held the record together."}], "output": "\nThe largest passenger capacity of the plane type used for BOAC Flight 911, which was a Boeing 707-436, was 140 to 219 people.**"},

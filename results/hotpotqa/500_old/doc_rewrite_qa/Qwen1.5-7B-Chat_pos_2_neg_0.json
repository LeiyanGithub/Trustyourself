The reference to a Prime Minister is not directly tied to the city itself, but rather to the naming of the school. However, since the school is located in Marion and was established by the government, it can be inferred that the Prime Minister in question, likely related to the naming decision, is likely referring to a past Australian Prime Minister who might have been involved in educational policies or had a connection to the school's naming. Without a specific mention of the Prime Minister's name, it's not possible to pinpoint the exact individual, but the connection is through the school's naming."},

It's part of a system called renin-angiotensin, and doctors often use medicines to target this system for high blood pressure. Angiotensin also makes the adrenal gland release a hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone helps the body keep more sodium in the kidneys, which in turn makes blood pressure go up. \nAldosterone is a hormone made by the adrenal gland's zona glomerulosa. It helps keep the body's sodium levels in balance by controlling how much is taken in and removed through the kidneys, salivary glands, sweat glands, and colon. It affects blood pressure by talking to special receptors in the kidneys. When aldosterone isn't working right, it can cause health problems like high blood pressure and heart or kidney issues.

It opened in 1958 and is known for hosting a famous boxing match in 1965. There, Muhammad Ali took a picture with Sonny Liston that became one of the most iconic sports photos of all time. \nThe Lewiston Maineiacs were a junior ice hockey team from Lewiston, Maine, playing in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League. They played at the Androscoggin Bank Colisée. They were the second team from the US in the league and the only one to complete a full season. In 2007, they won the President's Cup.\nThe Billings Bulls were a junior ice hockey team in Billings, Montana. They used to play at Centennial Ice Arena, a small venue that could hold 550 people. Because of its size, their games were often sold out. Before that, they played at Metrapark, which could hold up to 9,000 people for hockey. But they had to move because they couldn't agree with arena managers and local leaders on the lease terms. \nThe Robins Center is a big sports arena in Richmond, Virginia, with 7,201 seats. It opened in 1972 and is where the University of Richmond Spiders play basketball. Before this arena, the team played in different places around Richmond. The arena is named after E.

This can include lowering interest rates or monthly payments, or reducing the amount owed. Banks do this to help borrowers avoid losing their homes (foreclosure). This practice became more common after the 2008 housing market crash in the US, especially from banks like Washington Mutual, Chase, and JP Morgan. The government, IRS, and President Obama's letters helped borrowers get help to keep their homes. This led to the creation of loan modification programs like HAMP and HARP. Before these modifications, people would use different methods like loan assumptions and transfers to deal with financial problems. During the Great Depression, the government tried to stop foreclosures by setting rules and investigating illegal actions by lenders. The 2008 crash brought loan modifications as a national policy to prevent further problems. The main issue was that some lenders took advantage of homeowners by hiding the true cost of their mortgages, especially with balloon mortgages. Modifications helped fix these issues by making mortgage terms fairer and stopping illegal practices. Many people involved in real estate were punished for their actions. In 2009, programs like HARP, HAMP, and modifications were introduced to protect homeowners. These actions helped stop the unfair practices and made things right for consumers. \nThe Case Gym is a big sports place with 1,800 seats at Boston University in Boston.

Banks can lower the interest rate, monthly payments, or the amount owed to make it easier for the borrower.

The government, like the Department of Housing and the IRS, stepped in to help people keep their homes by offering loan modifications. These modifications were created to fix problems caused by bad lending practices and to stop more people from losing their homes. Before loan modifications, people would try other methods like loan transfers or assumptions to deal with financial difficulties. During the Great Depression, similar actions were taken to stop foreclosures. During the 2008 housing crash, loan modifications became a big part of the government's plan to save the economy. The crash happened because some lenders were being dishonest and taking advantage of people's ignorance about their mortgages. The modifications were a way to fix the mistakes and protect homeowners from further harm. The government created agencies like the FBI and the IRS to make sure everyone followed the rules and to stop people from committing fraud. Modifications were introduced to help people who were victims of these bad practices and to make sure the housing market worked fairly again. \nSouth Phoenix is a part of Phoenix, Arizona.

It was first made for the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and works with some later Macs too. The first three versions of Apple TV used this remote, but it was replaced by the Siri Remote in the fourth generation. Before the Apple Remote, Apple made simple IR remotes for things like the Macintosh TV and PowerCD drive. \nFront Row is a program that used to let Mac computers and Apple TV watch and play videos, pictures, music, and podcasts.

Basic universal remotes can only control a certain number of devices based on the manufacturer's limit, but more advanced ones let you add new devices by programming them. Often, when you buy a remote for one device, it might also work with other gadgets. For example, you can use a VCR remote to control various TV brands. \nA remote control is a small device that lets you control electronic things, like a TV or DVD player, from far away.

It lets you control and manage other devices from a Windows or Windows Mobile device. The software first came out in 1989 for DOS networks. It's great because it lets you see thumbnails of many remote systems and switch between them easily, like a keyboard and mouse for multiple computers. You can also transfer files, chat, and check hardware and software on the remote devices. It has less functionality for Linux and Mac users. In 2012, they added support for iOS and Android tablets and phones, as well as a version for Macs. They released a new version in 2013 that added support for ChromeOS too. Both the controlling device and the device being controlled need to have NetSupport Manager installed before you can use it. \nApple Watch is a smartwatch made by Apple.

MTH's DCS controller can also control TMCC trains, and all systems can be on the same track without needing separate voltages.\n\nTMCC and Legacy send signals to the train's antenna, identifying the locomotive by number and controlling features like speed, sounds, and lighting. DCS does this by transmitting a carrier through the rails. TMCC/Legacy remotes send commands through a separate device, while LionChief/LionChief+ locos have built-in remotes that work directly with the train.\n\nIn 2017, Lionel introduced a universal remote for LionChief+ that can control up to three trains at once, making it easier to manage multiple trains. \nApple Remote Desktop is a program created by Apple that helps people in charge of many computers or teachers who need to help others or show things to groups.

In reality, it was Chief Iron Hail who suffered that loss. \nKyo is a Japanese musician, poet, and singer-songwriter who is famous for being the lead singer of a metal band called Dir en grey.

They believed in different forms of socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution, they worked with other groups to form the Russian Provisional Government. In November 1917, they got the most votes in the first democratic election but things changed with the October Revolution. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, stopped the Constituent Assembly and caused a split within the SRs. The pro-Bolshevik faction, called the Right SRs, supported Kerensky but lost in the Civil War and faced persecution from the Bolsheviks. \nThe Russian Civil War happened right after the Russian Revolutions in 1917. Many groups fought to decide Russia's future. The main groups were the Red Army, led by Vladimir Lenin for socialism, and the White Army, which had different beliefs like monarchy, capitalism, and other forms of socialism. Some other groups also fought. Foreign countries like the Allies and pro-German armies helped the White Army. The Red Army won most of the battles by 1919, and the White forces were defeated in Crimea by 1920. Fighting continued in some areas until 1923, but Red control of the Soviet Union was solid by then. The war caused a huge number of deaths, mostly among civilians, and is considered one of the worst disasters in Europe's history.\nRussia's communism started when Tsar Nicholas II lost control during the February Revolution. A new government called the Provisional Government took over with Prince Lvov leading, but the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, disagreed and started a revolution in October 1917. They won control and Lenin ruled from 1917 to 1924. The Bolsheviks created the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which caused a big fight, called the Russian Civil War, between the Reds (Bolsheviks) and Whites. In 1922, the Reds won and formed the Soviet Union. Lenin passed away in 1924, leading to a power struggle that ended with Joseph Stalin becoming the boss. He stayed in charge until 1953 and was known for causing fear and carrying out a big event called the Great Purge to get rid of people who opposed him. \nLavr Kornilov was a military man in Russia during World War I and the Civil War. He is famous for trying to help the Provisional Government in 1917 but his actions led to him being arrested for trying to overthrow the government. This actually made the Bolshevik party and the soviets stronger. \nAfter the October Revolution, there were fights and protests by other left-wing groups against the Bolsheviks. These groups, like the Socialist Revolutionaries, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists, didn't agree with the Bolsheviks and kept fighting even during and after the Civil War, from 1918 to around 1924. The Bolsheviks tried to include these groups at first, but eventually used force to stop them. \nLouise Bryant was a journalist, activist, and feminist who is famous for her support of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. She married writer John Reed and wrote about important Russian figures like Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. Her articles, which were published in newspapers in the US and Canada after World War I, were based on her visits to Petrograd and Moscow. She even wrote a book called Six Red Months in Russia in 1918. She spoke out in favor of the revolution and against US intervention in Russia by giving testimony to the Overman Committee and going on a speaking tour in 1919. \nIn June 1919, during the Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks led by Yakov Triapitsyn surprised an American camp in Romanovka, Siberia close to Vladivostok. The Americans successfully defended against the attack, marking the last significant battle involving the US in that conflict. After Romanovka, there were smaller fights between Americans, Bolsheviks, and Cossacks, with the Americans always winning. \nKerensky-Krasnov uprising was when Alexander Kerensky tried to take control again after the Bolsheviks took over his temporary government in Petrograd. \nTimofey Samsonov was a Soviet politician and a war hero. He was a member of the top leadership of the Communist Party during three different Congresses. He held important positions like Chief Administrator and head of the Accounting Department. Sadly, he passed away in Moscow. \nAlexander Kerensky was a Russian lawyer who played a significant role in the 1917 Revolution. He initially joined the Provisional Government after the February Revolution, holding positions like Minister of Justice and Minister of War. As a member of the moderate Trudovik faction, he also served as the vice-chairman of the Petrograd Soviet. However, his government was replaced by the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin, during the October Revolution. After that, Kerensky lived in exile in Paris and New York City, working for the Hoover Institution until his death in 1970."}], "output": "\n1923.**"},

It has two kinds: Rough Collie with long hair and Smooth Collie with short hair. People think this breed started from old herding dogs from a long time ago, like Roman Cattle Dogs, Celtic Dogs, and Viking dogs. Other dogs that might be related are the Gordon and Irish Setters.\nThe Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting dog that comes from a mix of different breeds. It's similar to the American Rat Terrier but has more muscle, heavier bones, and shorter legs. This breed has a history connected to the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terrier. Early on, people brought over terriers and other working dogs from England, and they were bred mostly for their useful skills like hunting and farm work. The breed's ancestors include the Feist, Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, English White Terrier (now extinct), Turnspit dog, and Wry Legged Terrier. To make them better hunters, they were sometimes bred with Beagles or Beagle mixes. This mix of breeds gives the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier a sharp sense of smell, intelligence, and a strong desire to be close to their owners. They can be a bit distant with people they don't know, but they are very loyal and loving companions. \nA Feist is a small hunting dog that was brought to the United States by English miners and other working class people. The dog's ancestors were probably a mix of Smooth Fox Terriers, Manchester Terriers, and a type of dog that's no longer around, the English White Terrier. These dogs were great at catching rats and people enjoyed watching them. Later, some Feists were crossed with faster dogs like Whippets and Italian Greyhounds, and with better hunters like Beagles. This made the Feist family more diverse and useful for different tasks, not just rat catching. \nThe English Setter is a medium-sized dog breed that belongs to the Setter family. This family also includes red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. These dogs have a beautiful, mainly white coat that is medium-length. They have long, silky hair on their legs, belly, and tail, and their coat might have small colored patches, which are called belton. \nThe Russian Toy is a tiny dog breed from Russia, originally made from the English Toy Terrier, which is now called the Manchester Terrier. There are two types of fur: smooth and long. Before 1988, they were called differently, but now they share the name Russian Toy Terrier. In 2006, this breed became recognized by the International Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club, starting to compete in events in 2010. The first rules for the two types of fur were written in Russia in 1966. \nThe viol, viola da gamba, or gamba, is a type of stringed instrument with a wooden body and pegs to adjust the pitch. It has frets made of gut to help with playing and was popular during the Renaissance and Baroque times (1600-1750). It evolved from earlier instruments like the rebab, vielle, and Spanish vihuela, which was similar to a lute and different from the early guitar. \nThe collie is a special kind of dog that helps with herding. It comes from places like Scotland and Northern England. These dogs are medium-sized, have a pointy nose, and often have white spots on their shoulders. They are very active, good at herding, and can be found in different parts of the world, like Australia and North America. Collies can work with farm animals, be pets, or participate in dog sports where they show their amazing agility, strength, and how easy they are to train. There are different types of collies, some meant for shows and others for actual herding tasks, and they are known for their smartness too. \nThe Toy Manchester Terrier is a small dog breed that belongs to the terrier category. In North America, people made this breed smaller from the original Manchester Terrier. In the United States (American Kennel Club) and Canada (Canadian Kennel Club), they put it in the Toy Group. However, two other big dog organizations, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and The Kennel Club, do not have a separate Toy version of the Manchester Terrier. \nFlorence Nagle was a multi-talented woman who trained, bred, and was passionate about racehorses and pedigreed dogs. She achieved great success in the world of Irish Wolfhounds, becoming the owner or breeder of twenty-one United Kingdom Champions.

Additionally, Nagle excelled in field trials with Irish Setters, earning eighteen Field Trial Champions titles between the 1920s and mid-1960s.

It was a significant victory for Ethiopia as it led to Italy's defeat and solidified Ethiopia's independence. \nGiuseppe Edoardo Arimondi was an Italian general who is famous for his victory against the Mahdists in the First Italo-Ethiopian War. Before the famous Kitchener's Expedition, he won a big battle at Agordat in 1893. Arimondi had a successful career in colonial service and unfortunately died in a battle at Adwa. He was honored with the Gold Medal of Military Valor after his death.\nThe First Italo-Ethiopian War happened between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896. Italy wanted to control Ethiopia because of a disagreement about a treaty. Germany and Austria, Italy's friends, joined in. Surprisingly, Ethiopia's leader, Menelik II, had support from some of his old enemies. Italy's army, which invaded from Eritrea, faced a stronger Ethiopia than they thought because of this support and help from Russia, a country with similar beliefs. The UK and France also helped Ethiopia to stop Italy from becoming a rival colonizer.\n\nThe fighting started in 1895, and Italy did well at first, but Ethiopia fought back and surrounded an Italian fort called Meqele. The fort surrendered. The turning point was the Battle of Adwa, where Ethiopia's army won a big victory and made the Italians retreat back to Eritrea. \nEthiopia and Japan have a relationship with each other. They are countries that have a long history and managed to stop European attempts to control them. Ethiopia won at the Battle of Adwa and Japan won at the Battle of Tsushima. Before World War II, they thought of each other as possible friends because they respected each other's strength. \nEthiopia is an ancient landlocked country in Africa's Horn region. It has been around for a very long time and is the second most populous nation in Africa. Ethiopia is famous for its role in human history, with some of the earliest human remains found near Addis Ababa. The country's history starts with Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC and has a continuous tradition dating back to the Aksumite Empire (also known as Ethiopia) and even earlier. After a time of local rule in the 18th and 19th centuries, Ethiopia was reunified by Kassa Hailu in 1855, marking the beginning of its modern era. The country expanded its territory and fought off foreign invaders, like Italy in 1896, led by Ras Makonnen. Unfortunately, Ethiopia was occupied by Italy from 1936 to 1941, but it was eventually freed by British and Ethiopian forces. \nSaint Ephigenia, also known as Iphigenia from Ethiopia, is a folk saint. She is said to have lived in the 1st century and converted to Christianity. According to the Golden Legend, she was chosen by St. Matthew, an apostle spreading Christianity in Ethiopia, which is believed to be in the areas around the Caspian Sea, possibly in Mesopotamia or Ancient Armenia. She became a symbol of devotion to God. \nHerbert S. Lewis is a retired anthropology professor from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who taught from 1963 to 1998. He is well-known for his extensive field research, particularly in Ethiopia. In the 1950s and 1960s, he studied the history of the Oromo (Galla) Kingdom of Jimma Abba Jifar and the daily lives of modern Oromos. His research focused on political leadership, community organization, ethnohistory, and culture. He wrote a book, initially titled A Galla Monarchy, examining the monarchy's structure, the ruler's power, and its origins. In his 1965-66 study, he concentrated on the role of spirit mediums, k'allu, in organizing religious activities, resolving conflicts, and providing informal political leadership in rural areas. You can find some of his ethnographic photographs in the University of Wisconsin's Digital Library under the Africa Focus link. \nP'ent'ay is a word used to describe Protestant Christians in Ethiopia and by Ethiopians living outside the country. It was originally meant as a negative term for churches with Pentecostal beliefs but now refers to non-Orthodox Protestant Christians. It's similar to the term Evangelicals in other languages. In Ethiopia, there are several major Evangelical denominations like Kale Heywet, Mekane Yesus, Lutheran, Mulu Wongel, and Meserete Kristos (Mennonite). Some P'ent'ay groups, like Mekane Yesus, have been influenced by the Orthodox Church but generally practice Pentecostal worship and beliefs. \nThe Second Battle of Agordat happened in December 1893 when Italian soldiers and some Sudanese people called Mahdists fought each other. The leader, Emir Ahmed Ali, had about 10,000 to 12,000 men who went east from Kassala. They met 2,400 Italians and their helpers from Eritrea, led by Colonel Arimondi, near a place called Agordat, which is west of Asmara. In a big and tough fight, over 1,000 Dervishes, including the Emir, died. This battle was a significant event. \nThe Treaty of Addis Ababa, signed on October 23, 1896, officially ended the First Italo-Ethiopian War. Ethiopia gained the upper hand, especially because of their victory at the Battle of Adwa in March. This treaty replaced a previous secret agreement. Italy agreed to cancel the Treaty of Wuchale and acknowledged Ethiopia as an independent nation."}], "output": "\nIndependence.**"},

It's by the sea, surrounded by trees, a beach, and grasslands. This area is important for nature and has a special name called the Firth of Forth Site of Special Scientific Interest. To the north, it's next to the big Firth of Forth, while to the south, there's a village named Dirleton and a castle. On the east side, there's a golf course called North Berwick West Links, and on the west side, you'll find the Archerfield Estate and more golf courses. \nDirleton Castle is a very old fortress located in a village called Dirleton in Scotland. It's about 2 miles west of North Berwick and about 19 miles east of Edinburgh. The castle was built a long time ago, in the 1300s, but people stopped living there by the end of the 1600s.\nLothian and Borders is a region in southern Scotland that includes the areas of East Lothian, Edinburgh City, Midlothian, West Lothian (all together called Lothian), as well as the Scottish Borders. \nThe Scottish Borders is a region in Scotland with 32 local councils.

You can find the church at coordinates NT512842, along the A198 road. \nDirleton is a village in East Lothian, Scotland, about 20 miles east of Edinburgh. It's near North Berwick to the east, Gullane to the west, Fenton Barns to the south, and the Yellowcraigs nature reserve, Archerfield Estate, and the Firth of Forth to the north. A long time ago, in 1612, the government joined Gullane to Dirleton because Gullane was not doing well, but Dirleton was growing. \nHaddington is a significant town in East Lothian, Scotland, acting as the main hub for administrative, cultural, and geographical activities in the area. From 1889 to 1921, due to local government changes, it was recognized as Haddingtonshire. Situated about 20 miles east of Edinburgh, the name Haddington has Germanic roots, dating back to the 6th or 7th century when it became part of the Bernicia kingdom. After being ceded by King Edgar of England in the 10th century, it joined Scotland. Haddington gained the status of a burgh early on during King David I's reign (1124-1153), which allowed it to grow into a bustling market town due to trading rights. \nThe Lordship of Parliament called Lord Haliburton of Dirleton, created around 1450, was given to Sir Walter de Haliburton, who was the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland.

It comes in a box with 4 CDs or 5 vinyl records. The first song, To Know Him Is to Love Him, is from 1958 when Spector was part of the Teddy Bears. The box has cool stuff like pictures, song lyrics, details about the music, and an article by Tom Wolfe about Spector. It even has a tiny red pin with the Back to Mono logo. \nTo Know Him Is to Love Him is a song written by Phil Spector, inspired by a phrase on his dad's tombstone. The Teddy Bears, a group he was part of, sang it first and it became very popular, staying at number one on the Billboard chart for three weeks in 1958. Other artists like Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton also sang it, changing the title slightly to To Know You Is to Love You. In 1987, Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris sang it together as a trio, and it became a hit again, especially in the country music charts. The song has a unique time signature called 12/8.\nThe Trash Box is a special collection of music from the 1960s, with lots of garage rock and psychedelic songs from American bands. It's like a bigger version of the Pebbles Box, which had 5 records. The Trash Box has most of the same music as the Pebbles Box, plus extra songs at the end of each CD. It's like having the first five CDs from the Pebbles series, but with some differences in the songs compared to the original records or later CDs.\n\nThe Trash Box has 109 tracks, which is more than the single CDs and the Pebbles Box. Some songs are new to this collection and haven't been on the other Pebbles albums. One surprising choice is the popular song I Fought the Law (but the Law Won) by Bobby Fuller Four, instead of a rarer song Wine Wine Wine from Pebbles, Volume 2. It's a bit confusing, but that's how it is. \nChrome, Smoke & BBQ is a music box set by the American blues-rock band ZZ Top. It came out in 2003 and was special because it had the original versions of songs from the band's first five albums on CD for the very first time. Before this, only one other CD, called Rancho Texicano, had those original mixes. The Best of ZZ Top in 1977 had a few songs from the first two albums, but not the original mixes. In 2006, Tres Hombres and Fandango! got their original mixes too. Then, in 2013, a big CD box set called 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' was released, which had all ten of ZZ Top's studio albums from that time period, including the original mixes. \nThe Live in Japan is a special collection of music by a famous saxophonist named John Coltrane and his band. It comes in a big box with four CDs. The music was first put out as three albums in the 1970s by a company called Impulse! There are different versions with names like Concert In Japan, Coltrane In Japan, and Second Night In Tokyo. Some of these songs were also put together in two more albums later. \n\nThe first time these CDs were made, they came in two sets for Japan. In the US, they put it all in one big 4-CD set, using the same old recordings. But there's a part of one of the albums that has an interview, but it's not on any newer CDs. \nNashville Rebel is a box set by Waylon Jennings, which came out in 2006. It's the first big collection of his music, with 92 songs from 1958 to 1994. The songs are picked from most of his career and cover different stages. The first song is from 1958, and the last one is from 1995. It has many of his popular songs and some special collaborations, like with Willie Nelson and The Highwaymen. There are a few songs that were never heard before, like a duet with Johnny Cash. The box set has four CDs, a booklet with 140 pages, and notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye. \nRadiohead Box Set is a collection of the band's first six studio albums and one live recording. It was released on December 10, 2007, and comes in three formats: seven CDs, digital download, and a 4GB USB drive. The collection reached #95 on Canada's album sales chart. \nMono Masters is a Beatles compilation album that features only mono versions of songs. It's part of a bigger set called The Beatles in Mono. The set focuses on songs with a special mono mix, leaving out songs mixed only in stereo later. Mono Masters has different songs than Past Masters because some newer songs didn't have a mono mix, and it includes mono versions of songs from stereo-only albums. Some tracks were meant for a mono EP in 1969 but never came out. The last Beatles single mixed for mono, Get Back, was released in the UK but not the US. So, Mono Masters doesn't have songs from UK stereo singles. \nThe Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 is a special double album that came out on September 21, 1993. It has all the music from Led Zeppelin, a famous rock band, that wasn't in their earlier box set from 1990. The songs are all remastered, and there's a new song called Baby Come On Home that was never heard before. The set also has a booklet with 54 pages and includes almost every song from their nine albums, two live BBC recordings, one non-album song, and one studio outtake. So, it's like a complete collection of their work! \nThe Doors: Vinyl Box Set is a special collection for the famous band, The Doors. It has 7 records with their first 6 albums, remastered in better sound. The design looks like the old ones from 1967 to 1971. This set was supposed to come out in October 2007, but there were problems with the vinyl and making the box. So, it was released much later in February 2008. They had to fix the problems, like bad test pressings, artwork issues, and find a better type of vinyl to use."}], "output": "\nPhil Spector**"},

He held the position of Second Secretary of the Communist Party from 1965 and was considered the main ideologue until his death in 1982. Suslov focused on maintaining party democracy and ensuring power was divided within the party. However, his strict approach to change made him a key opponent of reforms within the Soviet Union. \nEphraim Sklyansky was a Soviet statesman who became involved with the Bolsheviks while studying medicine at Kiev University. After graduating in 1916, he served as a doctor in the army and played a significant role in secret Bolshevik groups. During the October Revolution, he joined the Military Revolutionary Committee and caught Trotsky's attention with his dedication and creativity. Trotsky appointed him as his deputy on the Revolutionary Military Council, where he made a positive impact during the Russian Civil War (1918-1920). In 1924, his position changed, and he was given different responsibilities, including touring Europe to gather technical information. Unfortunately, Sklyansky died in a boating accident in August 1925 on Long Lake, New York, along with another prominent figure. Some believe he was drowned on Stalin's orders, although this remains a theory. \nAnastas Mikoyan was a very important communist leader in the Soviet Union.

It has around 700 types of plants. People also call them campion or catchfly, but there's another similar group called Lychnis. Most of these Silene plants can be found in many places, especially in the northern part of the world. \nFerocactus is a type of big, round cactus with sharp needles and tiny flowers. There are around 30 different kinds of these plants. You can find them in the southwestern part of the United States and northwestern Mexico.\nThe white campion, Silene latifolia (previously known as Melandrium album), is a flowering plant from the Caryophyllaceae family. It's native to Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa. This plant can be an annual, sometimes lasting two years or being a short-lived perennial, growing up to 40-80 cm tall. In the USA, it's also called bladder campion, but it's different from Silene vulgaris, which is commonly referred to as Bladder Campion. \nGibraltar campion, a special plant called Silene tomentosa, is very hard to find. It's a small, woody plant that grows up to 40cm tall. Its flowers are either pink or light purple and it can only be found in Gibraltar. \nSilene conoidea is a type of plant from the pink family, often called weed silene or large sand catchfly. It's originally from Eurasia but has spread to western North America and is considered a weed there. This annual plant can grow up to a meter tall with a hairy stem that has glands. Its leaves are pointed and up to 12cm long near the base, gradually getting smaller. The flower is protected by a fuzzy, gland-covered calyx with many ridges and veins. When it opens, you'll find five bright pink petals. \nSilene stenophylla, also known as the narrow-leafed campion, is a pretty flowering plant that belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family. You can find it growing in the cold, snowy regions of far eastern Siberia and the mountain areas of Northern Japan. Scientists found some really old plant parts, about 32,000 years old, that they were able to bring back to life in 2012 by growing a new plant from them. \nMenzies' campion (Silene menziesii) is a pink flowering plant native to western North America, from Alaska to the southwest U.S. and western Canada. It's adaptable and commonly seen in various habitats. This plant is a perennial herb with a stem base (caudex), which can be mat-like, lying down, or upright, and can grow up to half a meter long. It has hairy leaves, usually green, with small upper leaves compared to the lower ones. Flowers can be in clusters at the stem's top or by the leaves, enclosed in a hairy calyx. Petals are white with two lobes and the plant is dioecious, meaning it has male and female flowers. The male and female flowers look similar but have different parts inside. \nSilene suksdorfii is a type of plant in the pink family, also called Suksdorf's silene, Cascade alpine campion, and Suksdorf's catchfly. It grows in the Pacific Northwest of the US, from Washington, Idaho to northern California, mostly in high mountain areas like talus and subalpine forests. It's a short-lived plant with thick stems that can reach up to 10-15cm, having a fuzzy texture and sticky glands on the top. The leaves are soft and hairy, growing in bunches around the woody base. Each flower is单独 on a stem, with a purple-veined calyx surrounding it, and white or purplish petals that have two lobes and extra parts at the bottom. \nThe plant Silene antirrhina, also called sleepy silene and sleepy catchfly, belongs to the pink family. It is originally from North and South America, but has been introduced to Europe. \nSilene is a special plant that has a way to make male and female babies. They have different parts called sex chromosomes, which are like X and Y. These chromosomes came about about 5 to 10 million years ago. Scientists love to study Silene because it's one of only 39 plants in 14 families that have genes that decide if a baby will be a boy or a girl. Silene is interesting because it can have many types of baby-making systems. People usually think the baby's gender is decided by the Y chromosome."}], "output": "\nYes, both Ferocactus and Silene are types of plant.

They started in 1916 and have flown many different types of planes, like fighters, bombers, and planes that help with surveillance. During World War I, they fought in Europe. They were stopped in 1919, but came back in 1922 and then again in 1937. They fought as bombers in World War II, Vietnam, and the Malayan Emergency. They stopped using their Canberra planes in 1982 and then started flying Boeing 737 planes for surveillance in 2000. In 2014, one of these planes went to the Middle East to help fight against ISIS. \nThe English Electric Canberra is a British jet-powered bomber that was built in the 1950s. It was created to replace the de Havilland Mosquito during the 1940s because the Air Ministry wanted a faster and more advanced bomber. The Canberra had to be able to fly high and drop bombs accurately from great heights, which is why they used new jet technology. When it was first used by the Royal Air Force in 1951, it became the first jet bomber they had.\nDuring World War II, the South West Pacific theatre was a big part of the fight between the Allies and Japan. It involved places like the Philippines, Dutch East Indies (except for Sumatra), Borneo, Australia, New Guinea (with Bismarck Archipelago), and the western Solomon Islands. The Allies had control of this area through their SWPA command. \nDuring World War II in the Pacific, from 1941 to 1945, the U.S. fought in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. There were two main groups under U.S. control: Admiral Nimitz led the Pacific Ocean Areas, which had three parts - Central, North, and South Pacific. General MacArthur was in charge of the South West Pacific Area. In 1945, a new group, the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, led by General Spaatz, joined in. \nThe Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 Sparviero, a wooden and metal airplane, was initially designed as a fast passenger jet. However, between 1937 and 1939, it broke 26 world records, making it the fastest medium bomber for a while. It entered combat during the Spanish Civil War and participated in all Italy's wars during World War II. In the Mediterranean theater, it excelled as a torpedo bomber and became well-known as the damned hunchback or il gobbo maledetto,因其 unique fuselage shape, and was much loved by its crew. \nDuring World War II, the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was a big group that led the Allies in a part of the Pacific called the South West Pacific Theatre. It was one of four important groups in the Pacific War. This group was in charge of places like the Philippines, Borneo, Dutch East Indies (except for Sumatra), East Timor, Australia, Papua and New Guinea, and part of the Solomon Islands. The main armies were from the United States and Australia, but other countries like the Dutch, Filipinos, British, and more also fought under SWPA. \nThe Tupolev Tu-12, also known as Tu-77, was a special airplane made in the Soviet Union after World War II. They made it from the Tu-2 bomber, which used regular engines.

The goal is to stay in control and navigate through the curve. When drifting, the car's back wheels move more than the front wheels, making them point in the opposite direction of the turn, like if you're turning left but the wheels point right (called opposite lock or counter-steering). \nD1NZ is the top drifting competition in New Zealand since there isn't an official drifting championship. It started in 2003 as a small event for local drifting teams to organize and control drifting matches. Over time, it grew bigger and more serious, now having professional drivers with sponsored cars.

They hired Jerry Glanville as their new coach and switched their helmet color to black. Despite improving from their previous year's 3-13 record, the team finished with a 5-11 win-loss record, which was not enough to make the playoffs for the eighth consecutive season. The season started strong with victories against Houston, New Orleans, and Cincinnati at home, putting them at 3-4. However, they lost seven games in a row before ending the season with two wins. They performed better at home (5-3) but struggled on the road, ultimately missing out on the playoffs due to their away record. \nThe Pittsburgh Steelers are an American football team in the National Football League.

The name 'Libocedrus' comes from the appearance of resin droplets on the trees. \nPilgerodendron is a type of conifer tree that belongs to the cypress family. It is native to the Valdivian rainforests and Magellanic subpolar forests in southern Chile and Argentina. The only species, Pilgerodendron uviferum, can be found in the southernmost region of Tierra del Fuego, making it the farthest south conifer tree.

Bacha was also involved in the high-profile case of Robert Durst, a New York millionaire accused of murdering his neighbor Morris Black in Galveston, Texas. However, Durst was acquitted of murder by a Galveston County jury.\nBarend is a Dutch name that can be used as a first or middle name. In 2014, many people in the Netherlands (around 4,000 as first name and 3,000 as middle name) had this name. It might come from the name Bernard. Some famous people with this name are: \nMarion Christopher Barry was born in June 1980 to Marion Barry and his third wife, Effi Slaughter Barry. He is their only child. Initially, his father planned to name him Marion Barry III, but his mother didn't agree. They named him Christopher instead.

This crime drama was shown on CBS on October 3, 2004. \nIn Latvia, like most European countries, people have two parts to their name: a first name (vārds) and a last name (uzvārds). During the time the Soviet Union controlled Latvia (1940 to 1991), they didn't encourage having a middle name. But after Latvia regained its independence, the rules changed, and now people can give their kids up to two first names, including a middle name, which is more common now. \nThe word Singh comes from India and means lion. It was originally used by some strong warrior groups. Guru Gobind Singh made it a requirement for Sikhs. Now, it's not just for Sikhs but also used by many other groups in India and by Indian people living outside of it. It's more like a title than just a last name. \nJeff Strabone is a Brooklyn-based American academic, activist, and community leader.

He worked in St Augustine and got a special job to talk nicely with the native people living near St Augustine, especially those in the Cape Canaveral area. Because of his mission, there was a time when both Spanish and Ais people got along really well. \nBefore Europeans arrived in Florida, Indigenous peoples had been living there for over 12,000 years. Unfortunately, by the early 18th century, most Florida's original inhabitants were no longer present. Some Apalachee people moved to Louisiana and their descendants still reside there. Others were taken to Cuba and Mexico by the Spanish during the 18th century, and a small number might have been assimilated into the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes.\nThe High Commission of Australia in London is the place where Australia represents itself in the United Kingdom. It can be found in a special building called Australia House, which is an important historical site. This building has a Grade II listing and has been there since the beginning, making it the oldest Australian diplomatic mission still in use in the UK. \nA diplomatic mission is a group of people from one country or organization sent to another country to represent them officially. An embassy, which is usually located in the capital city, is a type of diplomatic mission where the country's representatives work. Consulates are similar but not located in the capital. A diplomatic mission can also be in a non-capital city and have connections to other countries, so we have both resident (in the capital) and non-resident embassies. \nA diplomatic bag is a special container that helps carry important papers or items between a country's embassy and their home country. It can look like a box, briefcase, or big bag, and usually has a lock or special seal to keep it safe. The most important thing is that it has special rights called diplomatic immunity, which means nobody can open or take it without permission. The bag can only have things meant for official use, and it's often carried by a special person called a diplomatic courier, who also can't be arrested or detained. \nThe Embassy of China in London is the official place where China communicates with the United Kingdom. This embassy is unique because it's the only one China has in the UK, and they also have two smaller offices in Edinburgh and Manchester. This special building has a long history, starting in 1877 as China's first foreign office. It was there during the Qing Empire, Republic of China, and now the People's Republic of China. A very important event, the detention of Sun Yat-sen, happened there in 1911. The embassy still plays a big role in events about China in the UK, like the celebrations they had in 2012 to celebrate 40 years of friendship between the UK and China. \nThe Embassy of the United States in Kenya, also called Embassy Nairobi, is where the US represents its relationship with Kenya. It opened in 1964 when the US started its diplomatic ties with Kenya. In 1998, there was a terrorist attack on the original embassy, so a new one was built in a place called Gigiri in 2003. The US also uses this embassy for its work in Somalia. \nAzerbaijan started being friends with other countries a long time ago, during the Safavids dynasty in the 16th century. They officially had a foreign affairs department, or ministry, in 1918 when they became an independent republic for the first time. Their first minister was Mehmet Hasan Hacınkski. They made their first international agreement, the Pact of Peace and Friendship, with the Ottoman State and this is when the Ottoman State became the first to recognize their independence. They also signed a friendship treaty with Iran in 1919 and opened consulates in cities like Tehran.\n\nBut in 1920, things changed when the Russian army came to Baku. Later, in 1991, after a movement for independence, Azerbaijan regained its freedom on February 5th. Since then, they've been building relationships with more countries and now have embassies and consulates in over 70 nations, including recent ones in Brazil, Australia, and Vietnam. \nIn simple terms, a head of mission (like an ambassador or consul) is the top person in charge of a foreign country's office in another country. They might be called different things like chief of mission or ambassador. Sometimes, it's also used for leaders of big international groups. In some places, the second-in-command is called a deputy head of mission or deputy chief of mission. \nThe United States Mission to the European Union (USEU) is the American embassy in Brussels, Belgium, where the US represents its interests in the European Union. The US has had a diplomatic relationship with the EU and its earlier forms since 1953. Initially, in 1956, there was a US embassy for the European Coal and Steel Community in Luxembourg. Later, in 1961, the embassy was moved to Brussels and became the United States Mission to the European Union when it was created in 1993."}], "output": "\nAis.**"},

He learned from Edmund Leach and Raymond Firth and conducted field research in Melanesia and tribal India. Gell was a respected teacher at the London School of Economics and a Fellow of the British Academy.

Bošković has taught at various universities around the world and was recently appointed as the EASA Book Series Editor and co-convenor of the History of Anthropology Network. \nParticipant observation is a way to collect information in qualitative research. It involves being closely involved with a specific group of people and their activities for a long time, usually in their own environment. This method is popular in cultural anthropology and some related fields like ethnology, but not as much in sociology, communication studies, geography, and social psychology. It was first used by famous researchers like Bronisław Malinowski and Franz Boas. \nMuted Group Theory, created by Edwin and Shirley Ardener in 1975, focuses on the relationship between a powerful group and the group(s) they dominate. The dominant group shapes the language, including its rules and words. The subordinate group has to use this language, but it can lead to misunderstandings because they might not express themselves fully or accurately. The dominant group might also ignore their ideas. This theory, initially used to understand women's and men's experiences, can also apply to any group that feels silenced due to the limitations of their language. \nThe Association of Social Anthropologists in the UK and Commonwealth is a group that helps support the study of psychosocial issues. They are part of a bigger group called the Academy of Social Sciences. \nBronisław Malinowski's book Coral Gardens and Their Magic is the last in a series about the Trobriand Islanders. It focuses on how the locals cultivate plants like yams, taro, bananas, and palms. The book sees their gardens as not just practical but also artistic expressions. In 1988, Alfred Gell praised it as the best explanation of a primitive system combining technology and magic and believed it would remain unmatched. Many consider this book Malinowski's greatest work."}], "output": "\nBritish and British.**"},

People asked the county to build a new jail because the granary wasn't good enough. Some people in Minden didn't want Gardnerville to become the main town, so they tried to stop it, but the jail was still built. The new jail got its first prisoners when the old one burned down. It worked as the county jail until 1915 when Minden became the county seat and built its own jail. \nLempster is a small town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, with a population of 1,154 people according to the 2010 census.

Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional? \n\n Passage: \nThe Supreme Court ruled in Rostker v. Goldberg (1981) that it was okay for the law to only require men to register for the draft. Before that, Congress talked a lot about the issue, and they decided to keep the law the same, just for men. Some lawyers, like Robert L. Goldberg, said this was unfair to women. But in the end, the Court decided that the law was constitutional because it treated men and women differently, and the law stayed the same. \nConscription, or the draft, has been used by the US government in four wars: Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (which included Korea and Vietnam). In 1940, the draft was introduced for the first time during peace time, to fill gaps in the army with mandatory enlistment. Men between 18 and 25 are still required to register with the Selective Service System, just in case a draft becomes necessary again. The military now only has volunteers, so the draft ended.\nOn May 9, 2010, Kiev celebrated Victory Day to remember the 65th anniversary of the Soviet Union's win in the Great Patriotic War.

They want to receive the same pension as their peers with the same rank and years of service, no matter when they retire. This idea came about because in 1973, after India won a big war with Bangladesh, the government led by Indira Gandhi (from the Indian National Congress party) made a sudden change. They reduced pensions for soldiers by 20-40% and increased civilian pensions by 20%, without talking to the military leaders first. This caused a fair pay issue for the armed forces, which led to the demand for OROP. <ref name=V Mahalingam, 21/9></ref> \nThe Chief of the Defence Staff is the second-in-command of Canada's military, just below the Commander-in-Chief.

It's not a strict legal rule, but both the government and military take it very seriously.

This day is to remember a big win from 1920 when Poland fought and beat Russia. It's also close to another holiday, when the Virgin Mary's believed to be taken up to heaven. On this day, the Polish military shows off their stuff with parades, displays, and ceremonies all around the country. In Warsaw, the capital, there's a big parade with lots of cool military stuff. They didn't celebrate this holiday during a time called communism, but they started again in 1992. \nIn June 1941, President Roosevelt issued an important order called Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC). This order aimed to stop discrimination against African-Americans in the federal government and companies that got government contracts. Because of this, many black people and women got better jobs and better pay. Before this, the Army and Navy were separate, but African-American leaders became more influential, especially after they mostly started voting for Democrats. In response to a request from A. Philip Randolph, an important black trade unionist, Roosevelt agreed to ban discrimination by the government and even the military. However, the military found ways to avoid this, and it was President Truman who finally desegregated the armed forces in 1942."}], "output": "\nSelective Service System.**"},

It was filmed in Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ, and at Montezuma Castle National Monument. The local Yavapai Indians, who worked as extras, wouldn't go inside the cliff dwellings because they believed it was where the dead lived. This caused a delay because the filmmakers had to bring in Navajos from 137 miles away to replace them. \nThe Montezuma Castle National Monument in Camp Verde, Arizona, is a special place that protects old houses made by the Sinagua people. These people lived a long time ago, from around 1100 to 1425 AD, before Christopher Columbus came. The main house has five levels and twenty rooms, and it was built slowly over 300 years.\nThe Château de Druyes is a medieval castle in Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines, Yonne, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. It was built by the Counts of Nevers in the 12th century and remained in their family until the 18th century. This castle served both as a fancy home and a fortified structure. It was a popular place for Peter II of Courtenay, who was the Emperor of Constantinople in the 13th century, and his daughter Matilda, who was a Countess of Nevers, Auxerre, and Tonnerre. \nHeaven, referred to as Shamayim in Hebrew (meaning the heavens), is one part of the three main parts of the universe, which also includes the Earth (Eretz) and the Underworld (Sheol). Heaven is where God and other celestial beings reside, Earth is where people live, and Sheol is the place where the dead, including the righteous in some religious texts, go after they pass away. \nIn simple terms, Andlang is a special place in Norse mythology, like a big house. It comes after the first house where gods live and before the third one called Vídbláin. There are nine houses total, according to a storyteller named Snorri. When the big event called Ragnarök happens and the world ends, Andlang will be a safe place for the souls of people who have passed away. \nThe Tabernacle was a special tent that God lived in with the Israelites after they left Egypt. It was made of curtains and shiny gold-covered boards. They put it together using instructions from God given to Moses. The Israelites carried it with them when they moved and when they took over a new land. Later, a bigger and even more special temple, Solomon's Temple, became God's home instead. \nIn simple terms, an inquiline is an animal that lives in someone else's home, like a renter, but instead of a house, it's a nest, burrow, or place where another animal lives. These inquilines often live with social insects like ants and termites, and they don't harm the host. They might feed on scraps or other things nearby. The difference between inquilines and parasites is that parasites hurt the host, but inquilines don't. It's a bit confusing, but inquilines are the nice, non-harmful ones living together. \nAccording to Norse mythology, Víðbláinn is the third heaven mentioned in Snorri's Gylfaginning. It comes after Andlang and Asgard. During and after a big event called Ragnarök, Víðbláinn will be a safe place for the souls of people who have passed away. \nTo determine the oldest synagogue in the UK, we need to consider a few factors. Some synagogues were found in old buildings that have served other purposes for a long time, predating when Jews left England. After Jews returned in the 1600s, some new synagogues were built. Some old synagogues were destroyed and later rebuilt, so even though the location or group is old, the building might be new. Some synagogues were sold and now serve as different places like churches or schools. Lastly, some truly ancient synagogues have been used continuously for centuries without any major changes. \nTo be considered the oldest synagogue in the world, we need to define it carefully. Many ancient synagogues have been found during excavations. Some synagogues have been rebuilt several times, making the current structure relatively new despite its location or the age of the community. Some very old buildings once used as synagogues are now used for other purposes like churches or mosques. However, a few synagogues have remained in continuous use as synagogues for centuries without any major changes."}], "output": "\nOver 300 years.**"},

You can still watch it in the extra features of the 2012 DVD version of the film. \nMichael Finnegan, also known as Michael Finnagen or Michael Vinnegan, is a very long song that can have many versions and keep going as long as the singer wants or can. Kids, especially at school, often sing it during fun activities like campfire sing-alongs or scouting events.

It was used in the Royal Navy's armor-piercing shells a long time ago, around the start of the 1900s. \nPicric acid is a bitter-tasting organic compound called 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) with the chemical formula (ON)CHOH. It's highly acidic and known for its explosive nature, which once made it popular for use as an explosive. Nowadays, it has medical applications, like being used as an antiseptic and for burn treatments, and it's also used in dyes.\nIsopropyl alcohol, also known as propan-2-ol or dimethyl carbinol (not isopropanol), is a clear, flammable liquid with a strong smell. It's a type of alcohol where the alcohol carbon is connected to two other carbon atoms, making it a secondary alcohol. It's different from 1-propanol and used in many things like cleaning products, disinfectants, and detergents because it's so versatile. \nAlcohol is a type of molecule where a water-like part (-OH) is attached to a carbon atom. Simple alcohol forms have a basic structure like CHOH, and ethanol, which is in drinks we call alcoholic, is the most common type. Other articles about alcohol talk about related topics. \nTHPC, or Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride, is a special kind of molecule that has the shape of a four-coordinate phosphorus compound. It's often used to create fire-resistant materials. \n1-Hexanol is a clear liquid alcohol with six carbon atoms, represented by CH(CH)OH. It doesn't mix well with water but can be mixed with diethyl ether and ethanol. There are two more similar alcohol types called 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, where the hydroxyl group is in a different spot. Other alcohols with the formula CHOH are also found. This alcohol is used in making perfumes. \n1-Pentanol, also known as n-pentanol or pentan-1-ol, is a clear liquid alcohol with five carbon atoms and the chemical formula CHOH. It has a strong, unpleasant smell. This specific type of alcohol is the straight, unbranched version of amyl alcohol, which is one of many possible versions with the same chemical structure. \nAldonic acids are a type of sugar acid that are formed when the aldehyde part of an aldose is changed into a carboxylic acid group through a chemical reaction called oxidation. Their structure can be represented as HOOC-(CHOH)-CHOH. If the terminal (end) hydroxyl group is oxidized instead of the aldehyde, it turns into a uronic acid. And if both ends are oxidized, you get an aldaric acid. \nXylitol is a sweetener called a sugar alcohol. It comes from the Greek words for wood and -itol, which are used for sugar alcohols. It's a type of polyalcohol. It has a special chemical structure like a part of a plant called pentane. Studies show that xylitol helps fix early tooth decay by strengthening the enamel. Using xylitol products like gum, lozenges, or nasal spray can also lower the chances of kids getting ear infections. \nWhen you mix a dielectric material with a metal, their conductivity (conductivity formula_1) and how well it can store electricity (dielectric constant formula_2) act differently near a special point called the percolation threshold. As the metal part gets more, the conductivity smoothly changes from the dielectric's to the metal's. There are two important numbers, s and t, that help explain this change. The dielectric constant becomes very big when you get close to the threshold from either side. To account for how these properties change with frequency, we use a model called the resistor-capacitor model (R-C model)."}], "output": "\nPicric acid.**"},

Many top Argentine golfers, such as Eduardo Romero (8 wins), José Jurado (7 wins), Vicente Fernández (5 wins), José Cóceres (2 wins), and Ángel Cabrera, have participated and won. However, Roberto De Vicenzo, a former British Open champion, holds the record with an impressive 16 victories between 1944 and 1985. \nRoberto De Vicenzo was a professional golfer from Argentina who won over 230 tournaments worldwide, including eight on the PGA Tour and the prestigious 1967 Open Championship. He was born on April 14, 1923, and unfortunately passed away on June 1, 2017.\nHenry Picard won the 1939 PGA Championship, a golf tournament, by defeating Byron Nelson at Pomonok Country Club in Queens, New York. This was Picard's only win in the PGA Championship, but he had already won the Masters in 1938. Nelson had previously won the U.S. Open three months earlier and would go on to win the next PGA Championship in 1940. From 1939 to 1945, Nelson reached the finals of the PGA Championship five times and won again in 1945. \nThe Middle Atlantic PGA Championship is a golf competition that decides the best players in the Middle Atlantic region of the PGA of America.

Both players scored an impressive 18 under par, which tied the PGA Championship record. Woods broke this record again in 2006. It was a historic moment because it was the first time since 1937 that someone defended their PGA Championship title, and it was the first time it happened in stroke play format. Woods and May were five shots ahead of Thomas Bjørn, who finished third. \nThe Northern California PGA Championship is a golf competition that crowns the best players from the PGA of America's Northern California region. Mark Fry, who works as a pro at Sequoyah Country Club in Oakland, has won the most times with 10 victories.

Lanny Wadkins, who was 27 years old, won his only major title in a sudden-death playoff against Gene Littler. This was the first playoff in the PGA Championship in ten years and marked the first time a sudden-death playoff happened in a stroke-play major championship. The last time this happened was way back in 1941 during the PGA Championship, where the final match went on for two extra holes after 36 holes. \nThe 1940 PGA Championship was the 23rd of its kind and took place from August 26 to September 2 at Hershey Country Club in Hershey, Pennsylvania, near Harrisburg. This event was a match play competition where Byron Nelson emerged victorious, winning his first PGA Championship by defeating Sam Snead 1 to 0 in a 36-hole final. This was the beginning of Nelson's impressive record, as he went on to win the championship again in 1945.

It was made to honor 329 soldiers from the 66th Berkshire Regiment who sadly died during a big war called the Second Anglo-Afghan War between 1878 and 1880. People also call it the Forbury Lion sometimes. \nThe Reading Post, also known as the Reading Evening Post until 2009, was a newspaper about the town of Reading and nearby places in Berkshire, England.

So, they asked Lutyens to make a different kind of memorial, called a War Cross. They picked a spot on the cathedral's green after looking at many places.

He was the son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, who named their clan Clann Domhnaill, a part of Clann Somhairle. Aonghus Mór took over after his father in the middle of the century. At that time, the leaders of the Isles were not very connected to the Scottish government and only gave a small loyalty to the Norwegian king. Aonghus Mór's first known event shows him helping local Irish groups fight against the growing power of the Anglo-Irish in northwest Ireland. This might have been because clans like Clann Domhnaill formed alliances with the Irish to get support against Scottish expansion. \nThe Kingdom of the Isles existed from the 9th to the 13th century and included the Hebrides, islands near the Firth of Clyde, and the Isle of Man. The Norse called these islands the Suðreyjar, meaning Southern Isles, different from the Norðreyjar or Northern Isles in Orkney and Shetland. The history of this kingdom is not well-documented, and it wasn't always a stable entity. The rulers sometimes acted independently, but often answered to overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland, or Orkney. There were also disagreements about who owned what part of the land. The total area of these islands is over 8,300 square kilometers, stretching over 500 kilometers from north to south. Some rulers referred to their kingdom as Mann and the Isles, but not all of them.\nBefore the late 14th century, the leaders of Clann Domhnaill were known as Lords of Islay. Aonghus Mór, the son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, was one of the first to call himself Lord of Islay. This title was often used by their family members, especially those from Clann Domhnaill. \nHimachal Pradesh has almost 37,691 square kilometers of forests, which is around 38.3% of the entire state. Forests once provided significant income, but now the focus is on protecting and saving them. The government wants to increase forest coverage to half of the total land area. They've started projects like creating National Parks to keep and grow forests. \nThe Ashanti Region is the third biggest area in Ghana, located in the south, and covers about 10% of the country's total land. It has the highest population, with almost 4.8 million people, which is around 19% of Ghana's total. This region is famous for producing gold and cocoa. The main city and capital of the Ashanti Region is Kumasi. \nTasmania is the southernmost and smallest state in Australia, consisting mainly of an island called Tasmania. The main island covers 64,103 square kilometers, which is 94.1% of the state's total land area. The next eleven biggest islands combined take up 3,826 square kilometers, adding up to almost the entire state (99.75%). There are also around 300 smaller islands, but together they only account for 173 square kilometers, which is a very small part of the total land. \nJaluit Atoll is a big coral island group in the Pacific Ocean with 91 islands. It's part of the Marshall Islands and has a special area called a legislative district. The Ralik Chain is nearby. The land is spread across 11.34 square kilometers, mostly on the biggest island called Jaluit, which is about 10.4 square kilometers. There's also a big lagoon with an area of 690 square kilometers. It's close to a place called Majuro, about 220 kilometers away. Jaluit Atoll is important for nature and is a protected area for conservation and wetlands. \nThe Philippines is a group of islands with 7,641 of them. Out of these, the 11 biggest islands cover 95% of the total land area. The biggest island is Luzon, which is about as big as the whole country, and the second-largest island is Mindanao. The islands are far away from the Asian mainland, around 800 kilometers, and are positioned between Taiwan and Borneo. \nTaiwan has nine protected areas called national parks. These parks are cared for by the Ministry of the Interior and together, they cover 7,489.49 square kilometers, which is about 8.6% of the country's land. These parks are special because they protect nature, animals, and the country's history. \nThe Kingdom of the Isles existed from the 9th to the 13th century and included the Hebrides, islands near the Firth of Clyde, and the Isle of Man. The Norse called these islands the Suðreyjar, meaning Southern Isles, different from the Norðreyjar, or Northern Isles, which are Orkney and Shetland. This kingdom wasn't always a solid group and its history is not well-documented. The rulers sometimes acted independently, but often answered to Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland, or Orkney.

This design allows for more efficient burning of the wick and oil, which means the wick needs to be trimmed much less often. \nThe Lewis lamp is a special light used in big, tall buildings called lighthouses. A man named Winslow Lewis made it in 1810 and it's better than older lamps because it uses less oil. It looks a bit like another lamp called the Argand lamp, but has a round mirror behind it and a big, green glass lens in front. Another version with a mirror was made by Aimé Argand, but the United States chose Lewis' design for their lighthouses.\nA hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is a special lamp used in science to make light with specific colors (for testing atoms) and to control the frequency of lasers. It works better than a normal cold cathode lamp because it has a empty space inside the cathode, which lets more electricity flow at lower voltage. \nAntoine Quinquet, a French pharmacist, was born in Soissons on March 9, 1745.

It has a wick or a special material (mantle) inside a glass chimney or globe. These lamps can be placed on tables or used as portable hand-held lanterns. They are useful when there's no electricity, like in areas without power, during blackouts, at outdoor activities like camping, and on boats. There are three main types: flat wick for portable ones, central draught (round wick), and mantle lamp. The portable kerosene lanterns have a flat wick and come in different versions for different flame control. \nA glow switch starter is a device used with fluorescent lamps to help them start. It has neon or argon gas inside and has a bimetallic strip and a fixed electrode. When electricity flows, the gas heats the strip, making it bend towards the electrode, which connects the lamp. This helps the lamp start. After a while, the strip cools and disconnects, repeating until the lamp lights up. However, when the lamp gets old, the starter might keep turning on and off rapidly until it fails or the lamp's electrode burns out. \nThe qulliq is a special lamp that Arctic people, like the Inuit, Chukchi, and Yupik, have used for a long time. It's made from things like seal oil, blubber, or soapstone. \nA trouble light is a special lamp that shines light in hard-to-see areas and can handle some rough treatment. It has a bulb inside a strong case with a handle, which makes it one piece. The cord is long so you can reach far, and sometimes there's an electrical outlet on the handle, so it can also be used as an extension cord. \nThe Hefner lamp, also known as Hefnerkerze in German, is a special lamp used in studying light that burns a substance called amyl acetate. \nNikola Tesla invented the carbon button lamp, a simple lamp with a tiny carbon ball inside a glass bulb with no air. It needs special high-frequency electricity to create an electric arc, which heats the carbon and makes it glow.

People in the plant business call it Lc. for short. \nBroughtonia is a type of special plant called an orchid. It comes from two places, the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles. People in the business world use a short name for it, which is Bro.\nBroughtonia sanguinea, another name for Blood Red Broughtonia, is a special plant that belongs to the Broughtonia group, which is part of the big plant family called Orchidaceae. People in the plant world sometimes use the short name Bro when talking about it in trade books. \nWilliam Henry Nicholls was a talented Australian amateur botanist who specialized in studying and collecting Australian orchids. He was also skilled in photography and painting, especially watercolors. Nicholls wrote over 100 articles about orchids for a magazine called The Victorian Naturalist, many of which featured new species with detailed drawings. His goal was to create a 24-volume book with pictures of all Australian orchids, but unfortunately, he passed away before completing it. Only four volumes were published after his death, but later, in 1969, all his work was compiled into one book called Orchids of Australia. Some of the orchids he discovered and named, like Caladenia caudata and Pterostylis fischii, still carry his name today. \nOtaara, often abbreviated as Otr. in the gardening world, is a special kind of orchid that comes from mixing five different parent orchid species: Brassavola, Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia, and Sophronitis. \nDuck orchids, also called Paracaleana, are a type of flowering plant from the orchid family found in both Australia and New Zealand. These plants are similar to Caleana major but have unique features. The flowers are not very showy, with dull colors, and they attract male thynnid wasps for pollination. These orchids have just one leaf and can have one or a few flowers. It's important to note that they haven't been found in the Northern Territory of Australia. \nSpider orchids, a type of plant from the orchid family, have 350 different kinds. They are ground plants with a single hairy leaf and stem. Their flowers have special parts, like fringes or teeth, to attract specific insects for help in making babies (pollination). Spider orchids are divided into three groups based on their flower shape: spider, zebra, and cowslip. Most of these plants are found in Australia, especially in Western Australia, where there are 136 species, making it the place with the most types of these flowers. \nBeard orchids, or Calochilus, are a group of around 30 types of plants from the orchid family. They are land-based, plant-like herbs with either one leaf or no leaves at their base. They're called beard orchids because their special part, called the labellum, has lots of hair. These orchids don't spread by making baby plants like some other Australian orchids do. They can either self-pollinate if there's no other orchid around to help, or they need cross-pollination. Most beard orchids are found in Australia, but a few can also be found in places like New Zealand, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. \nCattleytonia is a special kind of hybrid orchid that comes from two other orchid families called Cattleya and Broughtonia.

It lasted for a month and caused a lot of destruction, with many civilians losing their lives and the city being almost completely ruined. This was the worst fighting in the Pacific during World War II. The Japanese also hurt a lot of innocent people. After this battle, the Japanese stopped controlling the Philippines. This victory was important for General Douglas MacArthur's plan to take back the country. \nDuring the American Civil War, there was a big fight called the Seven Days Battles. It happened from June 25 to July 1, 1862, close to a place called Richmond, Virginia. Confederate leader Robert E. Lee and his team stopped the Union Army, led by General George B. McClellan, from going near Richmond. The Union Army had to run away towards the Virginia Peninsula. Some people wrongly call this fight the Seven Days Campaign, but it was actually the last part of a bigger plan called the Peninsula Campaign.\nThis paragraph explains that it lists the Confederate Army units and their leaders who participated in the Seven Days Battles between June 25 and July 1, 1862, during the American Civil War. The information is based on the army's structure at the time, records of casualties, and battle reports, with a separate list for the Union army. \nThis paragraph is about the groups of soldiers and their leaders from the Union Army who fought in a big battle called the Seven Days Battles from June 25 to July 1, 1862, during the American Civil War. It talks about organizing their positions and includes information from reports about what happened during the battle. The list for the Confederate soldiers is in a different part. \nThe Battle of Cross Keys, which took place on June 8, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, was a significant part of Confederate General Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War. This battle, along with the one at Port Republic the next day, were crucial wins for Jackson's Valley Campaign. These victories made the Union armies retreat and allowed Jackson to strengthen General Robert E. Lee's forces for the battles around Richmond, Virginia. \nThe Battle of Gaines's Mill, also called the First Battle of Cold Harbor or the Chickahominy River battle, was a big event during the American Civil War on June 27, 1862. After a close but not decisive battle the day before, Confederate General Robert E. Lee wanted to attack the Union Army's right side, which was alone near the Chickahominy River. Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's group had set up a strong defense near Boatswain's Swamp. Lee had a huge army of around 57,000 people, and they attacked Porter's group in a messy way. The Union troops fought hard, especially when the Confederate leaders A.P. Hill and Richard S. Ewell attacked, causing many losses. But Stonewall Jackson's troops didn't arrive on time, so Porter got some help from the VI Corps before the full Confederate force could be brought together. \nSavage's Station was a place during the American Civil War where the Army of the Potomac kept supplies, stored ammunition, had a field hospital, and a command center. It was in Henrico County, Virginia, on a train line called the Richmond and York River Railroad. There might have been a train station there once, but the current owner, Norfolk Southern Railroad, doesn't have any records of it. There was a house nearby, which was important during the Seven Pines and Seven Days Battles. General George B. McClellan used it as his headquarters during one of those battles. The house was destroyed by Federal forces in 1864, and it was never rebuilt. A smokehouse from the 1800s was found on the property too, but it fell apart by the 1980s. There's also a small old cemetery near where the house used to be, close to the train track. \nThe Battle of Port Republic took place on June 9, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia. It was a part of a bigger event during the American Civil War where Confederate Army's Major General Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson was attacking the Shenandoah Valley. The battle was intense and costly for Jackson's Army of the Valley. Before Port Republic, there was another battle called Cross Keys. Both of these victories helped Jackson's team win the Valley Campaign, making the Union armies retreat. This allowed Jackson to join forces with Gen. Robert E. Lee for more battles near Richmond, Virginia. \nThe Northern Virginia Campaign, also known as the Second Bull Run or Second Manassas Campaign, was a series of battles in Virginia during August and September 1862 during the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee, who had won earlier battles in the Peninsula Campaign, continued his advance towards Washington, D.C., and defeated the Army of Virginia led by Maj. Gen. John Pope. \nThe Battle of Malvern Hill, also called the Battle of Poindexter's Farm, was a big fight that happened on July 1, 1862. It was between two armies during the American Civil War: the Confederate Army, led by Gen. Robert E. Lee, and the Union Army, commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan. This battle was the last in a series of seven days of fighting called the Seven Days Battles. It took place on a hill called Malvern Hill, which is about 130 feet tall and close to Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital.

It showed pretend scenes from 12 famous movies using cool things like talking characters, real sets, actors, special effects, and movie projections. It opened on May 1, 1989, and was inside a pretend version of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, a super popular movie theater in Hollywood.\nThe song I Love to Laugh from the movie Mary Poppins is about Uncle Albert and Bert floating in the air because they're happy and laughing. This happens when they're not sad, like when they think of something unhappy, they come back down. The song shows how laughter is good and can make people feel better, even if it sometimes causes problems, like when it makes Bert and the kids float too. Mary Poppins might not like it, but the song says laughing is important. \nStep In Time is a song and dance scene from the 1964 Disney movie Mary Poppins. It was written by Richard and Robert Sherman, and the dance moves were created by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood. In the song, chimney sweep Bert (played by Dick Van Dyke) and his friends sing and dance on London rooftops. They do fun actions like kicking their knees up and flapping like birds. During the dance, Admiral Boom mistakes them for a different group and uses fireworks to make them leave. Later, Mrs. Brill is shocked to see the chimney sweeps inside and tries to chase them away with a frying pan. The kids and Mary Poppins join in, and there are more fun phrases like Votes for women and What's all this? throughout the scene. \nMy Kind of Town is a famous song written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn. It was in the movie Robin and the 7 Hoods from 1964, which had famous actors from the Rat Pack. The song was up for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1964 but didn't win; instead, Chim Chim Cher-ee from Mary Poppins took the prize. Although the Grammy category for Best Original Song from a movie didn't exist when My Kind of Town was made, the whole movie's music was nominated for Best Original Score for a Movie that year, but again, Mary Poppins won. \nA Man Has Dreams is a song from the movie Mary Poppins, made by the Disney brothers, Sherman. It's a slower version of another song called The Life I Lead that the character George Banks sings when he loses his job. Bert, the chimney sweep, and George sing it together like they're having a chat. It's a special kind of singing called an operatic duet, which was new for movies back then. The song also includes a part of A Spoonful of Sugar, Mary Poppins's special tune. \nMary Poppins Opens the Door is a fun storybook for kids written by an Australian-British author named P.L. Travers. It's the third and final book in the Mary Poppins series, where we meet the magical nanny who helps families in England. The book was published in 1943 with beautiful pictures drawn by Mary Shepard and Agnes Sims, and it was made by a company called Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc. \nMary Poppins Returns is a new musical movie that is a follow-up to the original Mary Poppins from 1964. It's directed by Rob Marshall and the script is by David Magee. Emily Blunt, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and many others star in the film. The story takes place 25 years later, where Mary Poppins, who used to take care of Jane and Michael Banks, comes back to help them after a sad event. This movie will come out on December 25, 2018, and it's unique because it has a very long time between the first and second films. \nMary Poppins is a 1964 Disney movie that combines live-action and animation. It's directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by Walt Disney. The film features Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, a magical nanny who helps a struggling family in London by teaching them fun and positive life lessons. Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, and Glynis Johns play important roles too. The entire movie was filmed at the Walt Disney Studios in California, using pretend backgrounds of London. The music and songs were written by the Sherman Brothers. It's based on P. L. Travers' book series about Mary Poppins. \nIn the 2015 stage musical Love Birds, there's a song called Mary Poppins written by Robert J. Sherman. A group of penguin singers, called The Original Quack Pack, who look like the penguins from the 1964 Disney movie, sing it. They clarify they're not the same penguins as in the film. The song is about their wish to have the famous magical nanny, Mary Poppins."}], "output": "\n1989.**"},

He is the Chairman of Westfield Corporation, which is a big company that owns and manages shopping centers in the US, UK, and Europe, with a worth of $29.3 billion. He used to be in charge of Scentre Group, the group that takes care of Westfield shopping centers in Australia and New Zealand. \nAustralia tried to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup but didn't succeed. FIFA chose Qatar for the event. They also tried for the 2018 World Cup but pulled out. The 2018 and 2022 editions will be the 21st and 22nd of the tournament. In 2009, countries could apply, but Australia's bid team, led by Frank Lowy, Elle Macpherson, and others, didn't win. Their chances could improve if FIFA takes away Qatar's hosting rights due to controversies.\nQatar wanted to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. There are allegations that they bribed officials to get the hosting rights, which led to the resignation of FIFA President Sepp Blatter. Qatar, a small country with 2 million people, will be the first Arab country to host the World Cup. \nIn 2009, Russia said they wanted to host the FIFA World Cup and officially asked FIFA. President Vladimir Putin is very interested and made sure Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, worked on a plan. Russia is prepared to spend $10 billion to host the event in 2018. Vitaly Mutko, RFU President, and other important people like Alexey Sorokin and Alexander Djordjadze are part of the team. However, in 2010, Russia decided not to try for the 2022 World Cup. On December 2, 2010, they were chosen to host the 2018 event. \nThe Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) made their first attempt to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022. However, on March 19, 2010, FIFA said no because they didn't have enough support from the government. Indonesia wanted to bring the big soccer tournament back to Asia after it was held in Japan and South Korea in 2002. A long time ago, in 1938, Indonesia, then known as the Dutch East Indies, was the first Asian team to play in the World Cup, but they lost to Hungary in the first game. \nJapan made a bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, which would have been their second time hosting the event. The first time was in 2002 when they co-hosted with South Korea. If they had won, Japan would have become the sixth country to host the tournament twice, following Italy, France, Mexico, Brazil, and West Germany. On May 4, 2010, the Japanese Football Association decided to focus solely on winning the hosting rights for 2022. \nThe FIFA decided where the 2018 and 2022 World Cups would be held. In 2009, they started getting applications from 13 countries, but some later dropped out. Nine countries remained, some wanting to host both events. Eventually, all non-European bids for 2018 were dropped, and European countries didn't get a chance for 2022. In 2010, England, Russia, Belgium-Netherlands, Portugal-Spain, Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, the US, and Mexico (but later pulled out) were still in the running. Indonesia's bid was rejected because they didn't have government support. \nThe Korea Football Association (KFA) tried to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup for the second time. If they succeeded, it would be their second time hosting the event, but this time they wanted to do it alone, not with Japan like in 2002. Han Sung-joo, the head of the committee, hoped that even if South Korea got the bid, they could include North Korea in the event. \nThe United States Soccer Federation initially aimed to host the 2018 FIFA World Cup in 2007 but later decided to focus on the 2022 edition. They submitted bids for both years but withdrew from the 2018 bid in 2010. Qatar was eventually chosen as the host for the 2022 World Cup. FIFA, it seems, wanted to promote soccer globally by selecting a non-traditional host like Qatar. Bill Clinton mentioned that they were in a giving mood, making soccer more accessible to the world. \nMorocco wants to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup and is competing against a bid from Canada, Mexico, and the United States.

It's about a real-life story from 1987 where a high school in McFarland, California, with mostly Latino students, had a cross country team. Kevin Costner plays the coach, Jim White, who helps the team win a big state title. Maria Bello and Morgan Saylor are also in the movie. Disney and Mayhem Pictures helped make it happen. \nDinosaur is a fun 2000 animated movie made by Walt Disney. It's their 39th animated film, and it uses computer animation. In the UK, they don't call it one of their classic animated films, instead, they count The Wild from 2006 as part of their collection.\nCinizasaurus is a nickname for fossils found in New Mexico from a long, long time ago during a period called the Late Triassic. People first thought they were bones from a meat-eating dinosaur. There's a special find called NMMNH P-18400, which includes a shin bone, backbone pieces, and some smaller bits. These fossils came from an area called Bluewater Creek, close to Fort Wingate. Andrew Heckert suggested a name for them, but it didn't stick. The fossils were officially talked about in a science paper in 2007 when people studied similar fossils from North America that might have belonged to big, lizard-like animals called Archosauriformes. \nSphaerotholus is a type of dinosaur called a pachycephalosaurid, found in the western United States and Canada during the Upper Cretaceous period. There are three known species: S. goodwini from New Mexico, S. buchholtzae from Montana, and S. edmontonense from Alberta. The name comes from Greek words for ball and dome because of their dome-shaped skull. These dinosaurs lived for about 7-8 million years and were widespread. Sphaerotholus is unique because it has a special bone feature that sets it apart from other pachycephalosaurids. It's considered a highly evolved species within its group. \nOryctodromeus was a tiny dinosaur that belonged to the Thescelosauridae family, which were known for running fast and eating plants. It was the first dinosaur discovered that had the ability to dig, as shown by its fossils found in Montana and Idaho around 95 million years ago during the Cenomanian stage of the Cretaceous period. \nCryptoraptor, a name derived from secret thief, refers to ancient bones found in New Mexico from the Late Triassic period. Initially, people thought they were dinosaur fossils. The bones, discovered in the Bull Canyon Formation during the Norian age of the Upper Triassic, include parts of the spine, pelvis, and thigh bones. Adrian Hunt suggested calling it Cryptoraptor lockleyi in his research, but this name didn't gain acceptance. The bones were first mentioned scientifically in 2007 when researchers re-examined Late Triassic North American fossils thought to be from dinosaurs, but they could only classify them as part of the group called Archosauria. \nThe fossil Comanchesaurus, found in New Mexico from the Late Triassic period, was initially thought to be a type of dinosaur. It includes bones from the spine and legs. A scientist named Adrian Hunt suggested calling it Comanchesaurus kuesi, but that name didn't catch on. In 2007, researchers studying Late Triassic dinosaur remains in North America, which included the Comanchesaurus, decided it might belong to a group of reptiles called saurischians, but they weren't sure. \nMark Ciardi is an American who used to play baseball professionally but now works as a film producer. He's the boss of Apex Entertainment, a company that makes movies and helps finance them. Before Apex, he co-founded Mayhem Pictures, where he made famous films like The Rookie, Miracle, Invincible, and Secretariat, among others. He also produced a documentary called Big Shot that won an Emmy. Currently, they're working on a book called Fallen that has sold a lot around the world. \nFruitadens is a tiny dinosaur called a heterodontosaurid. It got its name from where scientists first found its fossils, in Fruita, Colorado. They found parts of its skull and body from four different individuals of different ages in rocks from a long time ago, called the Late Jurassic. Fruitadens is the tiniest known dinosaur that belongs to the group called ornithischians. It was about as long as a ruler (65 to 70 inches) and weighed around as much as a big cat (0.5 to 1 pound). Scientists think it ate both plants and animals, and it was one of the last of its kind to live. \nDakotadon is a type of dinosaur that lived a long time ago during the Cretaceous period, around 130 million years ago. It was found in South Dakota, USA, in a rock layer called the Lakota Formation. The dinosaur was first discovered and named Iguanodon lakotaensis in 1989 by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork. However, scientists have had disagreements about where it fits in the family tree of dinosaurs. Some think it's more closely related to Iguanodon bernissartensis and Theiophytalia, while others believe it's the same as I. bernissartensis. In 2008, Gregory S. Paul decided to give this dinosaur its own genus, which he called Dakotadon."}], "output": "\nDinosaur.**"},

Donald Trump, a businessman, and Mike Pence, a governor from Indiana, won against Hillary Clinton, a former first lady, senator, and secretary of state, and Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia. Trump became the 45th president and Pence became the 48th vice president on January 20, 2017. At the same time, people also voted for other leaders like senators, representatives, and local officials. \nOn March 8, 2016, there was a special election in Michigan, a state in the United States, for the Democratic Party to choose their candidates for the big 2016 presidential election.\nIn the 1976 presidential election, Jimmy Carter, a former Georgia governor, surprised everyone by winning against Gerald Ford, who was the sitting president. Carter's running mate was Walter Mondale, a senator from Minnesota, while Ford's running mate was Bob Dole, a senator from Kansas.

The party leaders then choose the official nominee for their party. \nRichard Nixon, a former Vice President, won the 1968 US presidential election against Hubert Humphrey, who was running for a second term. This election is considered significant because it marked a big change in the political landscape, as it ended the long-lasting influence of the New Deal Coalition that had been in control for 36 years. \nIn 1960, there was a big election in the United States to choose a new president. Richard Nixon, who was vice president, was the chosen candidate from the Republican Party. John F. Kennedy, a senator from Massachusetts, was picked by the Democratic Party. Since President Dwight D. Eisenhower couldn't run for a third term because of a new rule called the Twenty-second Amendment, he didn't run. This election was special because people living in Alaska and Hawaii, who became states recently in 1959, could now vote for the first time. \nIn the 1964 US presidential election, President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had taken over after John F. Kennedy's death, easily won. He got 61.1% of the votes, which was the highest since James Monroe in 1820. It was the biggest popular vote margin ever and the 10th biggest in electoral votes. No one has come close to Johnson's vote percentage since, and only a few other presidents, like Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan, have won with a bigger electoral vote difference. \nThe 1892 US presidential election was a rematch of the previous election in 1888. Both Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, and Benjamin Harrison, a Republican, were running for another term. In 1888, Cleveland won the popular vote but lost the electoral college, but in 1892, he won both the popular and electoral vote, making history as the only person to be elected to a non-consecutive second term. A new party called the Populist Party, supported by farmers' groups, did well in the West, winning five states and 22 electoral votes."}], "output": "\n2020.**"},

They were Celts, and we know about them because we found some inscriptions that date back to the 4th century.\nThe culture that developed in Britain after the Romans conquered in 43 AD and named it Britannia was called Romano-British. It mixed Roman and local Celtic influences. Even after the Romans left in the 5th century, this culture continued. Some experts think that in the 5th and 6th centuries, when the Anglo-Saxons were attacking, southern Britain still had a lively sub-Roman culture, which even used a Latin-based language in their writing until St Augustine arrived in 597 AD. \nWales has a long human history, with Neanderthals and Homo sapiens living there over 230,000 and 31,000 years ago, respectively. Modern humans settled after the last ice age around 9,000 BC. The region was mainly inhabited by Celtic Britons and spoke the Brittonic language during the Iron Age. Romans conquered Wales in AD 43 and left in the 5th century, which led to the Anglo-Saxon invasion. Over time, the Brittonic language divided into different groups, with the Welsh being the largest and separate from others after the 11th century. \nThe Durotriges were a Celtic group living in Britain before the Romans came. They mostly lived in areas like Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset, and Devon, near the River Axe. They also lived on the western side of the Isle of Wight. After the Romans won, their main places were called Durnovaria (now Dorchester) and Lindinis (now Ilchester). The Durotriges were surrounded by other tribes, like the Dumnonii to the west and the Belgae to the east. \nThe Corieltauvi were a group of people who lived in England before the Romans arrived. They had their own area, which is now the East Midlands. They were surrounded by other tribes like the Brigantes to the north, Cornovii to the west, Dobunni and Catuvellauni to the south, and the Iceni to the east. Their main city, called Ratae Corieltauvorum, is now known as Leicester. \nIn the year 43 AD, which was a regular year starting on a Tuesday, people used the Julian calendar. It was also called the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Vitellius, or sometimes the 796th year since the city was founded. The name AD 43 became popular during the Middle Ages when the Anno Domini calendar became the main way to count years in Europe. \nThe Romans slowly conquered Britain starting around AD 43 when Emperor Claudius was in power. His general, Aulus Plautius, became the first ruler of Roman Britain. Britain had been invaded by the Romans many times before, even before the official conquest. For about a hundred years after Julius Caesar visited in 55 and 54 BC, Britain had friendly relations with Rome, trading and influenced by their culture and economy. This Roman influence was noticeable especially in the southern part of the country during the late Iron Age before the official Roman rule. \nThe Sussex chicken is a type of chicken that was brought to England during the Roman invasion in 43 AD. It's a popular choice for people to keep in their gardens and comes in eight colors, with more colors being developed. There's also a smaller version called bantams, which are 1/4 the size of regular Sussex chickens and can be any of the eight colors too. \nEngland has been inhabited for over 800,000 years, with evidence of early humans found in Norfolk and a jawbone in Devon dating back 41,000 to 44,000 years. Continuous human settlement started around 13,000 years ago after the last ice age. The region has significant historical sites from various periods like Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Age. The Celts, including Belgic tribes like the Atrebates and Catuvellauni, inhabited England during the Iron Age. The Romans conquered England in AD 43 and ruled until the early 5th century."}], "output": "\nRoman.**"},

Some Frisian settlers in Southern Jutland also spoke it, but there are no known texts from that area. The language of the original inhabitants in the region around the Zuiderzee and Ems River, as mentioned by Tacitus, is only found in a few personal names and place names. Over time, Old Frisian developed into Middle Frisian, spoken from the 16th to the 19th century. \nThe Leda is a river in northwest Germany, specifically in Lower Saxony. It flows into the Ems and starts from where the Sagter Ems and Soeste rivers meet near Barßel. The river passes through Leer before ending.

There's a castle called Hatton Castle located near the top of Hatton Hill, overlooking the village of Newtyle. \nHatton Castle is located on Hatton Hill, the easternmost of the Sidlaw Hills, near Newtyle in Angus, Scotland. It sits high enough to see a dense forest called the Den of Newtyle. From there, you can enjoy stunning views of Strathmore, including famous mountains like Ben Lawers and Schiehallion, as well as the Angus and Glenshee hills. This castle was built in the 16th century in a common Scottish design for a fortified home, called a Z plan tower house. Before Hatton Castle, there was another castle called Balcraig Castle, which was about a short distance away on Hatton Hill.\nAngus cattle usually have no horns and can be black or red, with a white udder. Originally, they were all black, but red ones have appeared too. In the United States, they are seen as two different types: Red Angus and Black Angus.

People say Sir William Wallace, a famous warrior, stayed there, and one tower was named after him. King Edward I of England also visited and spent a night there in 1303. Later, a man named James Erskine, who was the 7th Earl of Buchan, probably built a tower in the 1600s. \nThe Hatton Baronetcy was a special title given in England.

He wrote it in 1967 when he was in the Beatles. The song came after Paul McCartney said he took LSD, which caused a big fuss in the media. It's like when John Lennon said the Beatles were more important than religion. See Yourself talks about being self-aware and thinking about how your actions affect others. It has a unique music style with different time signatures, like 4/4 and 9/8. The lyrics also remember the ideas from Beatles songs like Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love from that time. \nWithin You Without You is a song by George Harrison from the Beatles' 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It's about his time in India learning from his teacher Ravi Shankar in 1966. The song has Indian instruments like the sitar, dilruba, and tabla. It's different from the Beatles' earlier music, as it sounds like Indian devotional music and has spiritual lyrics influenced by Hindu beliefs. Harrison's love for Indian culture is also shown on the album cover with pictures of yogis like Paramahansa Yogananda.\nLove Songs: A Compilation... Old and New is a collection of music by Phil Collins, an English singer. This album came out on September 28, 2004, from Atlantic Recording Corporation and Rhino Entertainment.

She co-founded Jivamukti Yoga with David Life, which became popular in the western world during the late 20th century. This yoga method focuses on finding enlightenment by showing love and care for all living beings, including animals and nature, and challenges the idea of exploiting them.\n\nJivamukti Yoga teaches that to reach happiness, one must be kind to all without exception. One of its key practices is a vegan diet, as it causes minimal harm to the environment and others, including humans. The concept of shunyata or emptiness, from ancient yogic texts, is central to the practice. It suggests that our perception shapes our reality, so to change the world, we must first change our own views and stop blaming others.\n\nGannon believes that our actions towards others determine how we are treated, which in turn influences how we see ourselves, shaping our identity. \nSyd Barrett, a founding member of Pink Floyd and a key contributor to their early success, wrote many songs for their first two albums, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets. However, his mental health declined and he was removed from the band in 1968, replaced by David Gilmour. Barrett then released two solo albums in 1970 but eventually left the music industry in 1972. \nAfter David Bowie's death, an album called No Plan was released on January 8, 2017. This was to celebrate what would have been Bowie's 70th birthday. The album contains songs he wrote for a Broadway show called Lazarus, like the title song Lazarus and others. The songs were first heard in the show's soundtrack. The recordings on No Plan were actually from Bowie's last studio album, Blackstar. The album reached #138 on the Billboard charts. There's also a music video for the title song, directed by Tom Hingston. \nBilly Bragg, an English musician, released a three-song single called We Laughed as part of the Rosetta Life project in 2005 in the UK. The single became quite popular, reaching No. 11 on the charts. In 2006, it also made it to No. 38 in Ireland. What's unique about this single is that Bragg worked with three patients from Trimar Hospice in Weymouth. They shared their experiences with illness and emotions by writing the lyrics for the songs. English guitarist Robbie McIntosh helped produce the tracks. \nWho Can See It is a song by George Harrison, from his 1973 album Living in the Material World. The song talks about how Harrison felt after the Beatles broke up in 1970. He was trying to be his own person and not live up to the huge expectations people had because of the band's fame. Some people think he wrote it when he was feeling sad after getting a lot of praise for his solo work and helping with a charity project in Bangladesh. The song is similar to another one John Lennon did in 1970, which was also about facing his own emotions. \nCharlotte Gainsbourg, a French musician and actress, released her second album, 5:55, after a 20-year break. She worked with popular artists like French duo Air, Jarvis Cocker, Neil Hannon, and Radiohead's producer Nigel Godrich. Two songs, Songs That We Sing and 5:55, were released as singles. The album was a big hit in France, selling over half a million copies and earning a platinum certification. However, in the US, it sold only 22,000 copies. Songs That We Sing was highly regarded, ranking 78th on Rolling Stone's list of the best songs of 2007. \nColin Murray Gem Archer is an English musician who was part of popular bands like Oasis, Beady Eye, and Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds. He joined Oasis in 1999 and played rhythm guitar, sometimes taking on lead guitar for acoustic songs too. He helped write some songs for the band. After Oasis ended in 2009, he worked with Liam Gallagher to create Beady Eye, which released two albums before disbanding in 2014. In 2017, he joined Noel Gallagher's new band, High Flying Birds, reuniting with another former Oasis bandmate."}], "output": "\nGeorge Harrison.**"},

He was there for 10 years and admitted to killing a U.S. soldier. He said he lied about the guilty plea to go back home to Canada. Khadr sued the Canadian government for violating his rights, and they settled in 2017 by paying him $10.5 million and apologizing. \nSon of al Qaeda is a documentary about Abdurahman Khadr, a Canadian whose dad had connections to Osama bin Laden.

This is not clearly stated in the policy. Surprisingly, most policies don't promise to settle. In California, if an insurance company refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy's limits and the insured ends up losing more than the policy's amount, the insurance company is responsible for the full judgment. This is because when a settlement offer is higher than the policy limit but still within the limits, the insurance company and the policyholder have different interests. The insurance company should decide if the offer is reasonable, not if their policy covers it. They must also keep the policyholder informed about settlement offers. If the insurance company forces the policyholder to contribute to a settlement unfairly, they can be held liable. \nMana Al Otaiba, born on May 15, 1946, in Abu Dhabi, UAE, to Saeed Al Otaiba, had a career as the former Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources under Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.

It started as a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on October 25th, but actually formed from storms in the Sulu Sea four days earlier. It got stronger and stronger, turning into a cyclonic storm the next day and then becoming a super cyclonic storm with winds of 260 km/h and very low pressure on October 28th. This powerful storm hit Odisha on October 29th and caused a lot of damage. However, it slowly weakened when it hit land and stayed near the coast for two days. Eventually, it weakened even more and dissipated over the Bay of Bengal on November 1st. \nKathantara is a 2007 Indian Oriya film that tells the story of the hardships faced during the 1999 Odisha cyclone, directed by Himansu Khatua.\nIn May 2017, Severe Tropical Cyclone Donna became the strongest cyclone to form outside the usual season in the South Pacific. It started as a disturbance northwest of Fiji, then became Tropical Depression 21F. As it moved east, conditions improved, and it turned into Tropical Cyclone Donna and reached Category 1. It intensified to Category 4 and then Category 5 before weakening due to wind shear and upwelling. The storm then weakened further and moved south, becoming a tropical low before dissipating completely by May 16th. \nIn 1988, a powerful storm called Severe Tropical Cyclone Anne formed in the South Pacific. It started as a weak depression near Tuvalu and then grew stronger as it moved southwest. On January 8, it became a named storm called Anne. Just one day later, it rapidly intensified and became the strongest storm to hit Vanuatu in four years. Anne reached its strongest point on January 11, matching the intensity of a Category 5 hurricane and a Category 4 cyclone. It then moved south and hit New Caledonia, making it the strongest storm ever to affect that area. After interacting with another storm called Tropical Cyclone Agi, Anne weakened and became a depression. Its last known location was southeast of New Caledonia on January 14. \nIn the 2007-08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season, Tropical Cyclone Hondo was the strongest and longest-lasting storm. It started as a tropical disturbance in early February, east-southeast of Diego Garcia. It quickly became a moderate storm, then a severe one, and reached its peak intensity with winds of 130 mph on February 7th. However, it weakened over the next few days due to faster speed and cooler waters. Hondo disappeared on February 12th but regained strength and was named Ex-Hondo, becoming a tropical depression. It passed over Réunion, causing it to weaken again. The storm dissipated on February 29th after looping counterclockwise. \nThe 2002-2003 Australian cyclone season had a very strong cyclone called Inigo, which was as powerful as Cyclone Gwenda from 1999. This season started on November 1, 2002, and ended on April 30, 2003. The tropical cyclone season is different from the tropical cyclone year, which goes from July 1 to June 30. The 'Australian region' for cyclones is in the southern hemisphere between 90°E and 180°E. During this time, 10 tropical depressions formed, with the first one called Tropical Cyclone 07S coming in on December 27, 2002, and the last one, Cyclone Epi, disappearing on June 6, 2003. Four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres, run by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) in Perth, Darwin, Brisbane, and Port Moresby, monitored these storms. \nCyclone Gonu, also known as Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu, was the most powerful tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Arabian Sea and the strongest named storm in the northern Indian Ocean in 2007. It started as a cluster of clouds in the eastern Arabian Sea on June 1 and rapidly gained strength due to favorable conditions and warm water. By June 4, it reached its peak with winds blowing at 235 km/h (145 mph). However, as it met dry air and cooler water, its intensity decreased. On June 6, Cyclone Gonu made landfall in Oman, marking the strongest storm to hit the Arabian Peninsula. It then moved north into the Gulf of Oman and dissipated after making landfall in southern Iran, which hadn't seen a landfall of this intensity since 1898. \nIn May 2002, Tropical Cyclone Kesiny, a weak hurricane, made landfall in the south-west Indian Ocean for the first time in May. This storm formed from a weather system near the equator, linked to an increase in the Madden-Julian oscillation, which also caused storms in other parts of the Indian Ocean. Initially, Kesiny moved southeast but changed direction due to a stronger weather ridge. It intensified into a cyclone on May 6 but weakened later. Surprisingly, it regained strength with an eye and hit Madagascar near Antsiranana on May 9 with winds of 130 km/h. The storm weakened as it passed through the country and then struck again before finally dissipating on May 11. \nIn February and March 1992, a powerful tropical cyclone named Esau became the strongest to hit New Caledonia. It started as a weak depression in the monsoon trough northeast of Port Vila, Vanuatu. The system strengthened as it moved southwest, passing over Pentecost Island and Malampa. It was later named Esau and reached Category 4 intensity. The cyclone then threatened both Southern Vanuatu and New Caledonia, making landfall as a Category 3 storm. After hitting New Caledonia, it weakened to an extratropical cyclone and eventually dissipated over New Zealand's North Island and the South Pacific Ocean. \nThe 2011-12 South Pacific cyclone season was very quiet, with only three cyclones. It took place from November 1, 2011, to April 30, 2012. If a cyclone formed after June 30, 2012, it would have counted for the previous year. The strongest cyclone, Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine, came from outside the South Pacific. In the basin, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Fiji (RSMC Nadi) and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in New Zealand (TCWC Wellington) monitor cyclones. RSMC Nadi labels disturbances with an F, and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) gives warnings, calling them tropical storms or stronger, with a number and P. Both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington use the Australian scale to measure wind speed over ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over one minute using the Saffir-Simpson scale."}], "output": "\nCyclone Gonu.**"},

He is well-known for his approximately 300 math papers, where he significantly contributed to the fields of set theory and topology. \nSemyon Gershgorin was a Soviet mathematician born in Pruzhany, Russian Empire. He started his academic journey at the Petrograd Technological Institute in 1923 and later became a professor in 1930. That same year, he joined the Leningrad Mechanical Engineering Institute. Notably, he is known for the Gershgorin circle theorem, which is one of his significant contributions.\nThe nerve of an open covering in topology helps to simplify and show important details about a topological space X using a special kind of diagram called an abstract simplicial complex. This idea was first introduced by Pavel Alexandrov and has since been expanded to other versions like the Čech nerve and hypercoverings, which make complex topological information more manageable. \nPavel Urysohn, a Jewish mathematician from the Soviet Union, was born on February 3, 1898, and passed away on August 17, 1924. He made significant contributions to the field of dimension theory and is known for creating two important theorems in topology: Urysohn's Metrization Theorem and Urysohn's Lemma. These theorems are fundamental to understanding topology. Urysohn's name is also associated with several other mathematical concepts, such as Urysohn universal space, Fréchet–Urysohn space, Menger–Urysohn dimension, and the Urysohn integral equation. In 1923, Urysohn, along with Pavel Alexandrov, introduced the modern definition of compactness. \nThe Alexandroff extension is a simple concept in topology that helps make noncompact spaces compact. It adds one extra point to the original space, making it easier to work with and ensuring it's now compact. It's named after mathematician Pavel Alexandrov. \nSemyon Aranovich was a movie director from Ukraine, born in 1934. He worked both in the Soviet Union and Russia. Sadly, he passed away in Hamburg, Germany, in 1996. \nThe Soviet drama television film Rafferty, directed by Semyon Aranovich in 1980, is an adaptation of Lionel White's American novel. \nThe 1985 Soviet TV series Confrontation or Противостояние is a six-part film directed by Semyon Aranovich, adapted from Yulian Semyonov's novel. \nIn 1994, a Russian drama movie called The Year of the Dog (directed by Semyon Aranovich) was made. This film was so special that it won a Silver Bear award at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival because of its amazing artistic qualities. \nThe Gershgorin circle theorem is a math tool that helps us understand the values in a square matrix. A man named Semyon Aronovich Gershgorin from Russia came up with it in 1931.

He was a beloved captain by the sailors because he had a more laid-back approach on the ship, which motivated them.\nDuring the Vietnam War in 1965, Operation Market Time was a cooperative effort by the United States Navy and South Vietnam to prevent the flow of troops, weapons, and supplies from North Vietnam into southern areas via sea, land, and rivers. The United States Coast Guard, specifically Squadron One and Squadron Three, actively participated. They used powerful boats, including 82 ft patrol boats armed with five cannons, to provide support in combat situations. \nThe USS Trippe is a Knox-class frigate that the US Navy built in Louisiana. It was commissioned in September 1970 and later underwent a major upgrade at the Boston Naval Shipyard in 1971. This upgrade included the Basic Point Defense Missile System, which featured Sea Sparrow missiles for defense against air and missile attacks. Trippe was the first destroyer-type ship to have this system installed. After testing her new weapons, the ship participated in exercises and provided support during the Vietnam War in 1972. It then traveled through the Panama Canal to Southeast Asia, visiting various ports in a region that would see increased Navy activity later. In December 1972, Trippe completed a global deployment, returning to the East Coast of the United States. \nThe United States is having a discussion among its Navy, Marine Corps, government, and some independent groups about how the Navy should support ground troops with naval artillery in the 21st century. The main focus is on deciding the importance of this role and finding the best way to carry it out. \nNaval gunfire support, or shore bombardment, is when Navy uses big guns to help soldiers on land during an attack. This is part of the bigger job called Naval Fires. Nowadays, NGFS is important along with planes and missiles to help in battles where soldiers go on the shore from boats. Using ship's guns against land places has been done for a very long time in wars at sea. \nDuring the Vietnam War, the United States Seventh Fleet, which had a playful nickname called Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club, carried out various combat missions. These missions included attacking with carrier air strikes, providing naval gunfire support, conducting amphibious operations, surveillance, and mine-clearing activities. \nIn the 1890s, Italy's Royal Navy started building battleships that were smaller, faster, and had thinner armor compared to other countries' ships. They started with the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class, which had a limited budget. Admiral Simone de Pacoret Saint Bon ordered two ships, but his friend Benedetto Brin influenced the design later. Brin's Regina Margherita class was bigger and aimed to compete with the Habsburg-class battleships from Austria-Hungary. Unfortunately, Brin passed away during construction. Vittorio Cuniberti then created the Regina Elena class, the fastest battleships at that time, used mainly for supporting Italian troops in the 1911-12 Italo-Turkish War, as the Ottoman Navy stayed in ports. \nKirov was a Russian warship that fought in many battles, including the Winter War, World War II, and the Cold War. It tried to attack Finnish guns but got hurt. It helped save Tallinn in 1941 and then stayed in Leningrad, protecting the city during a long siege. Later, it participated in a battle in 1944 but didn't fight anymore. In 1961, it was changed to a training ship and eventually scrapped in 1974. \nJean Bart was a battleship built for the French Navy as part of their 1910 plan. Before World War I, she joined the Mediterranean fleet and played a role in sinking the Zenta on August 16, 1914. She provided support to the Montenegrin Army until a submarine, U-12, torpedoed her on December 21. Even with three damaged areas, she managed to reach Malta for repairs that took almost four months. After fixing her, she participated in the Otranto Barrage in the Adriatic for the rest of the war."}], "output": "\nRear Admiral J. Edward Snyder.**"},

Because white insurance companies often didn't give life insurance to black people, this company was very important in helping the African-American community in Chicago. It became a big success and represented the economic growth of the mostly black Bronzeville neighborhood from the 1920s to the 1950s. \nThe New York Life Insurance Building in Montreal, also called the Quebec Bank Building, is an office building located in Old Montreal near Place d'Armes. It was built between 1887 and 1889 and was the tallest commercial building in the city back then.

It's named after a religious leader named Tenskwatawa, who was Tecumseh's brother. The park is special because it was made in 2004 and has a museum. Inside the museum, you can see a pretend Native American village and a farm from the 1920s. It's about a mile away from where an important battle, the Battle of Tippecanoe, happened. \nThe Battle of Fallen Timbers, which happened on August 20, 1794, marked the end of the Northwest Indian War. This war was about Native American tribes, including support from the British, trying to keep control of land in the Northwest Territory. The United States wanted this land because they thought they owned it after a peace agreement in 1783. But the Native Americans didn't agree and had help from the British. The Americans attacked, and after the battle, the British and their Native allies left. This victory stopped big fights in the area until later conflicts like Tecumseh's War and the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. \nẒafār, also known as Dhafar, is an ancient Himyarite site located in Yemen, about 130 kilometers southeast of the current capital, Sana'a. This place has been mentioned in old texts and its name pronunciation is well-established. Although some people in Oman believe otherwise, Zafar in Yemen is older than a similarly named site in Oman. It is situated high in the Yemenite mountains at an altitude of around 2800 meters. The nearest significant town is Yarim, which is about 10 kilometers northwest. Zafar was the capital of the Himyarites, a powerful confederation that ruled much of Arabia from 110 BCE to 525 CE. Before the Aksumite conquest, Zafar served as the Himyarite capital in southern Arabia, stretching its territory from Riyadh to the north and the Euphrates to the northeast for 250 years."}], "output": "\n19th century.**"},

It began when Peter Aylen, a significant Irish timber operator, formed a group called the Shiners. Their purpose was to attack other timber businesses, specifically those belonging to French Canadians. They even physically clashed with French Canadians on the streets of Bytown. \nFrench Canadians, also known as Franco-Canadians or Canadiens, are a group of people in Canada who have ancestors from French settlers who started living there in the 1600s. These people mainly speak French and make up about 22% of the total population in the country.\nThe Oku people are an ethnic group from Sierra Leone and the Gambia. They come from Nigeria and have Yoruba roots. Most Oku people are Muslims and are known for their strict adherence to their faith. A long time ago, the British government recognized them as a separate community in Sierra Leone. Some people in Sierra Leone think of them as a unique ethnic group, not just part of the larger Creole group. \nThe Ancient Order of Hibernians is a special group for Irish Catholic people. They need to be Catholic and either born in Ireland or have Irish roots. This group was started in New York City in 1836 by Irish immigrants. They formed to protect Catholic churches from people who didn't like Catholics and to help Irish Catholic people, especially those who faced problems like discrimination or tough working conditions in coal mines. In Pennsylvania, many members had connections with the Molly Maguires. This group became very important for Irish American politics. \nThe Pinpu tribe, also known as the Pepo or Plains tribes, lived in the west of Taiwan and had a simple farming life before many Han people moved in. Starting in the 1600s, they faced challenges from outside forces like the Dutch, Spanish, and Han Chinese. These challenges led to them losing their own language and culture, and by the late 1800s, they mostly assimilated with the Han Chinese. Now, they are a nearly invisible group in a society mainly controlled by the Han Chinese. During Japan's rule, Japanese scholars studied these tribes using science, and their research helped shape how we categorize the Plains tribes today. \nAfrican Bermudians, or those with African roots, are a group of people in Bermuda. Their ancestors were Black Africans who were brought there as slaves. Some free Black people also came to Bermuda as workers during the 17th century. By the 19th century, Black people became the most numerous group, surpassing the White population. Initially, they were grouped together as Coloured with other non-white people. In the 20th century, Black Bermudians became a recognized ethnic group and remained the largest in the island. \nPhiladelphia is home to a large number of people with Irish ancestry, who have lived there since before the American Revolution. Irishmen played a role in supporting the revolution. As Philadelphia's population changed with the arrival of many Europeans in the 1800s, the Irish, fleeing the Irish Famine, were a significant part of this. Despite the city's Quaker roots, which promoted religious tolerance, tensions arose between the Irish and other groups, leading to riots. However, the Irish eventually found work in the city's growing industrial sector and gained social and financial standing by the end of the 1800s, contributing to the establishment of important institutions. \nThe Americo-Liberians are a group of people in Liberia with a mix of African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and freed African ancestry. They are related to the Sierra Leone Creole people. These people came from Africa, mostly former slaves and free African Americans, to start Liberia in the 1800s. They called themselves Americo-Liberians. Today, the terms Americo-Liberian and Congo are used interchangeably to describe this group of people who are descendants of those who settled in Liberia, including free and ex-slave Africans, Caribbean people, and Sierra Leone Creoles who arrived between 1822. \nBoston, Massachusetts has a large group of people with Irish roots. In the past, it was mainly an area for Puritans, but during the 19th century, many Europeans, especially Irish immigrants, started coming. The Irish were the main group during this time, especially after the Great Irish Famine. This change made Boston more diverse. The Irish worked for the Yankees but didn't mix much. There was some negative feeling towards Irish Catholics in the 1840s and 50s, but during the Civil War, many Irish fought for the Union and that showed their love for their new country, which helped to reduce some of the prejudice. \nVolhynian Czechs, or ethnic Czechs living in Ukraine, mostly settled in the Volhynia region around 1868-1880 due to tough conditions in their homeland and the promise of better opportunities in Russia. The Russian government offered incentives like cheap land, business support, education, self-rule, and religious freedom. These immigrants, mostly in areas like Volhynia, Zhytomyr, and Lutsk, formed new villages named with a Czech suffix, like České Noviny. They diversified into agriculture, industry, trade, and crafts, with many focusing on engineering, brewing, and other businesses. They established schools, churches, and libraries, enriching the cultural and social life of their communities. Their contributions significantly improved the economy and cultural scene in those areas."}], "output": "\nFrench Canadians.**"},

The concerto was dedicated to Christabel McLaren, Lady Aberconway. Initially, Tertis rejected it, but Paul Hindemith performed it and it received a warm reception. This success put Walton in the spotlight in British classical music. Noted critic Eric Blom praised Walton's talent, even suggesting the concerto might be the best composition in recent times, regardless of nationality. Tertis later changed his mind and started performing the work himself. \nHans Christian Andersen, a Danish poet and author, wrote a fairy tale called The Most Incredible Thing.

These cities are close to each other because they are connected by the Øresund Bridge, which goes over a waterway called the Øresund strait. There's also a ferry called HH Ferry that helps people travel between Elsinore, Denmark, and Helsingborg, Sweden, when the water is too wide for the bridge. \nThe Øresund Bridge is a special road and train bridge that connects Sweden and Denmark. It goes for about 8 kilometers from the Swedish side to a man-made island called Peberholm. After that, there's a 4 kilometer tunnel called the Drogden Tunnel that takes you from Peberholm to the Danish island of Amager.\nThe Bjarkøy Fixed Link is a plan to build a connection between three islands in Harstad, Troms county, Norway. A tunnel will go underwater between Bjarkøya and Grytøya, while a bridge will link Grytøya and Sandsøya. The tunnel will be 3.25 km long and the bridge will have a 300-meter section plus a 900-meter causeway. There will also be 3 km of new road on Grytøya to meet the new tunnel.

It's not very crowded, with only 22 people per square kilometer. \nThe E47 highway connects Lübeck in Germany, Copenhagen in Denmark, and Helsingborg in Sweden. It mostly has motorway standards, but there are exceptions like a 28 km stretch in Germany (mainly in the city of Helsingør) and two ferry crossings. Currently, there's a ferry between Germany and Denmark, but they plan to build a fixed link by 2020 due to safety and environmental concerns. The Danish parliament chose a tunnel over a bridge across the Fehmarn Strait. There's also a ferry between Helsingør in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden, although a bridge-tunnel already exists further south. The ferry between these two cities still has a busy schedule. \nThe City Tunnel in Malmö, Sweden, is a 17-kilometer train route that connects Malmö Central Station and the Öresund Line, which goes over the Öresund Bridge. About six kilometers of this tunnel is located beneath the city. Its purpose is to increase train capacity by turning Malmö Central Station into a station where trains can pass through, not end. This project cost 9.45 billion SEK and construction started in March 2005. King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden opened it on December 4, 2010, and regular service began on December 12, 2010. \nThe Öresund Committee was a group that worked together to promote political cooperation in the area around Öresund.

In summer, it produces white flowers in clusters from reddish buds near the leaf bases. The fruit, which looks like an almond, is about 2 inches long and ranges in color from magenta to reddish brown. It's not edible raw due to its bitterness, but historically, people used to boil, roast, and grind it to make a coffee-like drink.\nSinocyclocheilus is a group of freshwater fish from China, living only in Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan.

This one is small and has really long legs, which means it could walk upright. It also had different kinds of teeth, which might mean it ate both plants and animals. Its thin legs and how they were positioned show that it spent most of its time on land, not in the water like modern crocodiles and alligators. So, Araripesuchus wegeneri is quite different from its modern-day cousins. \nThe Marsileaceae is a small family of unique aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns that don't look like regular ferns. They're also known as the pepperwort or water-clover family because the leaves of the Marsilea genus somewhat resemble a four-leaf clover, which is a flowering plant. People sometimes use Marsilea leaves as a substitute for clover leaves on Saint Patrick's Day. This family has about 3 genera and 50 to 80 species, with most of them in the Marsilea group. \nThe Be'er Sheva fringe-fingered lizard is a special kind of lizard that belongs to the Lacertidae family. It has a group called Acanthodactylus, which are lizards with spiny feet. It's different from other lizards because of how it looks and where it lives, even though it shares some DNA with another lizard called Acanthodactylus pardalis. This lizard lays eggs, usually 3 to 7 at a time, and the grown-ups can be 17 to 20 centimeters long, sometimes bigger. It lives only in a special area called the Negev desert in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, where there's a lot of different plant and animal life. \nFen is a type of wetland, like marshes and swamps, but with unique properties. It's a special kind of peatland that gets its nutrients from mineral-rich water. The water in fens is usually neutral or alkaline, high in minerals but not many other plant food. These places are mostly covered by grasses and sedges, and sometimes have mosses and carnivorous plants like Pinguicula. Fens can also be found near big lakes and rivers where water levels change, keeping the ground moist without many trees. The types of plants you'll find in a fen depend on how much water and what nutrients are available. \nDwarf waterclover, also known as Marsilea minuta, is a tiny aquatic fern from the Marsileaceae family. It's important not to mix it with Marsilea vestita, as they share a similar name. Other friendly names for this plant are gelid waterklawer, small water clover, airy pepperwort, and pepperwort. However, the name pepperwort can also refer to plants from the Lepidium genus. In French, it has a special name that is different."}], "output": "\nMarsilea.**"},

This position is similar to the Lord President of the Council in the UK. \nThe Great Hall of the People is a special building in Beijing, near Tiananmen Square. It's where the leaders of China, like the government and the Communist Party, have important meetings and events. They use it for big decisions and gatherings, like when the big meetings of the parliament happen every March with the political advisory group.

It was built in the 17th-century Scottish Baronial style by Henry Edward Clifford and opened in 1890 by Sir John Stirling Maxwell. Initially, it served as a Masonic meeting place and a community center for the small burgh of Pollokshields. However, as the city expanded, the area was absorbed by Glasgow in 1891. Today, the hall still functions as a Masonic venue, which is evident from the masonic symbols found in the carvings and stained-glass windows, particularly at the back of the building. \nThe historic Blackman-Bosworth Store, also called Bosworth Store Building, S.N. Bosworth's Cheap Cash Store, David Blackman's Store, and Randolph County Museum, is located in Beverly, West Virginia. It's a two-story brick building with a stone base, originally built around 1828 and expanded in 1894.

However, because he insisted on keeping 51% ownership and believed the technology was worth a lot of money, it didn't become very successful in the market. \nStarlite is a special material that can protect against very high heat. A man named Maurice Ward, who wasn't a scientist but worked as a hairdresser, created it in the 1970s and 1980s.

Boren or United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.? \n\n Passage: \nThe Paramount Pictures case in 1948, also called the Hollywood Antitrust Case, was a big court ruling that said movie studios couldn't own theaters and force them to only show their films. This decision affected how movies were made, distributed, and shown in theaters. The court said this kind of exclusive deal was against the antitrust laws in the US. \nIn the 1976 case of Craig v. Boren, the Supreme Court ruled for the first time that when a government makes rules based on gender, those rules have to meet a certain level of scrutiny to make sure they're fair under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that sex-based classifications in laws or policies need to be carefully examined to ensure they don't discriminate unfairly.\nBlock booking is a way movie studios sell several films to a theater as a package. This was common in Hollywood during the 1930s until it was banned in 1948. With block booking, theater owners had to buy a lot of movies from a studio without knowing what they were. Studios would include both popular movies with famous actors and less popular ones. This helped studios save money on making and showing movies, and the part where owners bid on unseen movies is called blind bidding. \nIn 1971, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a law saying marriage can only be between a man and a woman was constitutional. Richard Baker, who didn't agree, tried to appeal to the US Supreme Court. But on October 10, 1972, they didn't want to hear the case because there wasn't a big enough issue. This decision, Baker v. Nelson, became a legal precedent. In 2013, Minnesota allowed same-sex marriage, and in 2015, the US Supreme Court said Baker's case was wrong in a new ruling called Obergefell v. Hodges, making same-sex marriage legal everywhere in the US. \nThe R v Van der Peet case in 1996 is important for understanding Aboriginal rights according to Section 35 of the Constitution Act. The court ruled that Native people don't have the right to sell fish for profit from their fishing activities. This判决形成了Van der Peet test, a method to decide if an Aboriginal right exists. It's part of a series called the Van der Peet trilogy, which also includes R v NTC Smokehouse Ltd and R v Gladstone. \nIn the case of United States v. Binion (132 F. App'x 89, 8th Cir. 2005), the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals used two important Supreme Court decisions, United States v. Booker (543 U.S. 220, 2005) and United States v. Fanfan (also 543 U.S. 220, 2005), to examine a sentencing decision made by the trial court and later approved by the Federal District Court for the Eastern District. They reviewed the case and ultimately upheld the original ruling. \nIn 1999, the Lau Kong Yung v. Director of Immigration case was a significant legal ruling in Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal. This case came after the Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration decision. Before Lau's case went to the CFA (Courts of Final Appeal), the NPCSC (National People's Congress Standing Committee) in China provided an interpretation of the Basic Law, which influenced Lau's situation. This made Lau's case unique because it was the first time the CFA had to consider an NPCSC interpretation when applying the Basic Law. \nThe Norwood, Ohio v. Horney case was heard by the Ohio Supreme Court in 2006. It happened after the famous Kelo v. City of New London case where the US Supreme Court allowed using eminent domain for commercial development. While Kelo dealt with the US Constitution, Norwood focused on the specific rules in the Ohio State Constitution. \nDuring Morrison Waite's time as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from 1874 to 1888, they saw a huge increase in criminal cases. In just fourteen years, they heard 106 cases, which was almost as many as the court had handled since its beginning until Waite became Chief Justice. Some important cases from this period include United States v. Cruikshank, United States v. Reese, Reynolds v. United States, Wilkerson v. Utah, the Trade-Mark Cases, Strauder v. West Virginia, and many more. \nThe Marshall Court, which was active from 1801 to 1835, heard about one criminal law case per year. Some notable cases include United States v. Simms (1803), United States v. More (1805), Ex parte Bollman (1807), Hudson (1812), Cohens v. Virginia (1821), United States v. Perez (1824), Worcester v. Georgia (1832), and United States v.

The colors on the pavilion were freshened up in the 1920s and again in the 1960s. Not many people knew about its history until recently. The story of Bhima Swarga, a part of a big Hindu story called the Mahabharata, is painted on the ceiling of the Kertha Gosa Pavilion. It's just a small part of the whole story. \nThe Oleson Park Music Pavilion, also called the Karl King Bandshell, is in Fort Dodge, Iowa. It was made because of Karl King, a famous band composer, who wanted it. An architect named Henry L. Kamphoefner, who had designed another music pavilion in Sioux City, made this one. The government's Works Progress Administration (WPA) paid for most of it, and the city of Fort Dodge paid the rest. It's built like a modern building with fancy decorations and has great sound.

Washington Street is the main road in the neighborhood. The waterfront has a park with a part of Liberty State Park, and there's a train stop called Paulus Hook on Essex Street and a water taxi at Warren Street. The light rail and new office buildings have brought more businesses, like restaurants with outdoor seating and small shops, to Morris Street. \nA sala is an open pavilion in Thailand, often found in Buddhist temples (wats) for meetings and protection from weather. It's open on all sides and building one gives religious merit. Temples have different types of salas: some for sermons and teachings (sala kan parian), and others for administrative purposes (sala wa kan or sala klang changwat). \nCorus Quay, initially known as First Waterfront Place, is an eight-story office building in Toronto, Canada. It sits on a 2.5-acre waterfront area near Jarvis Street. This $160 million project was the first big development for the East Bayfront area. It's now the home of Corus Entertainment, where they combined 10 offices and 1,200 employees into one location. The Toronto Economic Development Corporation (TEDCO), a city agency, built and funded the project with help from city loans, equity, and a $12.5 million grant from Waterfront Toronto. \nThe Grandview Park Music Pavilion is a special building in Sioux City, Iowa. In 1930, the Monahan Post Band wanted to build a small music stage in the park. But the neighbors didn't like the plan, so the band had to wait and find a better design. In 1933, after President Franklin D. Roosevelt started a program called the Civil Works Administration, the city asked to include the music shell. A local architect named Henry L. Kamphoefner made the plans, and Herschel Elarth designed the decorations. The project got approved and was built with help from the government and the city. It was finished in 1934 and could hold 5,000 people. The Monahan Post Band played there until 1948, and now it's called the Sioux City Municipal Band. They still perform during the summer.

It's where Sporting Kansas City plays their games. The stadium opened in 2011 and had its first match against the Chicago Fire. It can hold up to 18,467 people, but can expand to 25,000 for concerts. About 21,000 people usually come to watch SKC games because the stadium can change size. Before this one, the team played in three different places. In 2013, the stadium hosted some very important soccer events, like the MLS All-Star Game, the US men's national team, and the MLS Cup. This makes it a special place for soccer in the United States. \nCommunityAmerica Ballpark is a baseball field in Kansas City, Kansas, near the Piper neighborhood.

They played at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. During that time, MLS didn't allow games to end in ties, so they used shootouts to settle draws. However, when looking at their stats, shootouts are not included, which is why their regular season point total appears to be 63 instead of the actual 49 points they earned. A shootout victory was worth 2 points, and a loss was worth 0 points. \nIn the 1999 Kansas City Wizards soccer team's season, they played at Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri. Since the league didn't allow ties, they used shootouts to decide between tied games. The stats don't count shootout goals, so even though their regular season points should have been 20, it's shown as 24. If a shootout ended in a win, the team got 2 points, and 0 points for a loss. Their manager, Ron Newman, was replaced by Bob Gansler during that time. \nIn 2004, the ninth championship game of Major League Soccer, called MLS Cup, happened between two teams, D.C.

He has a lot of experience in soccer management, having worked as the boss of the Richmond Kickers (in a league called A-League/Division 2) and the Kansas City Wizards (now called Sporting Kansas City) in a higher level league, Major League Soccer. \nThe Kansas City Wizards' 1998 season was their third in Major League Soccer (MLS). They played all their home games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. A unique rule in 1998 was that soccer matches couldn't end in ties, so they used shootouts to decide the winner. Because of this, the statistics don't include shootout goals, and even though the team's total points for the regular season should have been 32, it's shown as 36.

Harry Heilmann and Ty Cobb were the top two hitters, with batting averages of .394 and .389, respectively. All three Tigers outfielders excelled in batting and RBIs. However, their lack of strong pitching was their biggest issue - the team's overall ERA was 4.40, they allowed nine or more runs frequently, and only one pitcher, Dutch Leonard, had an ERA below 4.24. This highlights the saying that good pitching is more important than hitting. \nCharles Henry Chick Shorten was an American baseball player who played as an outfielder from 1911 to 1928. He played for various teams like Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, St. Louis Browns, and Cincinnati Reds, with the Red Sox winning the World Series in 1916 where he had an impressive .571 batting average. In his eight seasons in the Major League Baseball, he played in 527 games, with 352 as an outfielder, and had a career batting average of .275. \nBaseball batting average (AVG) shows how often a batter gets a hit during an at bat. In Major League Baseball (MLB), the player with the highest AVG at the end of each season wins a title. There are separate titles for the American League and the National League. To qualify, a player must have at least 3.1 chances to bat per game. Sometimes, a player might not meet this requirement but still have the highest AVG. If that happens, they still win the title. For example, in 1996, Tony Gwynn had a high AVG even though he didn't have the exact number of plate appearances. He would have dropped slightly if he had a few more at-bats, but his AVG would still have been higher than anyone else's, so he won the title."}], "output": "\nBig Hurt.**"},

He talks about reality not as separate parts, but like a flowing process, similar to ideas from process philosophy or Greek philosopher Heraclitus. Bergson believes reality is too complex to understand fully by breaking it down into tiny pieces. Instead, he thinks we can truly grasp reality by using our intuition, which means connecting with it on a deeper level, like 'entering' the object. \nDuration, as explained by French philosopher Henri Bergson, is a concept he developed to understand time and consciousness better. Bergson believed that Herbert Spencer's ideas were incomplete because Spencer didn't fully grasp mechanics. Bergson felt that time is something that can't be measured or explained by math or science, because when we try to measure it, it's already gone. Time can seem to move faster or slower for each person, but for scientists, it remains constant.\n\nBergson focused on the personal experience of time, which he called duration. This is a unique, unquantifiable aspect of our lives that cannot be fully described or captured by words or images. To understand duration, one must use their imagination to grasp it intuitively, as it's something that can only be felt, not fully explained. \nSamuel Eliot Morison was a well-known American historian who specialized in maritime and American history. He earned his PhD from Harvard in 1912 and taught there for 40 years. Morison won Pulitzer Prizes for his biographies of Christopher Columbus and John Paul Jones. He also wrote a comprehensive history of US naval operations during World War II, published in 15 volumes between 1947 and 1962. Morison authored the popular Oxford History of the American People and co-wrote The Growth of the American Republic with Henry Steele Commager. Throughout his life, he received numerous honors, including honorary degrees, literary awards, military commendations, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, among others. \nOn April 18, 2011, the Pulitzer Prizes were announced. The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times each won two awards, with the former receiving the top honor for Public Service. Surprisingly, no prize was given in the Breaking News category. The Wall Street Journal won after a four-year break since 2007. Jennifer Egan's A Visit From the Goon Squad, which had previously won the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award, won the Fiction prize. Notably, Carol Guzy from The Washington Post made history by being the first journalist to win four Pulitzer Prizes. \nIn his 1907 book Creative Evolution, French philosopher Henri Bergson introduced the concept of Élan vital. He used it to discuss how things, especially living organisms, grow and develop on their own without any external guidance. Bergson believed this vital force was connected to consciousness, like how we feel and experience things, and the inner sense of time passing. Some people call it vital impetus or vital force when they don't agree with Bergson's ideas. \nTime and Free Will is a book written by Henri Bergson when he was a PhD student. It came out in 1889. The book talks about the idea of free will, which many philosophers have trouble with. Bergson believes that this confusion happens because people wrongly connect things that are not extended, like thoughts, with things that are extended, like actions. His theory about time, called duration, became very popular among thinkers in Europe later on. \nMoina Mathers, an artist and believer in the occult, lived during the early 1900s. She had a famous brother, Henri Bergson, who was a Jewish philosopher and won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927. Moina is best known for marrying Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, a key member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. After his death in 1918, she led a group called the Rosicrucian Order of the Alpha et Omega. \nMatter and Memory is a book by philosopher Henri Bergson from 1896. It discusses the connection between the body and spirit, focusing on memory as a way to understand this relationship. Bergson wrote this in response to Théodule Ribot's book, which said that memory is a material part of the brain. Bergson disagreed, believing memory is spiritual and helps guide our actions. He thought that brain problems could affect memory's usefulness, but not erase it completely. Memories just don't work properly when they're not fully realized in the brain."}], "output": "\nThomas Friedman.**"},

They started in 1983 and are located in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. In 1999, they had 60 stores that only opened for the Halloween season and were later bought by Spencer Gifts. \nSpencer Gifts, also known as Spencer's, is a popular store chain in North America with more than 600 shops in the US and Canada. They sell fun and unusual gifts, like clothing, band stuff, sex toys, home decorations, action figures, jewelry, and things related to fantasy and horror. They also have a separate store called Spirit Halloween during the Halloween season.\nA warehouse store is a discount grocery store that sells food and everyday items at lower prices than regular supermarkets. These stores have a simple layout, lots of shelves with products meant to sell quickly, and no membership fees. You can find bulk items, and the stores usually have a special entrance with discounted deals, followed by produce, deli, bakery, and other supermarket sections. Customers have to pack their groceries themselves to save money. Big grocery chains like Kroger and Albertsons run warehouse stores to attract more budget-conscious shoppers and keep costs low in their regular stores. There's also a chain called WinCo Foods that is entirely dedicated to warehouse shopping. \nSol Price, who later created Price Club, initiated FedMart, a discount store chain. He began in San Diego at an old airport hangar, catering specifically to government workers with a $2 family membership fee. The store thrived in its first year and expanded rapidly over the next two decades to 45 stores, generating over $300 million annually. FedMart expanded across the Southwest, often replacing White Front or Two Guys stores. In 1975, Price sold a majority stake to Hugo Mann, a German retail chain, which led to Price's removal from leadership. Unfortunately, FedMart ceased operations in 1982. \nWalt Whitman Shops is a fancy mall in Huntington Station, New York, on Walt Whitman Road and New York Avenue. It has big stores like Bloomingdale's, Lord & Taylor, Macy's, and Saks Fifth Avenue. A company called Melvin Simon and Associates owns it and manages other malls too, like Roosevelt Field. You can get to the mall by bus from Suffolk County Transit, Nassau Inter-County Express, and Huntington Area Rapid Transit. \nCitadel Mall, a big shopping center in South Carolina, opened in 1981. It's in Charleston and has 1.1 million square feet of space. The mall has over 100 stores, with big stores like Belk, Dillard's, Dick's Sporting Goods, Sears, and Target (which has a grocery section now). In 2013, the mall had money problems and was sold at an auction. Now, it's being sold to a new owner, but we don't know who yet. \nHalloween Adventure Stores is a popular store chain that sells things for Halloween, like costumes, masks, and decorations. They are really big, especially in the US, and were started by two brothers in 1981 in Philadelphia. The stores are usually in malls during the holiday season and can be found in states like Pennsylvania, New York, and Florida. They also have an online store because people sometimes look for better prices online after seeing something in the store. They compete with another store called Halloween Thrills. \nThe Eastern Hills Mall is a shopping center in Clarence, New York, near Buffalo. It's on a road called Transit Road, which separates Clarence from Amherst. The mall has a unique shape with two long parts going north and south and a short one going east-west. Big stores are at the ends of each long part. There's a food court, a movie theater, and a small DMV office inside. The mall has a huge parking lot, mostly used by car dealers for extra space. It's not very busy, and many stores are empty or have closed down. Some people think of it as a dying mall, with mostly small, local businesses now instead of big chains. \nThe Crossings at Northwest, which was once called Northwest Plaza, was a big shopping mall in St. Ann, a part of St. Louis, Missouri. It was the 27th biggest mall in the US before it closed. The mall was really huge, with 177,000 square feet of space for stores, and it was the biggest one inside Missouri. It had nine main stores and over 210 others. Now, the same people who own it plan to tear it down and build something different, called a lifestyle center. In 2010, it became the second mall in the St. Louis area to close after St. Louis Centre. They started changing the name to The Crossings at Northwest and making big changes to the area. \nThe Rolling Acres Mall, built in 1975 in Akron, Ohio, was a big shopping center with over 140 stores, a movie theater, and food court. It had five main stores as anchors. But in 2008, the mall closed, and only two stores, Sears and JCPenney, stayed open. Sears closed in 2011, and JCPenney changed its name to JC's 5 Star Outlet but closed all stores, including the one in Rolling Acres, in 2013. Now, the mall is empty, with Storage of America and Pinnacle Recycling inside. It's called Rotting Acres Mall because of the mold and how it's falling apart since it stopped being used. The mall's sad look even appears on The Black Keys' album cover."}], "output": "\n600.**"},

Additionally, he has written or contributed to more than ten textbooks. \nBerea College is a special school in Berea, Kentucky, where they teach different subjects and also help students with jobs. It's about 35 miles away from a bigger city called Lexington. This college is special because it gives free education to everyone, and it was the first school in the south that let boys and girls study together and didn't care about people's skin color. They give a full scholarship, like a big money prize, to every student who gets accepted, which is worth $97,200 for four years or $24,300 each year.\nAltruism is an idea that says being good depends on how your actions make others happy, not what happens to you. People who believe this say things like, An action is right if it helps everyone else, even if it doesn't benefit the person doing it. Auguste Comte suggests we should live to help others.

It's a requirement for all students, not just those who need help with fees (unlike a program called Federal Work Study). Students get evaluated on their work performance and can be let go if they don't meet expectations. They do various jobs on campus and take pride in their community. This system helps these colleges operate efficiently and keep costs low, making tuition more affordable. \nLiberal arts colleges focus on giving undergraduate students a well-rounded education in subjects like general knowledge and intellectual skills, rather than just preparing them for a specific job or trade. This type of education started in Europe but is now commonly linked with the United States. Liberal arts colleges can be found worldwide, and there are many international institutions that offer similar programs, like the Association of American Colleges and Universities' list. \nA liberal arts college focuses on giving undergraduate students a well-rounded education in arts and sciences. It teaches a variety of subjects to broaden knowledge and develop general thinking skills, unlike schools that concentrate on specific professions. Students typically choose a main subject but also learn about many other areas, inspired by both European and especially American higher education traditions. \nNancy K.

They get this name because of a rule made in 1960 that says they can use it if they don't have fancy royal titles. Some people with royal titles might use Mountbatten-Windsor when they need a last name too. \nThe Mountbatten family is a European royal family that comes from the German Battenberg family. During World War I, they changed their name in the UK because people there didn't like Germans. The name Mountbatten is from the German town Battenberg. A branch of the Hesse-Darmstadt family, which is a part of the larger House of Hesse, was given the title of count or prince of Battenberg in the 1800s, but it wasn't an official marriage.\nThe Zulu royal family includes King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, who is the current leader of the Zulus in South Africa. He is related to King Mpande, who ruled from 1840 to 1872 and was a half-brother of King Shaka. Shaka's actions made the Zulu clan powerful and their kingdom covered a large part of present-day KwaZulu-Natal before colonial times. \nA cadet branch in history is when the children, especially the sons, of a king or an important family's older sons get less of everything, like land, titles, and money. This is because the main son usually gets everything first, and the younger sons, called cadets, don't get as much to pass on to their own kids. This tradition is common in many rich families in Europe and Asia. \nThe Capetian dynasty, also called the House of France, is a royal family from Germany that started with Hugh Capet. It's one of the oldest and biggest royal families in Europe and has been around since Hugh Capet became the ruler in 987. They stayed in power in France until 1328 when Charles IV passed away. After them, other branches like the Houses of Valois and Bourbon ruled until the French Revolution happened. \nBatonishvili is a special name for royal kids from Georgia's Bagrationi dynasty. It means child of a lord. Important people like princes and princesses with this title include Alexandre, Ioane, and Nino. They get this title if they're related to past kings, not just the current king's kids. When they were talked to, they were usually called Most Brilliant or Most High. \nThe House of Capet, also known as the House of France or simply Capets, ruled France from 987 to 1328. They were part of the Capetian dynasty, which came from the Robertians. In the 1800s, historians started using Capetian to describe both the ruling family and their male descendants from Hugh Capet. They were the third group of kings, after the Merovingians and Carolingians. The name Capetian comes from Hugh Capet's nickname, who was the first king of this line. \nThe Duke of Leuchtenberg was a title given by the rulers of Bavaria to their family members twice. The first time was by Elector Maximilian I to his son Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus. When Maximilian Philipp died without children, the title went back to his nephew, Elector Maximilian II. Later, in 1817, King Maximilian I Joseph created the title again and gave it to his son-in-law, Eugène de Beauharnais. Eugène was related to Napoleon I, who had been emperor of France. After losing his other titles, Eugène became the next in line to inherit the kingdom after the royal family, but not from the male side. \nThe House of Windsor is the royal family of countries that follow Queen Victoria's rule. It includes men who are related to Queen Victoria or Queen Elizabeth II through their direct male line. If a male-line woman marries, she stops using the Windsor name according to certain agreements made in 1917 and 1952. \nThe Muhammad Ali dynasty had different rules for who could become the ruler of Egypt. At first, from 1805 to 1866, they followed the Ottoman rule that the oldest son would become the king. But in 1866, Isma'il Pasha, who was in charge, got permission from the Ottoman Emperor to only let his male descendants be the next in line. This rule stayed until 1953 when the monarchy ended after the Egyptian Revolution in 1952."}], "output": "\nHouse of Windsor.**"},

It was made up of old kingdoms called Mide, Osraige, and Leinster. A long time ago, in the 12th century, when people from Norman invaded Ireland, the areas of Leinster and Mide started to join together because of something called the Pale, which was in both places. This joining made the modern-day Leinster province. To manage and make decisions, these ancient kingdoms were divided into smaller areas called counties. Over time, more changes were made to these counties through local rules. \nPatrick Kennedy was a bookseller from Wexford, Ireland, born around 1801. He became famous for collecting and preserving Irish folktales, especially those from Leinster. His stories were told in a simple English style that reflected the language of Irish farmers who lived in the anglicized part of the country, known as The Pale. Kennedy is greatly appreciated for his efforts in keeping Irish expressions, words, and sentence structures alive during his time.\nSeumas MacManus, born on December 31, 1867, and passed away on October 23, 1960, was a talented Irish writer, playwright, and poet.

Later, a man named Joseph Jacobs republished the story, making a few small changes to it, as part of his collection of Celtic fairy tales. \nAmy Corzine is a writer and poet who has written both fiction and non-fiction. Her first work was a travel guide to Ireland for families, which featured her own stories inspired by Irish folktales.

He falls in love with Juliet, who is from a different family called the Capulets. They get married secretly. Because Romeo kills Juliet's cousin in a fight, he has to leave town. He sadly ends his life after thinking Juliet is dead, but she was not. \nBenvolio is a character in the play Romeo and Juliet. He is related to both Romeo and Montague - Romeo's cousin and Montague's nephew. In the story, Benvolio tries to stop the fighting between the Capulet and Montague families, but unfortunately, he isn't successful.\nHamlet is the main character in Shakespeare's play Hamlet. He is the prince of Denmark and wants to avenge his father's murder by Claudius, who took over the throne. Hamlet is confused and questioning his own mind throughout the story. In the end, he ends up causing the deaths of many people, including his father's enemies, two friends, his girlfriend Ophelia, and even his own mother, who died accidentally. \nMacbeth is a play by William Shakespeare, first acted in 1606. The story shows how political greed can harm people emotionally and physically. This play best represents Shakespeare's relationship with King James I, who supported his theater group. Macbeth was later printed in 1623 and is the shortest tragedy written by Shakespeare. \nRevenge tragedy, also known as revenge dramas or tragedies of blood, were popular plays in early modern England. Ashley H. Thorndike defined this genre in 1902, explaining that revenge tragedies are focused on revenge as the main motive and involve the pursuit of revenge, often resulting in the deaths of the murderers and sometimes the avenger. The Spanish Tragedy by Thomas Kyd (1580s) is often seen as the first example, but research now suggests that revenge tragedies existed even earlier, around 1560, with plays like Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca's works and Gorbuduc by Thomases Norton and Sackville. Shakespeare's Hamlet (1599-1602), Titus Andronicus (1588-1593), and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy (1606) are also well-known examples of this genre. \nShakespearean tragedy refers to the majority of tragic plays written by William Shakespeare. Although some of his historical plays are considered tragedies due to their tragic elements, they are classified as histories because they are based on real events in English history. On the other hand, plays like Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus, which have historical settings but foreign sources, are mostly categorized as tragedies. Later in his career, Shakespeare wrote tragicomic plays, a mix of tragedy and comedy, with a tragic hero but a happy ending, similar to his comedies. Scholar F.S. Boas introduced the concept of problem plays, which don't fit neatly into either tragedy or comedy, due to their unique themes, settings, or endings. Even today, experts sometimes argue about how to classify certain of Shakespeare's plays. \nRory Williams is a character from the popular British TV show Doctor Who. He was introduced in the 5th series and became a friend, or companion, of the main character, the Doctor, played by Matt Smith. Rory was originally worried because he thought his girlfriend Amy, who was also with the Doctor, loved the Doctor more than him. But later on, he became a brave hero and got married to Amy. They even had a baby together, but sadly, their baby was taken away. Rory and Amy found out that their friend River Song was actually their daughter. In the end, the Doctor and River got married, making Rory the Doctor's father-in-law. \nRomeo and Juliet is a 1954 movie based on William Shakespeare's famous play.

He was born on May 10, 1957, and unfortunately, he passed away on February 2, 1979. \nThe Flowers of Romance was a punk band started in 1976 by Jo Faull and Sarah Hall. Although they never performed live or made any music, the band is famous because some of its members later became well-known musicians. For example, Sid Vicious from The Sex Pistols, Keith Levene from The Clash and Public Image Ltd, and Palmolive and Viv Albertine from The Slits. In a fanzine called SKUM, Sid Vicious said he would stay true to his rebellious nature.\nGlen Matlock, a musician born on August 27, 1956, is well-known for being the first bass guitarist in the punk rock band the Sex Pistols.

They help in growing tissues, especially muscles, and are in the same group as hormones like estrogen and progesterone. The word anabolic comes from the Greek meaning to build up. \nAnabolic steroids, which come from the male hormone testosterone, are used to help build muscles and increase strength. People use them for looks and to perform better in sports and bodybuilding. These drugs make muscles grow faster than natural workouts. Teenagers and adults often use them because they speed up muscle growth.\nDocking is when someone cuts off the tail or sometimes even the ears of an animal. We usually call it cropping for ears and docking for tails, but sometimes people also use tailing. The word comes from dock, which means the part of the tail where the hairs grow. \nTensile testing is a crucial materials science test where a material is pulled until it breaks. This test helps choose the right material for different uses, checks its quality, and predicts how it will behave under normal forces. By measuring things like how much it stretches (ultimate tensile strength), how much it changes in size (maximum elongation), and how much it gets thinner (reduction in area), we can learn about other properties like Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, and how the material gets harder to stretch (strain-hardening). For most simple materials, uniaxial testing is enough, but for more complex ones like composites and textiles, biaxial testing is needed. \nSTOLports were special airports built for planes that need short runways, like those with small engines. They were popular in the 80s when London City airport had restrictions. These airports had short runways, usually less than 5000 feet, and could only handle certain types of planes, usually smaller ones with limited fuel. In the US, they just call these short runway airports, and the term STOLport isn't used much anymore. \nTrickle valves, also called vacuum valves, are used in factories to keep a dust collector's bottom clean while letting out the collected dust. They are cheaper than other types of airlocks. Trickle valves don't need electricity to work, which is good for machines like trenchers that need a dust-free space for smooth operation. They were made for this exact job. \nMethyltestosterone, also known by names like Agovirin, Android, and Testred, is a man-made medicine that combines strength-boosting and male hormone effects. It helps treat low testosterone levels in men and has other medical uses. Some people, especially athletes and bodybuilders, use it without a doctor's permission to improve their appearance or performance. Methyltestosterone was created in 1935, right after scientists found testosterone. Although it's not as popular as some other similar medicines, doctors still prescribe it today. \nThe Belling-Lee connector, also called the IEC 61169-2 type 9,52 connector, is a popular choice for TV antenna connections in Europe and Australia. It's often referred to as a PAL antenna connector, IEC antenna connector, or simply TV aerial plug. This connector is used to join coaxial cables, antennas on rooftops, signal boosters, cable TV equipment, TVs, and radio receivers. It's an older but widely used connector in everyday devices. \nMetandienone, also called Dianabol, is a type of synthetic drug that helps build muscles and is similar to testosterone. It was once used for medical purposes but is now mostly banned in most countries. Some people still use it to improve their performance, especially in sports. \nPox is a special drink made from corn, sugar cane, and wheat that the Mayans in Mexico and Central America use during important ceremonies. It's called aguardiente and has a big role in their culture. In the Chiapas area, people also enjoy it as an alcoholic drink. The word pox in Tzotzil means something like medicine or a healing drink. In the town of San Juan Chamula, they used to use it a lot in religious events and celebrations, but now they're using soda more often."}], "output": "\nMethyltestosterone.**"},

It's originally from Madagascar and Africa. This plant belongs to the dogbane family, which is called Apocynaceae. The name Pachypodium comes from Greek words that mean thick-footed because it has a thick base or root. \nStenocereus is a type of tall, skinny cactus that grows in places like Mexico, Arizona, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela, and some Dutch islands. It's related to the unique chinoa or chende cactus called Polaskia chende. Sometimes, other cactus species are added to this group too.\nCoprosma repens is a type of flowering plant that can grow into a shrub or a small tree. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is native to New Zealand. You might also know it by other names such as tree bedstraw, taupata, mirror bush, looking-glass bush, New Zealand laurel, or shiny leaf. \nNitrogen assimilation is the process by which living things, such as plants, fungi, and certain bacteria, convert inorganic nitrogen compounds found in the environment into useful organic compounds like amino acids. Those that can't convert nitrogen gas (N) directly, like plants and fungi, rely on taking in nitrate or ammonia. On the other hand, animals solely depend on organic nitrogen from the food they eat. \nParkia timoriana, also known as tree bean, is a flowering plant from the legume family. It has various names in different places like petai hutan in Borneo, yongchak in Manipur, and more. Native to countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Assam in India, it's commonly grown for food, wood, and as an attractive plant. \nThe poem starts by talking about a strong tree, like a giant, called the Casuarina Tree. A creeper, like a big snake, wraps around it tightly, but the tree is so tough it can handle it. The creeper has pretty red flowers that look like a colorful scarf on the tree. At night, the garden is alive with the sound of a nightingale's song. In winter, a baboon family plays in the tree while watching the sunrise. The tree is special to the poet because it brings back happy memories with her siblings, and she wants to remember it always. She compares her love for the tree to Wordsworth's love for the Yew trees. The poet hopes that her poem will keep the memory of the Casuarina Tree alive, even after she's gone. \nDavey Tree Expert Company is an American company that takes care of trees, utilities, lawns, and offers environmental advice.

They have three parts: Residential, Commercial, and Utility services. \nThe Bottle tree, a type of plant in the Pachypodium genus, got its name from Fernando da Costa Leal, a Portuguese geologist from the 1800s. He discovered it during a trip to southern Angola. \nA weak heap is a special type of data structure that combines features from both binary heap and binomial heap to create a priority queue. It's similar to a binary heap in that it can be stored in an array as a tree, and it has the same efficiency benefits as a binary heap. \nDurvillaea willana is a type of kelp that looks similar to D. antarctica but grows in more protected areas near the coast. It has smaller leaves and is usually found closer to the ground because it can't handle strong waves as well as D. antarctica. In New Zealand, it doesn't have a common name but people often mistake it for bull kelp. The stalks of D. willana are thick and long, with small branches branching off, giving it a tree-like appearance. The fronds are different from D. antarctica, not having a honeycomb pattern. The holdfast, which anchors it, becomes large and spreads like a flat plate on rocky surfaces."}], "output": "\nOnly Pachypodium can include tree-like plants.**"},

He was a skilled violinist, teacher, and priest. People all over Europe knew about his music during his time. Vivaldi wrote many different concertos, including ones for the violin and other instruments, as well as religious songs and more than 40 operas. His most popular creation is a group of violin concertos called The Four Seasons.\nLorenzo Ratti was an Italian composer from around 1589 to 1630, known for his work in the Baroque style.

It's where the Waimea River meets the sea, and there's a valley called Waimea Valley nearby. In Hawaiian, Waimea means reddish water. \nCharles Van Artsdalen was a famous surfer born in Norfolk, Virginia, who moved to La Jolla, California, when he was 14. He is well-known for being one of the first to surf huge 25-foot waves at popular spots like Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach in Hawaii. During the 1960s and 1970s, he also became an expert in riding tubes. As a member of the Duke Kahanamoku Surf Team, he appeared in surf films and was a well-known figure in the global surfing world until he passed away due to alcohol-related health problems in 1979.\nBrylan Van Artsdalen is an American MMA fighter who fights in the Featherweight category. He has been a professional since 2010 and has previously competed in events like Bellator and CES MMA. \nDonald West VanArtsdalen, born on October 21, 1919, is a respected judge who has been serving as a Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \nMister Pipeline is a special name for really good surfers who are experts at riding waves at a famous spot called Pipeline in Hawaii. The title was first given to Butch Van Artsdalen and later shared with famous surfers like Gerry Lopez, who acted sometimes, and Mike Stewart, a bodyboarding legend. This title is decided by everyone's agreement, and it's passed down from one great surfer to another. \nSkimboarding is a fun sport where you ride on a small board without fins, gliding on the water to meet waves and then go back to shore. You can do cool tricks like spinning and jumping in the air while riding the waves. Different from surfing, you start on the beach and use the energy from past waves to catch bigger ones. There's also a part called flatland, where you do skateboard-like tricks on the water waves without catching waves to go back to shore. This sport started in California when lifeguards wanted to surf in areas with fast and shallow water. Since then, skimboarding has grown, allowing people to do amazing aerial moves and even get pulled by boats into bigger waves. A professional named Brad Domke showed this new trick in a video. \nTow-in surfing is a way to surf on faster waves by using a tool to help. People created this method to ride huge waves and break the 30-foot record. It's a huge improvement in surfing and very important in its history. \nWaimea Canyon, often called the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, is a huge canyon in Hawaii. It's about 10 miles long and can be up to 3,000 feet deep. The name Waimea means red water because the canyon's soil is reddish. This amazing natural wonder was created by a river named Waimea, which carved through the land due to lots and lots of rain on the nearby mountain, Mount Waiʻ aleʻ ale, which is one of the wettest places in the world. \nWaimea is a well-known name in both Hawaii and New Zealand. In Hawaiian, it refers to reddish water, but in the Maori language, it doesn't have any specific meaning. This name can be associated with various things in these places. \nLake surfing is when you surf on a lake, but it's trickier than ocean surfing because the waves don't last long when the wind changes direction. This means you have to be quick to catch good waves because they disappear soon. Lake surfers often surf during storms, while ocean surfers ride waves from storms far away that take time to reach the shore. High winds can make the waves rough and make paddling harder due to less buoyancy in fresh water. Another difference is that lake water is fresh and safe from things like sharks and jellyfish, which ocean surfers might worry about."}], "output": "\nWaimea Bay.**"},

It copied the American M1 Garand but had a special 10-round magazine and used Japanese bullets. Instead of a clip, it had two 5-round clips inside. It had Japanese-style sights. This rifle was part of many experiments, but none were used during the war because only 250 were made and some were incomplete.

The game has a fixed time, like 2 hours, and the winner is the one with the most money, assets, or when there are no more companies, bank items, or treasury bonds left. It's designed to teach players about economics and how it connects to politics. Different versions were made for different countries, and Poleconomy combines the words politics and economy.\nPashmina is a special kind of soft and fine wool that comes from goats. It was first made into pretty clothes in a place called Kashmir in India. The word Pashmina comes from a language called Persian and means soft gold in the local language.

The town has about 8,211 people living there and is located where two big highways, I-77 and I-81, meet. This makes it a popular spot for travelers. During the Civil War, Wytheville was very important and was attacked twice. It's also where Edith Bolling Wilson, who was married to President Woodrow Wilson, was born. \nInterstate 81 (I-81) is an 855-mile highway. In Virginia, it stretches for 324.92 miles, which is the longest part of the route in any state. This highway starts at the Tennessee border near Bristol and ends at the West Virginia border near Winchester.\nInterstate 40 (I-40) is a highway that goes from Barstow, California to Wilmington, North Carolina. In North Carolina, it starts near the Pigeon River Gorge and comes from Tennessee. This highway goes through many cities like Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Durham, and Raleigh before ending in Wilmington. It passes through different landscapes like the Blue Ridge Mountains, hills, suburban areas, city centers, and farmland in eastern North Carolina. I-40 is the longest highway in North Carolina at 423.55 miles. There are also some smaller highways connected to it and a business loop in Winston-Salem. Even though the number 40 suggests an east-west direction, the part from Hillsboro to Wilmington mostly follows a north-south path. \nIn New York, there are 32 Interstate Highways, which are mainly divided into 9 main routes and 23 additional ones. The state's Department of Transportation, NYSDOT, takes care of most of these highways, but they use a different naming system. Instead of calling them directly by their number, they add the letter I after it. This helps to differentiate between the Interstates (like I-86) and regular state routes (like NY-86) without confusion. Sometimes, the numbers might look the same, but the I makes it clear which is which. \nIn Illinois, the Interstate Highways are part of a big road system run by the state. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) takes care of these highways. There are 13 main roads and 11 extra roads that together cover 2,248.93 miles. The longest highway is Interstate 57, which is 358.57 miles, and the shortest is Interstate 41, which is just 0.90 miles long. \nThis paragraph provides a list of 16 highways in Maryland that are part of the Interstate system. Six are main roads (primary) and ten are helper roads connected to the primaries. The longest main road is I-95, which is 110.01 miles long, and the shortest is I-81 at 12.08 miles. I-97 is the shortest main road and shortest within the state, standing at 17.62 miles. It's unique because it's entirely in one county and doesn't connect to other main roads. The longest helper road is I-695 (51.48 miles) and the shortest is I-295 (0.80 miles). The Maryland State Highway Administration maintains all Interstates except for specific segments of I-395, I-895, a part of I-695, the Baltimore area of I-95 and I-83. There's one unsigned Interstate called I-595, which is marked as US Route 50 and US 301. Lastly, I-170 used to be an Interstate but is now marked in gray. \nWhen Utah got new highways as part of the Interstate Highway System, the state government decided to make some changes to their own road system. They mainly gave numbers 1 to 5 to highways that would later become part of the Interstates. They also adjusted a few roads that were meant for state parks and places. These changes were mostly for planning future Interstates, as not much was built yet in 1962. Some changes from that year are no longer used. As the Interstates grew, more changes were made. In 1977, they made bigger changes, getting rid of some unsigned roads. \nIn the United States, there are extra roads called auxiliary Interstate Highways or three-digit Interstate Highways. These are like the main ones, but with some differences. They follow the same rules, get the same money from the government (90%), and have to meet other federal standards. \nIn Texas, the government takes care of the big roads called Interstate Highways. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is the group that makes sure these roads are safe and working every day. There are twelve main roads, seven extra ones, and a special part of I-35 called I-35E and I-35W that helps people reach Fort Worth and Dallas. The longest road is I-10, which is 878.6 miles long, and the shortest is I-110, only 0.9 miles. \nInterstate 85 (I-85) is a highway that connects Montgomery, Alabama and Petersburg, Virginia, as part of the national highway system. In Virginia, it stretches 68.64 miles, starting near the North Carolina border and going up to I-95 in Petersburg. The highway goes through Southside Virginia's eastern area, following closely alongside U.S. Route 1 (US 1) from Petersburg, where it also runs with US 460. Further south, it intersects with US 58, another major road in the area. I-85 serves as a vital link between the Richmond-Petersburg metro area and big cities in North Carolina like the Research Triangle. All along its route in Virginia, I-85 is considered a part of the National Highway System."}], "output": "\n8,211 people.**"},

This group is very powerful in California prisons and has about 155 to 300 official members, along with around 990 helpers who want to become full members by doing illegal things for them. \nThe National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame is a special place that celebrates really good athletes with Italian roots in the United States. It started in 1977 by George Randazzo, who wanted to help Catholic kids with sports. After a successful event, he made the bigger hall of fame to honor famous boxers and other sports stars like Lou Ambers, Eddie Arcaro, and Joe DiMaggio. Since then, more than 230 Italian-American athletes have been honored there.

Flemish weavers settled here in the 1400s, starting a tradition of wool and cotton weaving. The town grew and developed rapidly during the Industrial Revolution when textile production became big. In the early 1900s, Bolton was a thriving place with over 200 cotton mills and dyeing factories, making it one of the world's biggest cotton spinning centers. However, after World War I, the British cotton industry declined, and by the 1980s, cotton manufacturing in Bolton was almost gone. \nRivington Hall Barn is located next to Rivington Hall in Lancashire, not far from Chorley and Bolton. This barn might be quite old, possibly built between the 9th and 13th centuries, but it's more likely from the 16th century. In 1905, it was fixed up and changed by a person named Jonathan Simpson for Lord Leverhulme. It's an important building that has been given a Grade II listing.\nThe Manor of Rivington is a historic land property in Lancashire, England. It's believed to have existed even before the famous Domesday survey. The Pilkington family owned about six acres of land there before 1212. Over time, the estate split into parts, and by the 16th century, the Pilkingtons from Rivington Hall had a majority share of 5/8. In 1605, the Lathoms from Irlam owned a quarter, and the Shaws owned an eighth. \nAlmonte is a small town in Ontario, Canada, known for its old mill. It used to have its own government but is now part of the larger town of Mississippi Mills since 1998. This happened when three places, Almonte, Ramsay, and Pakenham, joined together. Almonte is about 46 km away from Ottawa's main city center and has around 5,000 people living there. \nThe Muddy Creek Forks Historic District is a special area in a village called Muddy Creek Forks in Pennsylvania. It has 12 old buildings, 1 place, and 5 structures that are important for history. These buildings and structures were built between 1800 and 1935. You can find a store, houses, a mill, a grain elevator, a warehouse, and a barn there. Most of them have a Victorian style. There are also two bridges, a corn crib, a place to weigh things, and a canal from a old mill and pond. \nWilton is a small town in Franklin County, Maine, where 4,116 people lived in 2010. It used to be a mill town but now it's mostly known for its fun activities and being close to Wilson Pond. \nRivington Hall is a special old building in Rivington, Lancashire, England. It was the main house for the people in charge of Rivington a long time ago. The house we see now has different parts because it was built after a wooden house from the 1500s, but we can't find any of that old house anymore. Now, it's someone's private home. \nSavage is a place in Maryland that is not a real town, but it has a special name. It's close to two big cities, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. It's also near Laurel and a big planned community called Columbia. In 2010, there were 7,054 people living there. It used to be a town with a mill, and there are still old buildings from that time, which are important and protected as a historic area called Savage Mill. \nBaron Burnham is a title given to important people in the United Kingdom. It was given to Sir Edward Levy-Lawson in 1903 because he owned a big newspaper called the Daily Telegraph. Before that, he became a Baronet in 1892. Sir Edward's dad, Joseph Moses Levy, got the newspaper not long after it started. \nStank Hall is a well-known old building in Beeston, a part of Leeds in England. It was built a long, long time ago, around the 1400s, for the Beeston family. In 1951, it became important and got a special Grade II listing from English Heritage. Right next to it, there's another old barn from the same time, also built for the Beeston family. This one is even more special, with a Grade II* rating. In the 1600s, the Hodgson family took care of it. In 2014, a group called the Friends of Stank Hall Barn bought the barn from the city to fix it up."}], "output": "\nBolton.**"},

It can work based on different cycles, like those by Sir George Cayley, John Ericsson, and Robert Stirling. These engines are different from internal combustion engines and steam engines. \nSir George Cayley, a famous English engineer, is a key figure in the history of aeronautics. He is known as the first person to scientifically study and understand how flight works, making him a pioneer in the field.\nElliott Stoddard created two engines called Stoddard engines. He first made one in 1919 and later improved it in 1933. These engines are special types called external combustion engines that use air or other gases like helium or hydrogen as a working fluid. They have valves and work with a single-phase gas inside. \nCharles Stephen Boreham was a shearer and trade unionist from New Zealand. He was born on December 19, 1857, in Richmond, Tasmania, which is in Australia. \nA gas-generator cycle is a type of rocket engine that uses both fuels. Some of the fuel is burned to create hot gas, which powers the engine's pumps. After that, the gas is released out. This engine gets its name because it loses some materials, making it an open cycle engine. \nAn external combustion engine is a type of engine where the fuel is burned outside the engine and the heat is transferred to a fluid inside. This fluid expands and causes the engine to move, doing work. The fluid is then cooled, often reused (in a closed cycle), or sometimes discarded and replaced (in an open cycle air engine). \nA working fluid is a type of pressurized gas or liquid that helps machines work. It can be steam in a steam engine, air in a hot air engine, or hydraulic fluid in things like hydraulic motors or cylinders. In a thermodynamic system, it's a liquid or gas that either gets energy or shares it with the system. \nThe Daboll trumpet is a type of foghorn invented by Celadon Leeds Daboll, an American from New London, Connecticut. It works like a small coal-powered hot air engine that compresses air inside a cylinder, and on top of it, there's a reed horn that makes the sound. \nDon Piccard, who comes from a family of flyers, was one of the first to create and sell modern hot air balloons in the 1960s. Along with other companies like Raven Industries, SEMCO, and Firefly Balloons (previously known as The Balloon Works), Piccard Balloons played a big role in making hot air ballooning popular by coming up with new and better designs. \nA Manson-Guise engine is a special type of hot air engine that uses temperature difference to move. It has a hot side and a cold side, and if the temperature difference is big enough, it works. This engine is simple because it has only one part that moves up and down, called a displacer piston and power piston. What makes it unique is that it can work both ways, like a spinning wheel that can turn clockwise or counterclockwise."}], "output": "\nSir George Cayley**"},

It is in some dog shows like Crufts, but not in the big World Dog Show. \nBasset Hounds are a short-legged dog breed from the hound family, known for hunting rabbits because of their excellent sense of smell, which is almost as good as a Bloodhound's. They are one of six types of basset dogs recognized in France.\nDog Tales is a 1958 Warner Brothers cartoon with funny sketches about dogs. There's a scene where a doberman pinscher teases an overweight soldier, and a dog is confused about whether it's a pointer or setter.

It's part of the scent-hound family, along with breeds like the Small Greek Dog, Irish Wolfhound, Bluetick Coonhound, Finnish Lapphund, and Basset Hound. Bulldogs have a strong build, a wrinkly face, and a unique nose that's pushed in. Groups like the American Kennel Club, The Kennel Club in the UK, and the United Kennel Club keep track of their breeding. In 2007, they were the fourth most popular dog breed in the United States, according to the American Kennel Club. \nFred Basset is a popular comic strip featuring a male basset hound. The cartoon was created by a Scottish artist named Alex Graham and first appeared in the Daily Mail on July 8, 1963. Since then, it has been shared in many countries around the world. \nA breed standard is a set of rules that describe how a certain type of dog should look, move, and behave. It's made by groups of people who love that dog breed, called breed clubs. These standards can be different depending on the club and the country. They're similar to rules for other farm animals. \nGiant dog breeds don't have a specific height or weight limit, but some people consider them big if they weigh more than 50 kilograms. These big dogs grow fast, but it takes them longer to become fully grown compared to smaller dogs. \nIn the United States, 12 states have chosen a special dog breed to represent them. Maryland was first, in 1964, when they picked the Chesapeake Bay Retriever. Pennsylvania came next and picked the Great Dane. Most state dog breeds come from where they were first born. North Carolina is proud of its Plott Hound because it's the only breed native to the state."}], "output": "\nLeonberger.**"},

It was later turned into an earldom as part of a bigger English kingdom. The name Northumbria came from the fact that it was located around the Humber estuary, which was its southern border. \nNorthumbrian was an old English dialect spoken in the Northumbria region during the Anglian Kingdom era. It is considered one of the smaller groups, along with Mercian, Kentish, and West Saxon, that scholars today classify under the broader category of Old English.\nThe Humberhead Levels are a special area in northern England near the Humber estuary. It's a flat, low-lying land that used to be a big lake during the ice age. It's surrounded by hills like the Yorkshire Wolds and a limestone ridge to the east, and the Vale of York and Trent Vale to the north and south, respectively. \nSouth Ferriby is a small village in England, located near the Humber Estuary. It's about 3 miles west of the famous Humber Bridge. There's another village called North Ferriby across the estuary, on the opposite side. In 2011, the village had a population of 651 people. \nThe Essex dialect, similar to East Anglian English, is mainly spoken in the north and east of Essex. It's close to Suffolk and Norfolk dialects. In the 20th century, due to urbanization and London's expansion, Estuary English, a gentler London accent, became more common in the southern part of Essex. This led to rural accents, including the Essex dialect, being more often heard among older generations in some areas. However, the dialect still exists in other parts of Essex. \nHumberside was a special area in northern England from 1974 to 1996. It included land around the Humber Estuary, parts of Yorkshire and Lincolnshire. The main office was in Beverley, and Hull was the biggest city. The area stretched from north to south and now mostly exists as the Hull and Humber Ports region. \nCumbrian dialect is a regional Northern English accent spoken in Cumbria, a historic area in England, but it's different from the old Celtic language. It sounds more like a North-East English accent and shares many words with the Scots language. There are even dictionaries, like the Cumbrian Dictionary by William Rollinson and a fun, modern one, to learn more about it. \nThere are two big forts located at the entrance of the Humber estuary in northern England. They are called Haile Sand Fort and Bull Sand Fort. \nThe M180 is a short but significant motorway in England, about 25 miles long. It starts at junction 5 of the M18 and goes near Humberside Airport, about 10 miles from Immingham port and 14 miles from Grimsby port. This road is important for connecting to places like Cleethorpes, Grimsby, Hull (via the Humber Bridge), Immingham, Lincoln, Scunthorpe, the airport, and some oil refineries. It's part of the unsigned Euroroute E22 and follows the south side of the Humber Estuary. It's unique because even though it's only 25 miles, it has a three-digit number, making it the longest such motorway in the UK. \nThe Humber Warhawks are a football team from Hull, Yorkshire, playing in the BAFA NFC South 2 league. They got their name from the Humber Estuary and the bridge connecting East Yorkshire and North East Lincolnshire. The team was created in 2014 when the Kingston Warhawks and Grimsby Scorpions joined forces. They became an official team in 2015 and started playing in that year."}], "output": "\nNorthumbrian.**"},

In 2010, there were 15,955 people living there. Liberty is the main town. This county was made in 1806 from a part of Lincoln County and named after a man named William Casey, who came to Kentucky with his family in 1779. Casey County is special because it's the only county in Kentucky that's completely in the Knobs area. They have an event every year called the Casey County Apple Festival. They don't allow alcohol there, and it's part of the Appalachian part of Kentucky. \nIn 1776, the Virginia government created three new counties from Fincastle County: Kentucky, Washington, and Montgomery. For about three and a half years, Kentucky County had Harrodstown (previously called Oldtown and later Harrodsburg) as its main town. \nThe Westervelt massacre, also called the Westerfield massacre, happened during the American Revolutionary War in 1780 in what is now Kentucky. A group of Dutch settlers, led by Jacobus Westervelt, were traveling from Low Dutch Station to Harrod's Town to escape British and Indian invaders. Unfortunately, they were ambushed and killed by the Indians, who were working with the British. The attackers were paid for each scalp they brought back.

Although women's football has been played in Gambia since 1998, the national team still has some work to do. They have young teams, like an under-17 team that has played in FIFA's world cup qualifying games, and an under-19 team that didn't join a regional tournament.

Before the EAFF existed in 2002, a different competition called the Dynasty Cup was played among the top four teams in the region, acting as a sort of unofficial championship. There are now separate competitions for both men (which started in 2003) and women (2005), and in 2005, there was a combined points system that added the scores of both men's and women's teams together (except for qualifying matches). \nGeraldine Donnelly is a Canadian soccer player who played as a midfielder.

In 2014, she was honored with a place in the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame. \nThe 1929-30 British Home Championship was a football tournament between the British countries. In 1930, a new big competition, the FIFA World Cup, started in Uruguay, which became a rival to the Home Nations' tournament. Because the Home Nations weren't part of FIFA due to disagreements about professional football, they didn't participate and said they wouldn't even go if invited, thinking foreign teams weren't strong enough. It's fun to imagine how things might have been different if they had played. The England team, who did well in the championship, had already lost to Spain, and the Scottish team, who usually won, hadn't played outside the UK much and lost to other teams later that year. \nThe 2016 L'Alcúdia International Football Tournament was a soccer event that happened in July and August of 2016.

The book came out in 1928. In his article, Freud points out that many famous stories, like Oedipus Rex, Hamlet, and The Brothers Karamazov, involve a son killing his father. He even connects this theme in Dostoevsky's work to the author's epilepsy. \nOedipus Rex, also known as Oedipus the King, is a famous play by Sophocles. It was first performed a long, long time ago, around 429 BC. At that time, people just called it Oedipus. Later, they added Tyrant to the title to tell it apart from another play called Oedipus at Colonus. In ancient times, tyrant meant a leader, not necessarily a bad guy.\nSigmund Freud wrote a book called The Interpretation of Dreams in 1899. In it, he talked about how our unconscious mind affects our dreams and introduced the idea of the Oedipus complex. He kept updating the book and added a big part in the third edition where he focused on the literal meaning of dream symbols, inspired by Wilhelm Stekel. Freud considered this kind of understanding a rare achievement. \nPeter Gay's biography of Sigmund Freud, titled Freud: A Life for Our Time, was released in 1988. It builds upon information from Ernest Jones' earlier work, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud from 1953, but includes fresh details. The book garners positive reviews, but also faces criticism from those who doubt the validity of psychoanalysis. \nHamlet, a character from Shakespeare's play created in the early 1600s, is widely known, copied, and studied. It significantly impacted psychology through Sigmund Freud's work on the Oedipus complex. This play has had a strong influence on literature overall. In fact, Hamlet's character is so iconic that it has influenced people's attitudes and even turned into a common term used in everyday language. \nIn 1965, philosopher Paul Ricœur wrote a book called Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation about the famous psychologist Sigmund Freud. This book is sometimes compared to another work by Jürgen Habermas. While some people have praised Ricœur's work, others believe he misunderstands Freud's ideas. \nJeffrey Moussaieff Masson's book, The Assault on Truth, claims that Freud deliberately ignored his theory that some mental health issues, like hysteria, could be caused by childhood sexual abuse. He did this because he didn't want to accept that kids could be victims of abuse by their own family. Masson knew this because he had access to some of Freud's private letters while working at the Sigmund Freud Archives. The book, first published in 1984, has had updated versions later on. \nRichard Webster's book Why Freud Was Wrong (first published in 1995, with updated editions in 1996 and 2005) critiques Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. He claims that Freud became like a religious figure, and psychoanalysis is more like a religious tradition than a science, based on Judaeo-Christian beliefs. Webster supports Gilbert Ryle's ideas from The Concept of Mind (1949) and criticizes other authors who discuss Freud. The book is well-regarded for its brilliance and impact on the ongoing debate about psychoanalysis, but it has faced criticism for its research and argumentation. \nPeter Swales, a Welsh historian who worked with the Rolling Stones, is known for his research on psychoanalysis. He uncovered the real names of some people who were treated by Sigmund Freud early on, using clues that took 25 years to find.

It's situated just north of the San Giovanni Baptistery in Florence, Italy. \nThe Florence Baptistery, also called the Baptistery of Saint John, is a special religious place in Florence, Italy. It's a bit like a small church and it's located between two squares - Piazza del Duomo and Piazza San Giovanni. You can find it right across from Florence Cathedral and a tall bell tower called Campanile di Giotto.\nThe Column of Phocas is a tall Roman column in Rome, Italy, right in the center of the Roman Forum. It was built to honor an emperor named Phocas in the year 608 and was the last thing added to the Forum. The column is made of white marble and has a fancy design called Corinthian. Some people think it was made a long time ago, maybe even in the 2nd century, for a different structure, and then they used it again for this column. The bottom part, called a socle, was taken from a statue of Diocletian that used to stand there. They had to remove some writing to make space for new words on the column. \nThe Colonna dell'Abbondanza is a big column you can see in a square called Piazza della Repubblica, in a place called Florence, which is in the Tuscany area of Italy. \nThe Column of the Vicariate was a white marble柱子 with a base, which used to be outside Castel Capuano on Via dei Tribunali in Naples, Italy. The government used it to punish people who owed money. \nPiazza Colonna is a central square in Rome's Colonna neighborhood, known for the big marble Column of Marcus Aurelius that has been there since 193 AD. On top of the column, there's a bronze statue of Saint Paul that was put up in 1589 by Pope Sixtus V. The street called Via del Corso goes through the eastern side of the square, from south to north. \nThe San Jacinto Monument is a very tall column, standing 567.31 ft high, located near Houston, Texas. It was built between 1936 and 1939 to remember an important battle called the Battle of San Jacinto. The top of the column has a big star that weighs 220 tons. This monument is the world's tallest made of stone, and you can go up to an observation deck by elevator to see the city and a battleship called the USS Texas. \nThe Pestsäule, also known as the Trinity Column, is a beautiful Baroque sculpture located in the center of Vienna, Austria. It was built in 1679 to remember the Great Plague and is very famous in the city. \nThe Peace Column, located in Mehringplatz, Berlin, is a tall structure built in 1843. It was created by Christian Gottlieb Cantian and has a brass Victoria statue on top, designed by Christian Daniel Rauch.

It likes to live in the forest near the ground and comes out after it rains in the afternoon, usually in the early evening. The name comes from a character in a famous book called The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. \nJ. R. R. Tolkien, an English author and scholar, wrote a famous book called The Lord of the Rings. It's a big fantasy story that started as a follow-up to his 1937 book The Hobbit. Over time, it grew much bigger. Tolkien wrote it in bits and pieces between 1937 and 1949, and it has sold more than 150 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books ever.\nSuanfa Tongzong, a math book from the 1500s by Cheng Dawei, focuses on basic calculations for the abacus. It has 595 problems in 17 chapters and was crucial for understanding math in China's tradition. In 1598, Cheng published another book, Suanfa Zuanyao, which mostly copied four chapters from the first one. When Suanfa Tongzong sold well, it caused a rise in paper prices and led to fake copies with mistakes. To stop this, Cheng made a shorter version. \nGollum is a character from J.R.R. Tolkien's stories. He first appeared in The Hobbit in 1937 and later played a big role in The Lord of the Rings. Gollum was a Hobbit from the River-folk, living near Gladden Fields. His name used to be Sméagol, but he became Gollum because he made a scary gurgling sound. \nAnthony Aguirre and Max Tegmark suggest a way to understand quantum mechanics in a universe that keeps expanding forever, making it huge with countless planets and many copies of everything. In this view, the quantum state of a system means all the real, identical copies of it existing in this big space. We don't need to worry about the wavefunction collapsing, and the uncertainty we feel is because we can't tell which copy of ourselves is experiencing things. \nAndy Serkis initially agreed to do a three-week voice-over for Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, but it turned into a much bigger project that took five years. He devoted a lot of effort to bring Gollum to life, even incorporating details like Gollum's distinctive cough. The book also talks about the challenges of combining live-action with computer-generated imagery (CGI) and the debate over whether Serkis should have received an Academy Award for his portrayal. \nMachine Head's third album, The Burning Red, became their second most popular in the US, selling as much in three years as their previous album Burn My Eyes did in almost eight (1994-2002). The album sold over 134,000 copies in the US and received a silver certification from the BPI in the UK for selling 60,000 copies. \nGollum is a type of shark that lives in the bottom of the ocean in the southwestern Pacific. It was discovered by a scientist named Leonard Compagno in 1973. He named it after a character from a book called J. R. R. Tolkien's works. There's a specific species called Gollum attenuatus, which is very thin and behaves similarly to the character in the book. \nIngerophrynus is a group of real toads with 12 different kinds. They can be found in places like southern Yunnan, Indochina, and countries in Southeast Asia like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This group was made when scientists changed how they classify frogs. Before, 10 of these toad types were thought to be part of the Bufo group. In 2007, a new species called Ingerophrynus gollum was added. It's named after a character from J. R. R. Tolkien's books. \nFrom Unknown Worlds is a collection of fantasy stories edited by John W. Campbell Jr. and illustrated by Edd Cartier. It features stories from the popular magazine Unknown from the 1930s and 40s. In 1948, Street & Smith, an American company, published it as a book to see if there was interest in bringing back the magazine. They printed 300,000 copies, but many were returned, so they didn't proceed with reviving it. The first British edition came out in 1952 from Atlas Publishing, with some hardcover versions. However, the story One Man's Harp was not included in this edition."}], "output": "\nOver 150 million.**"},

They started in 1989 and had a lot of success worldwide from the late 1990s to early 2000s. They released three albums: Aquarium (1997), Aquarius (2000), and Megalomania (2011). Aqua has sold about 33 million albums and singles, making them Denmark's most successful band ever in terms of money earned. \nIn 2002, Mattel and MCA Records had a legal dispute over the 1997 song Barbie Girl by Aqua. This lawsuit, called Mattel v. MCA Records, didn't go very far because it was eventually dismissed.\nDaze is a Danish dance band that became popular in 1997 with their album Super Heroes, which sold a lot and won a Grammy. The band has a fun, fast pop sound similar to Aqua. Their songs like Superhero, Tamogotchi, and Toy Boy were big hits, especially in Denmark and Argentina. Superhero was even nominated for a big award in 1997. \nAqua, a Danish dance-pop group, made a song called Lollipop (Candyman). This was their fourth single from their first album, Aquarium. They wanted it to be popular after their hit Barbie Girl. But in places like Australia, North America, and most of Europe, it didn't do as well as their other songs like Barbie Girl, Doctor Jones, and My Oh My.

Two tracks, Endless Summer and I Will Believe It, were previously recorded under the Siria name. The music is full of energetic trance beats, fast tempos, and Europop themes. The album talks about love, parties, and romance. \nAqua, a Danish dance-pop group, released 'Doctor Jones' as their fifth single after the huge success of 'Barbie Girl.' The song became another popular hit worldwide, proving that Aqua was not just a one-hit wonder.

Gibb or Reynolds v. Sims? \n\n Passage: \nReynolds v. Sims (1964) was a Supreme Court case. It said that when people in a state choose their legislature, all districts should have about the same number of people. This rule was made because it was unfair for rural areas to have less power than big cities. A man named M.O. Sims from Birmingham, Alabama, sued on behalf of Alabama voters. But this decision affected other states too, especially those in the north and south, who didn't adjust their legislature based on population changes. It happened because similar cases were also decided in Colorado, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware. \nIn the 1984 case Selle v. Gibb, the Seventh Circuit Court ruled that if there's no proof of copying through access (like having access to someone else's work) and the similarity between two works is so strong it's hard to believe they were created independently, without influence, or from a common source, it might suggest copying. However, just striking similarity isn't enough; it must be so unlikely that it points to copying, not just coincidence or a shared source.\nWest v. Barnes, decided in 1791, was the first case where the US Supreme Court required oral arguments. Prior to this, Van Staphorst v. Maryland was scheduled but settled before the Court could hear it. West was argued on August 2, 1791 and ruled on August 3. Collet v. Collet, another 1791 case, was initially listed for the Court but was dropped before it could proceed. The full opinions in West v. Barnes were not published by Supreme Court Reporter Alexander Dallas but were shared in newspapers. He did publish a summary of the decisions. \nThe Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd case was a significant ruling in English defamation law. It dealt with the issue of whether newspapers can publish defamatory statements about individuals if it's in the public interest. The case focused on the concept of qualified privilege, which protects publishers to some extent. \nGeorge Reynolds was a significant leader in the LDS Church, serving as a secretary to the top leadership. He also played a key role in a famous court case called Reynolds v. United States in 1878, which was the first time the US Supreme Court dealt with religious freedom. Reynolds lived from 1842 to 1909. \nJameel v Wall Street Journal Europe was a court ruling by the House of Lords about defamation laws in England. It supported Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd and allowed a public interest defense in cases where someone is accused of libel. \nIn the 1878 Supreme Court case called Reynolds v. United States, the court ruled that people cannot use their religious beliefs as an excuse to avoid a criminal charge. This was the first time the court talked about the rights to a fair jury and the right to confront witnesses in the Sixth Amendment. \nWhen Morrison Waite was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from 1874 to 1888, they handled a huge number of criminal cases - 106 in just 14 years! This was almost as many as the court had seen since it started. Some important cases from that time include United States v. Cruikshank, United States v. Reese, and many others listed. \nIn the 1955 court case Reynolds v. Pegler, a famous journalist named Quentin Reynolds won a significant libel lawsuit against the conservative writer Westbrook Pegler. This victory set a record with a huge $175,001 judgment against Pegler. \nCharles Morgan Jr., a civil rights lawyer from Alabama, was born on March 11, 1930, and passed away on January 8, 2009. He was famous for his significant contribution to the Supreme Court's one man, one vote rule in the Reynolds v. Sims case in 1964. Morgan also represented Julian Bond and Muhammad Ali in their legal fights for justice."}], "output": "\nSelle v. Gibb**"},

They are called andromedas or fetterbushes in North America. These are evergreen shrubs that grow up to 1-2 meters tall and 1 meter wide. Their leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern, like wheels, and have a leathery texture. In spring, the young leaves have bright colors. The flowers are bell-shaped, white or pink, and appear in bunches of five. After the flowers, the hard capsule splits into five parts to let out many tiny seeds. \nPhlebodium is a small group of ferns, with two to four types. These plants originally come from warm parts of the Americas, like the tropics and subtropics. People used to think of them as part of the Polypodium group, but now they are recognized as a separate genus.\nSinopieris is a group of butterflies from the Pieridae family. These butterflies can be found in places like Nepal, Tibet, Yunnan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan. Initially, all six species were part of the Pieris group. The main difference between Sinopieris and Pieris is the pattern on the forewing's top part. Most Sinopieris species have a grey or black area that spreads, while Pieris butterflies usually have one or two black spots on the forewing (males) or females, and no such markings on the hindwing. \nThe andromeda lace bug (Stephanitis takeyai) is an insect that attacks plants from the Pieris family, particularly the Japanese andromeda (Pieris japonica). It first appeared in Japan with the Japanese andromeda as its host, but it has now spread to other parts of the world. Interestingly, there's a species called Pieris floribunda that can withstand this bug. \nLeptosporangiate ferns are the biggest group of ferns, with about 11,000 species. They belong to the subclass Polypodiidae, but people sometimes classify them as Pteridopsida or Polypodiopsida. There are four main groups of ferns, and the leptosporangiate ferns are one of them. The others are Eusporangiate ferns, which have marattioid ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns/moonworts. \nPieris floribunda is a type of evergreen shrub native to North America, closely related to the blueberry family. It's also called mountain fetterbush or mountain andromeda. It's important to note that eating any part of this plant can be harmful. Growing it in your garden is not common because it's hard to propagate and doesn't always thrive in captivity. However, there are some specialized nurseries that can provide it. To care for it, plant it in a shady spot, away from strong winds, and give it a good soil with lots of organic matter, ideally with a pH between 4.5 and 6.5. \nPieris, commonly known as garden whites, is a butterfly family (Pieridae) found almost everywhere. The most diverse group is in the Palearctic region. These butterflies have caterpillars that mainly eat cabbage and plants from the Brassicaceae family. Scientists have studied their connection to these plants for over a century and discovered that caterpillars have special adaptations to break down chemicals called glucosinolates found in these plants. These insects can safely eat plants with glucosinolates, and female Pieris butterflies check for these chemicals before laying eggs on them.\n\nSome Pieris species, like the North American Pieris oleracea and Pieris virginiensis, are not pests and rely on specific native plants for food. However, many other species have become pests, spreading from Eurasia to other continents like South America and Africa, causing crop damage almost everywhere. \nThe Indian cabbage white, a butterfly in the Pieridae family, is similar to Pieris rapae which is also a member of the same family. \nThe golden polypody, also known by other names like golden serpent fern and cabbage palm fern, is a special kind of fern that grows on trees. It lives in warm places like the Americas, mostly on the east side. You can find it in states like Florida and Georgia in the US, and also in places like the Caribbean and South America, up to Paraguay. In North America, this is the only type of this fern, while in South America, there are more kinds. It has different names in different languages like Spanish, Hawaiian, Portuguese, and Swedish. \nTree ferns are special ferns that have their fronds raised above the ground because they have a trunk. Most tree ferns belong to three main families: Dicksoniaceae, Metaxyaceae, and Cibotiaceae, which are in a group called Cyatheales. Other fern families, like Osmundaceae and the fern genus Cibotium, can also be considered tree ferns because they can grow tall, with some even reaching up to ten meters. If we include ferns with shorter trunks, like those in Blechnum, Calochleana, and Cystodium, they could also be called tree ferns when we use the term loosely. Remember, the European tree fern is called Culcita."}], "output": "\nNo, Phlebodium is a group of ferns, while Pieris is a group of plants from the Ericaceae family, originally consisting of shrubs but later expanded to include butterflies.**"},

It was built in 1889 by a man named Charles A. Allen to help a businessman named Edwin Bartlett. Edwin wanted a better road for his mills and workers. The bridge is 30 feet long and 42 feet wide, with a pretty arch that's 13 feet tall. The outside of the bridge is made of rough-cut granite, while the arch is very carefully made with smooth granite stones. There are also strong walls made of big granite slabs on either side of the bridge. \nWorcester is a city in Massachusetts, the main town in Worcester County. It's named after a place in England. In 2010, there were about 181,045 people living there, making it the second most crowded city in New England, after Boston. It's about 40 miles west of Boston, 50 miles east of Springfield, and 40 miles north of Providence. Because it's in the middle of the state, people call it the Heart of the Commonwealth, and that's why a heart is the symbol of the city. Some say the heart symbol might come from the story that Valentine's Day cards were first made there.\nThe Sutliff Bridge is a special old bridge in a place called Sutliff in Iowa. It was built a long time ago in 1897 and 1898 by a company named Parker. People liked it so much that it became a famous spot, even for a fun race called the worst road race. But in 2008, big floods destroyed part of it. Now, they're fixing it and it will cost about $1.7 million. The government and people are helping to pay for it. In 2012, they opened the fixed bridge again after four years. \nThe Gardnerville Branch Jail is an old jail in Gardnerville, Nevada. It was built in 1910 to replace a small jail in Genoa, which was the county seat at the time. People in Gardnerville needed a better jail because the granary where they kept prisoners wasn't suitable. They asked the county to build a new one, but some leaders in Minden didn't want Gardnerville to become the new county seat, so they made a fuss. Despite the opposition, the jail was built and used to hold prisoners until 1915 when Minden got its own jail because it became the county seat. \nThe Cerro Gordo County Courthouse is in Mason City, Iowa. When the county was made in 1855, Mason City became the main town. But some people in the west of the county didn't like it, so they asked the state to move the county seat to Livonia and built a courthouse there. Many people in the county wanted it back in Mason City, and they won in 1858. Before the current modern building, which the county uses now, there were two courthouses in Mason City. The current one used to be the Standard Oil Building. The county bought it in 1959 for $159,400 and changed it to fit their needs. \nThe Old Allamakee County Courthouse in Lansing, Iowa, was a courthouse that didn't last long. It was built in 1861 because there was a disagreement between Lansing and Waukon about which town should be the county seat. Lansing had lost before but won again in 1861 with help from Columbus. Waukon built its own courthouse but didn't get to be the seat again in 1864. In 1866, a Waukon sheriff tried to take the county records, but people from Lansing stopped him. The Iowa Supreme Court finally said Waukon was the county seat in 1867, and that's where it is now. \nThe Henry Covered Bridge is an old bridge located in Bartlett, Ohio, about southeast from OH550 on TR61. It's part of Washington County and has a special design called Multiple Kingpost truss. This bridge is 45 feet long and was built way back in 1894. \nThe Shinn Covered Bridge is a special wooden bridge in Ohio, made by a local man named Charles T. Shinn in 1886. It's in the countryside, far from a place called Bartlett. The bridge has a metal roof and wood walls, with stone supports at the ends. It's designed like a mix of an old design by Andrea Palladio and a king post truss. Charles built it to cross Wolf Creek after a sad event where one of his kids drowned. The bridge is 98 feet long. \nThe Eisenhower Bridge is in Milton, Iowa, and helps cars go over the Fox River for about 197 feet. A long time ago, in 1887, people from two counties talked about building a bridge between them. They planned to put it on the Burlington-Fort Madison Road. But it took a while to get the money. They decided that Des Moines County would pay more, and Lee County would pay less. A smart engineer named Horace B. Horton made the design, and a company built it. The first bridge had two parts, but they made a new one in 1930. One part was moved to its current spot. This bridge, called the Eisenhower Bridge, replaced an old one from 1895 that was damaged in a flood. It's special because it's one of the few iron truss bridges left in Iowa, made by a famous engineer. In 1998, it became important and was added to a list of historic places. \nThe Main Street Bridge is a very old bridge in Charles City, Iowa. It goes over the Cedar River and is 248 feet long. People used to use a ferry, walk across the river in the summer or on the ice in winter before the bridge was built. The first two bridges were destroyed by floods. In 1870, a new bridge was made, but it was still there for 40 years even though an engineer said it should be taken down. In 1908, they decided to build a new one, but there were problems. Finally, in 1909, a company from Wisconsin built a new bridge with three big arches. It was finished in 1910 and cost around $40,000. The city and county paid for it. This bridge is now considered very important and was added to a special list in 1999."}], "output": "\nWorcester.**"},

These novels explore the impact of British colonial rule on both politics and people. \nLouis Aragon was a French poet known for being a key figure in the surrealist movement in France. Along with André Breton and Philippe Soupault, he started a famous literary magazine called Littérature. He also wrote novels, worked as an editor, was a member of the Communist Party, and had the honor of being part of the Académie Goncourt.\nThe Murree Rebellion in 1857, also called a war for independence, was a small battle between local tribes in the town of Murree (in today's Pakistan) and the British government in India. People had been unhappy with British control for many years. There were some smaller fights before, but in 1857, the rebellion felt like a bigger deal because people really believed it might end British rule. \nNiger's Constitution from 1999 states that it supports most human rights, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, there are still issues with the government, military, and police, and some traditional practices go against the constitution. In the past, when Niger was under French control and after independence until 1992, people had very few rights and the government was unpredictable. Although things have improved since the country started having civilian leaders, people are still concerned about human rights in Niger. \nIn 1985, Hong Kong made its first change to how leaders were chosen for the local government. This happened when Britain still ruled Hong Kong. They introduced indirect elections in a paper called Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong before an important agreement in December. This change helped start a system of democracy in Hong Kong, which continued until the handover to China in 1997 and continued to grow after that. \nLéo Ferré's album Les Chansons d'Aragon, released in 1961 by Barclay Records, is his second album inspired by a poet. The first one was about Baudelaire in 1957. This time, Ferré focuses on Louis Aragon, a former surrealist, but he sings songs from Aragon's non-surrealist poetry book called Le Roman inachevé. \nThe Sri Lankan Civil War began because the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils had long-standing political disagreements. Before European colonization, the island was ruled by three separate kingdoms, with wars and peace being common between them. During colonial times by the Portuguese, Dutch, and finally the British, the kingdoms were treated as individual territories. After independence, the British combined the whole island into one administrative area. This led to tensions between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamils, who had been in conflict even before colonial times. According to Jonathan Spencer, a social scientist, the war is a result of how modern ethnic identities were formed and changed since colonial times, with political struggles, disputes over historical sites and language origins, and the manipulation of the national past all playing a role. \nFort Diu is in Diu, a place in India that's looked after by the Indian government. The Portuguese built the fort a long time ago, in 1535, when they were in charge of the island. The town of Diu is next to the fort. The fort was made stronger over time because the ruler of Gujarat and the Portuguese wanted to protect themselves from the Mughal Emperor, Humayun, who wanted to take over. The Portuguese stayed in control for a very long time, 424 years, until 1961 when India's government took action called Operation Vijay, and Diu became part of India, managed by the central government. \nL'Affiche Rouge is a song from Léo Ferré's album Les Chansons d'Aragon (1961). It was inspired by Louis Aragon's poem, Strophes pour se souvenir, written in 1955. The poem honored 23 FTP-MOI members killed by Nazis at Mont-Valérien. The event gained the name Affiche rouge because the Nazis put up red posters in Paris in 1944 to label the executed people as immigrants and Resistants. \nMwambutsa IV Bangiricenge was the king of Burundi from 1915 to 1966. He became king after his father, Mutaga IV Mbikije, passed away. Mwambutsa was born during a time when Burundi was ruled by the Germans, but most of his reign happened when Belgium was in control (1916-1962). The Belgians controlled both Rwanda and Burundi but let the local kings, like Mwambutsa, rule indirectly."}], "output": "\nJames Gordon Farrell**"},

This character wrote letters in the 1980s, expressing worries about nuclear war and the common market. These letters were gathered into collections. \nUterine cancer, also known as womb cancer, is a group of cancers that start in the uterus. The most common type worldwide is cervical cancer, which starts in the lower part of the uterus. In developing countries, it's the second most common cancer in women. Endometrial cancer, which affects the inside lining of the uterus, is the second most common in women from developed countries. Factors that can increase the risk include being overweight, older age, and having a virus called human papillomavirus. In the early stages, there might be no symptoms, but some people may experience unusual bleeding, pelvic pain, or feeling full. If caught early, most types can be treated with surgery or medicine. If the cancer has spread beyond the uterus, doctors might use a mix of treatments like chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery to help manage it. \nPetty treason, a crime under English common law, allowed subordinates to betray or murder their superiors. However, it was different from high treason, which only targeted the Sovereign. In 1828, England and Wales merged petty treason into murder with the Offences against the Person Act, while it was abolished in Ireland in 1829. Scotland never had petty treason, and it's no longer a crime in other countries that follow common law. \nIn a common law trial, a group of people called a petit jury listens to evidence from both the person bringing the case (the plaintiff) and the person defending it (the defendant). The judge gives them instructions, then they go in a room to talk and decide if the defendant is guilty or not. The number of people needed to agree on a decision depends on the place, sometimes everyone has to agree, sometimes just a majority. If they can't decide, it's called a hung jury. There are usually 12 people on the jury, but in some places it's more. In countries not following English common law, there are different jury systems. But the common law trial jury is the most common type. \nTreason is when someone is disloyal and it's a crime. In the past, there were two types: high treason, which means being disloyal to the whole country, and petty treason, which was when someone betrayed their boss, like a servant killing their master. Petty treason used to include hurting your boss, but over time, it became seen as a more serious kind of murder where the only allowed act was killing. \nThe Kegelhelm was a type of cone-shaped helmet that protected the face and sometimes had extra parts to guard the cheeks or a top piece called a crest-holder. It was made of bronze and had Greek helmet designs, like the Illyrian type. However, it was used before the year 700 BC and didn't last much longer than that. \nM Music & Musicians is a magazine based in California that talks about the music world.

Channing, born on January 7, 1868 and passing away on April 1, 1961, was a multi-talented individual. He was an outstanding football player, recognized as an All-American halfback during his time at Princeton University. In 1889, he was one of the eleven players chosen by Caspar Whitney for the first-ever College Football All-America Team. When the Spanish-American War broke out in 1898, Channing joined Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, which Roosevelt was proud to have many Ivy League football players from. After the war, Channing ventured into the mining industry and managed the Whitney family's mining operations. He later partnered with Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney in the 1920s, forming the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company in Flin Flon, Canada. Channing served as the company's President until his death in 1961. \nCornelius Vanderbilt C.V. (Sonny) Whitney was a successful American businessman, film producer, writer, generous donor, skilled polo player, and government official. He was also well-known for owning a top-notch stable of racehorses.\nEquix is a company in Lexington, Kentucky, started in 1984. They use high-speed digital tools to study how horses move and their health. They mainly help people who sell young Thoroughbred racehorses by predicting which ones will be good at racing and which ones would make good parents for future horses. This helps them choose the best horses for racing and breeding. \nIn 2010, the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) ranked Thoroughbred racehorses from the 2009 season. This list included horses aged three or older who raced in flat races in 2009, and it was open to all horses, regardless of their country of origin or training location. \nIn January 2012, the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities created the 2012 World Thoroughbred Rankings. This list evaluated the performance of Thoroughbred racehorses aged three or older who raced on flat tracks in 2011. The rankings were open to all horses, regardless of where they were from or trained. \nPalm Meadows Thoroughbred Training Center is a big place in Florida where they train racehorses. It's close to a track called Gulfstream Park and owned by Stronach Group. They spent a lot of money, $90 million, to build it in 2002. It's really big, 304 acres, and one of the best and newest training centers in the US for horse racing. \nIn 2011, there was a list called the World Thoroughbred Rankings that ranked racehorses. This list was made by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities in January. It included horses that were three years old or older and had raced in flat races in 2011. Any horse, no matter where it was from or trained, could be included on the list. \nThe 2008 World Thoroughbred Rankings was a list created by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities in January 2009 to rank Thoroughbred racehorses based on their performances in flat races worldwide in 2008. This was a significant change as it was the first time the rankings were open to all horses, regardless of where they raced or were trained. Previously, the IFHA had two separate lists: one for the Northern Hemisphere in January and another for the Southern Hemisphere in August. \nNight Raid, born in 1918 in England, was a very successful stallion in Australia that bred top-quality racehorses. Two famous horses he produced were Phar Lap and Nightmarch. \nThe paragraph is about a list of top Thoroughbred racehorses.

He was one of the pioneers in introducing Scandinavian design to the United States. He was born on May 8, 1916, and passed away on December 9, 2016. \nScandinavian design is a style that became popular in the 1950s in Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark. It's known for being simple, having minimal decorations, and being very practical. Even though the term Scandinavia usually means Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, people sometimes use it to include all five countries when talking about this design style.\nIn 2003, Charles Lim Chee Pang, the founder of Peliontech, introduced a new type of ERP software called Workflow Resource Planning (WRP) to replace traditional ERP systems. These systems typically work by entering data and processing it. Lim's innovation was to create WRP software, like Radix ERP, which includes workflow features right from the start. Although workflow systems were once popular with Lotus Notes, they fell out of favor around 2000. Lim took inspiration from Lotus Notes and combined workflow capabilities into ERP systems, resulting in a new category of ERP called Radix WRP, designed to manage workflows more effectively. \nAn NTFS symbolic link is a file in the NTFS system that points to another file or folder. It acts like a regular file or directory and can be treated the same way by users and programs. Starting with NTFS 3.0 in Windows 2000, you could create links to directories (junction points) and entire volumes (mount points). From NTFS 3.1, which came with Windows XP, symbolic links could be used for any file. However, at first, only special software (filter drivers) like Masatoshi Kimura's open-source codice_1 driver allowed users to create these links in regular programs. In Windows Vista, the ntfs.sys system allowed this feature to be used by default by regular user mode applications. \nJens Ritter Instruments is a company that makes fancy electric guitars and basses. It was started by Jens Ritter in the 1990s, and he used to just make bass guitars but added guitars later. He makes around 50 to 60 unique instruments each year in a small town called Deidesheim in Germany. Many famous bass players use his guitars, like Phil Lesh, Josh Dunham, and Doug Wimbish. Jens Ritter Instruments are special because of their cool design, looks, and because there aren't many of them. They also make strings and other stuff for musicians. \nBio-inspired robotic locomotion is a recent field that uses ideas from nature to create advanced robots. It focuses on designing machines based on biological systems, like how animals move. While biomimicry means copying nature directly, bio-inspired design learns from nature to make simpler and better technology. This has led to soft robotics, which uses flexible materials inspired by living things. Bio-inspired robots study nature's efficient mechanisms to solve engineering problems, often using parts like sensors, actuators, or special materials. The goal is to make robots that can move like animals, and this article explains different ways animals move and some examples of bio-inspired robots based on those movements. \nIn the United States, trademark law doesn't let companies protect certain parts of a product. This is because of something called the functionality doctrine. There are two types: utilitarian (useful features) and aesthetic (looks). The idea is that if new companies can't use a feature people want, the market won't be fair. Useful features are protected by patents, not trademarks, because patents cover inventions. Patented designs are assumed to serve a purpose until shown otherwise. Aesthetics, which make things look nice, are covered by copyright law, not trademarks, because they're like creative artwork. \nJackie Winsor is a Canadian-American sculptor born in Newfoundland on October 20, 1941. She became famous in the 1970s for her unique style that reacted against the simple art of minimalists. Her work is called post-minimal, anti-form, and process art. Her sculptures show a blend of minimalism and feminism, focusing on basic shapes and symmetry, but using natural materials like wood and hemp instead of industrial ones, which sets her apart from the minimalist movement. Her background plays a role in her artistic expression. \nThe principle of extensibility in software engineering and systems design is about building a flexible system that can accommodate future growth. It focuses on making it easy to add new features or modify existing ones without significantly disrupting the existing system. The goal is to minimize changes to the core code and allow for smooth enhancements. Since software often evolves over time to meet users' needs, extensibility allows developers to expand its functionality easily and reuse code efficiently. Techniques like supporting custom user routines, creating new data types, and defining markup tags help achieve this adaptability. \nAn HTML attribute helps to change or add extra features to an HTML element. It makes sure elements work properly and can do things they couldn't without it. You add an attribute by putting it in the opening tag of the HTML element."}], "output": "\nScandinavian design.**"},

Our eyes see blue when we look at light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometers. The bluer the light, the shorter its wavelength and closer it is to violet. On the other hand, longer wavelengths make blue appear more green. There's a specific shade of pure blue with a wavelength of 470 nanometers. In art and color theory, blue is considered one of the primary colors, along with red and yellow. Mixing red and blue creates violet, while blue and yellow mix to form green. In the technology world, blue is a primary color too, used in the RGB color model for computer screens and televisions to produce all the colors. \nInnocent Records was a special pop music label made by EMI's Virgin Records to work with their artists who liked pop music more. After the Spice Girls became very popular, Virgin Records wanted to focus on pop music too. They brought Hugh Goldsmith from RCA, who helped Take That become very successful, to start his own part of Virgin Records. He signed Billie Piper and Martine McCutcheon, plus some dance groups like Todd Terry. The label kept doing well until the mid-2000s, with artists like Atomic Kitten and Blue selling lots of records.\nProPhoto RGB is a special color space created by Kodak for photography. It has a very wide range of colors, almost 90% of all possible colors and all commonly seen real-world colors. It's even bigger than other wide-gamut color spaces. The choice of colors helps with color accuracy when adjusting images. However, there's a downside - about 13% of the colors are not real and can't be seen. \nThe YCoCg color model is a type that simplifies an RGB color space by turning it into three parts: Y (luma), Cg (chrominance green), and Co (chrominance orange). It's widely used in video and image compression systems like H.264, HEVC, JPEG XR, and Dirac because it's easy to calculate, gives good results during compression, and can be converted to and from RGB with fewer data requirements compared to other color models. \nA color space is a way to organize and represent colors, whether on paper or digitally. It helps ensure that colors look the same every time they're reproduced. Color spaces can be simple, like Pantone with specific colors and names, or complex, like NCS, Adobe RGB, or sRGB, which use math to describe colors. A color model is a theoretical way to describe colors as numbers, but it's not useful without a connection to a real-world color space. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two color spaces based on the RGB model. When creating a color space, people often use CIELAB or CIEXYZ, which cover all colors the human eye can perceive. \nHCL is a color space that combines features from cylindrical translations like HSL and HSV, which are similar to RGB but better for human perception in noisy environments. However, HSL and HSV don't match human perception of color brightness, while L*a*b* aligns with how we see colors, but has issues with hue accuracy, especially in blue. \nRGBA is a term that combines red, green, and blue colors along with an extra channel called alpha. It's an extension of the RGB model, which helps with blending or combining colors (called alpha compositing) using a value between 0 and 1. The alpha channel allows for more precise control over transparency. The color itself comes from any RGB color space, but the alpha channel was created by Catmull and Smith in the 1970s for this purpose. \nBrown is a color that comes from mixing different shades in various ways. In printing, it's made by combining red, black, and yellow or red, yellow, and blue. On screens, it's formed by a mix of red and green. We see brown a lot in nature, like in wood, soil, and people's hair, eyes, and skin. It's often associated with dark wood, healthy soil, but also with simple things like rustic materials, poop, and being poor. Many people in Europe and the US don't like the color brown the most. \nThe RGB color model is a way to create many colors by adding red, green, and blue light. These three colors, which are called primary, work together to make a wide range of hues. That's why it's called RGB. \nAn RGB color space is a system that uses red, green, and blue colors to create other colors. Each RGB color space has specific colors for red, green, and blue, and together they form a triangle of possible colors. To fully describe an RGB color space, you also need to mention the color of white and a curve called gamma correction. As of 2007, sRGB is the most commonly used RGB color space."}], "output": "\nBlue.**"},

The film takes her on a pretend journey from Waltham Abbey where Harold is buried, all the way to the area where the Battle of Hastings and William the Conqueror's invasion of England in 1066 took place.

One example is a play called Harold written by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1876, and a novel named Last of the Saxon Kings by Edward Bulwer-Lytton in 1848. Rudyard Kipling even wrote a short story in his 1910 collection called Rewards and Fairies. In this story, an old King Harold meets Henry I and passes away while held by a Saxon knight. \nThe Last English King (1997), written by Julian Rathbone, is a historical novel set during the Battle of Hastings. It follows the life of Walt Edwinson, a housecarl of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king. The story begins with Walt returning to his home in Iwerne, Dorset, four years after the battle. He had left England after the Saxons lost and traveled across Europe and Asia Minor. The novel alternates between describing Walt's journey from cities like Constantinople, Nicomedia, Nicaea, and Side, and his memories of events leading up to the battle, including accompanying Harold to William of Normandy's attack on Dinan. \nLeofwine Godwinson was a sibling of King Harold Godwinson. He was the fifth child and younger brother of Earl Godwin.

The fight was intense, and both Hardrada and Tostig died, along with most of their soldiers. Although Harold won at Stamford Bridge, he lost to the Normans in the Battle of Hastings just a few weeks later. People often say this battle marked the end of the Viking Age, but Vikings continued to attack Britain and Ireland for some time after, like Denmark's King Sweyn Estrithson and Norway's King Magnus Barefoot. \nGytha Thorkelsdóttir, also known as Githa, was a Danish noblewoman who lived from 997 to around 1069.

It has three big branches called North Fork, Middle Fork, and South Fork. These together form a big water system that carries water from parts of northeastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia, and northwestern North Carolina. When the Holston River meets the French Broad River in Knoxville, it becomes the beginning of the Tennessee River. \nA longhunter was a type of explorer and hunter from the 18th century who would venture into the wilderness of America for up to six months at a time. They were unique to Southwest Virginia and mainly started their expeditions from the Holston River Valley near Chilhowie, Virginia, or the Clinch River valley. These hunters were typically landowners or residents in the area. They usually began their hunts in October and concluded by March or April. The groups were usually small, consisting of two or three men, although occasionally there were more.\nThe Thái Bình river, also known as Sông Thái Bình, is the main river in Northern Vietnam. It, along with the Red River system, contributes to the formation of the Red River Delta by depositing alluvial soil. \nThe blackback barb is a type of fish from Africa that lives in shallow water with plants near the Zambezi, Cunene, and Zambian part of the Congo rivers. These fish can grow up to 7 centimeters long. \nThe Red River system in North Vietnam has several rivers that flow into or get water from the main Red River. When the Red River combines with the Thái Bình river system in the northeast, they create the second-largest delta in Vietnam called the Red River Delta. People often call these two systems the Red and Thái Bình rivers together. The Red River's sediment builds up the central and southern part of the delta, and big dykes protect the river banks. \nThe Cotter River System (CRS) in Namadgi National Park, Australia, was built in 1912. It's an important source of water for the Australian Capital Territory, along with the Queanbeyan River in New South Wales. However, because of recent droughts, the Cotter River System has become a bigger and more reliable source compared to the Queanbeyan River. \nThe Zambezi River System Action Plan (ZACPLAN) is a big plan by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) to work together on using and taking care of the Zambezi River, which flows through eight countries: Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. These countries all rely on the river for their water needs. The plan was made because the river is very big and they think the need for water will grow in the future. If they don't manage it well, everyone might not get enough water or use it wisely, which is not good for their countries' businesses. \nThe Pearl River, also called Zhujiang and sometimes Canton River, is a big river system in southern China. It includes the Xi, Bei, and Dong rivers in Guangdong, which all join together to form the Pearl River Delta. If you measure from the farthest part of the Xi River, it's the third-longest river in China, after the Yangtze and Yellow rivers, and the second biggest by how much water it holds. The river and its tributaries cover a wide area in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces in China. It even flows into parts of northern Vietnam's Cao Bằng and Lạng Sơn provinces. \nThe Red River Delta in Vietnam has two main river systems: the Thái Bình river system and the Red River system. The Thái Bình river system has 8 rivers that flow through northern Vietnam, and when these rivers combine with the Red River system, they create the famous Red River Delta. \nThe Eastern freshwater cod, another name for Clarence River cod, is a big fish that hunts in the rivers of northeastern New South Wales, specifically the coastal Clarence River area.

The title became extinct in 1998 when the ninth Earl, the son of the eighth Earl, passed away. \nThe Canadian federal election in 1926 took place on September 14 to choose members for the 16th Parliament of Canada. This election happened because of an issue called the King-Byng Affair. In the previous election, William Lyon Mackenzie King's Liberal Party didn't win as many seats as Arthur Meighen's Liberal-Conservatives. Despite this, Mackenzie King wanted to stay in power with the help of the Progressive Party. Together, the Liberal and Progressive groups had enough seats to let Mackenzie King lead a minority government. \nProper Boulanger, a Canadian politician and businessman, was born on November 17, 1918, and passed away on December 5, 2002.

He was a member of the Republican party. Reagan's presidency ended on January 20, 1989, and he passed the presidency to his vice president, George H. W. Bush, who won the election in 1988 with Reagan's support. \nGeorge H. W. Bush, born on June 12, 1924, is a former American president, serving from 1989 to 1993, and a previous vice president from 1981 to 1989.

This was a special inauguration because it took place on the west side of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. for the very first time. George H. W. Bush was sworn in as Vice President at the same event. Ronald Reagan took the oath of office with his mother's Bible, which he had brought with him, and Associate Justice Potter Stewart helped administer the vice presidential oath to Bush. \nRonald Reagan was sworn in for his second term as President of the United States on January 20, 1985, first in a private ceremony at the White House, and then again publicly the next day at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.

This led to around 400 soldiers being captured by the British. While trying to retreat, they were attacked by a group of British soldiers. Despite fighting bravely, Colonel Mathews got hurt and the regiment had to surrender near Kelly's Hill. They joined the 1st Virginia Regiment on May 12, 1779, and became known as the 1st Virginia Regiment. Unfortunately, the unit was captured by the British at the Siege of Charleston in May 1780 and was disbanded in November 1783. \nThe 1st Virginia State Regiment was a group of soldiers from Virginia who fought in the American Revolutionary War. They were created by the state government in December 1776 to protect Virginia. In 1777, Virginia had trouble providing enough soldiers for the main army, so the 1st Regiment, led by Colonel George Gibson, went to help in the Philadelphia area. In January 1778, they were chosen to stay in the Continental Army instead of the Ninth Regiment, which had been captured. The 1st Regiment stayed with the main army, living in places like Valley Forge and Middlebrook, and fought in the Battle of Monmouth. They stayed until late 1779 when they were sent back to Virginia.

In January 1777, it became part of the Connecticut Line and kept its original name, the 6th Connecticut. This regiment participated in significant battles like the siege of Boston, Battle of Long Island, New York Campaign, and had a light infantry unit that fought at Stony Point. Finally, on January 1, 1783, it merged with the 1st Connecticut Regiment at West Point and was officially disbanded on November 16, 1783. \nThe 3rd Virginia Regiment was created in Alexandria, Virginia, in December 1775 to fight for the Continental Army. Initially, Colonel Hugh Mercer led the group, who later became a brigadier general. George Weedon took over and also became a brigadier general after a short time. Colonel Thomas Marshall, John Marshall's father, commanded the regiment later during its stay at Valley Forge. They participated in significant battles like New York Campaign, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Charleston Siege. Unfortunately, most of the regiment was captured by the British in South Carolina on May 12, 1780, and officially disbanded on November 15, 1783.

Some people think Hlín might be another name for Frigg. \nNorse mythology is the ancient stories and beliefs of the people who lived in Northern Europe before and after they started following Christianity. These stories include gods, creatures, and heroes, which come from old books, things found in ancient sites, and the folk tales passed down through generations.\nThe Frigg gas field is a natural gas area in the North Sea, near the border between the United Kingdom and Norway. It's named after the goddess Frigg. Norway's King Olav V started production on May 8, 1978, but they stopped on October 26, 2004. The field is about 230 kilometers west of a city called Stavanger. Initially, Elf Aquitaine, a French oil company, managed the field, but it later changed its name to Total S.A. \nEir is a goddess in Norse mythology who is connected with medical knowledge and healing. She is mentioned in three sources: an old collection called the Poetic Edda, a book written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, and a runic inscription from Norway around the same time. People study if these sources talk about the same Eir and wonder if she started as a healer or a battle选女. Some also think she might be related to Frigg and similar to the Greek goddess Hygieia. \nSága is a goddess from Norse mythology who is linked to wisdom. She hangs out at a place called Sökkvabekkr, where she enjoys drinks with the god Odin by a cool water source. Both Sága and Sökkvabekkr are found in ancient stories written around the 13th century. Some experts think that Sökkvabekkr might be related to Frigg's underwater home, Fensalir, and maybe Sága is another name for Frigg. \nNanna Nepsdóttir is a goddess in Norse mythology connected to the god Baldr. She is his wife and together they have a son named Forseti. When Baldr dies, Nanna is so heartbroken that she dies too. They are both placed on a ship and set on fire, eventually reaching the underworld, Hel, where they reunited. To try to revive Baldr, a god named Hermóðr goes to Hel and gets help from Hel herself. As a result, Nanna gives Hermóðr gifts like a linen robe and a finger-ring for Frigg and Fulla, among others. Nanna is often mentioned in ancient poems, and there's a mention of a Nanna in an older collection of poems called the Poetic Edda. \nGná is a goddess in Norse mythology who helps Frigg with tasks by traveling between different worlds. She rides on a magical horse named Hófvarpnir, which can fly and walk on water. Hófvarpnir and Sleipnir, another famous horse, are special because they can do things beyond normal horses. The goddess Gná and her horse are mentioned in a book called the Prose Edda written a long time ago by Snorri Sturluson. Some people also think Gná might be related to a Roman goddess named Fama. \nFrigg, the goddess in Norse mythology, resides in a place called Fensalir, which is mentioned in two ancient texts: the Poetic Edda from around the 13th century and the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson, also from that time. Researchers have suggested that Fensalir might be related to ancient Norse beliefs about springs, bogs, or swamps, and it could be connected to another watery place linked to the goddess Sága, called Sökkvabekkr. \nMarzanna, also known by various names like Марена, Morė, Morana, and Morena, is a goddess from Baltic and Slavic cultures. She represents the cycle of life, symbolizing the death and rebirth of nature during winter. This transformation is connected to the arrival of spring, as she is replaced by goddesses like Kostroma, Lada, or Vesna in Slavic traditions. Marzanna is also associated with dreams and the end of winter. \nIn Germanic mythology, there is a goddess named Fulla (Old Norse for bountiful or Volla in Old High German). She is often depicted as wearing a golden band and taking care of Frigg's special things, like her ashen box and shoes. Frigg even trusts Fulla with her secrets. Fulla is mentioned in ancient stories and poems from the 13th century, like the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson. There's also a mention of Volla in a 10th-century Old High German text, where she helps heal a horse in a magical way and is said to be Frigg's sister. People studying these myths have tried to understand the deeper meaning behind the goddess."}], "output": "\nFrigg's tales consist of stories from Norse mythology, including her connection to the goddess Hlín, who is mentioned in the Poetic Edda, and the possibility that Hlín or Sága might be alternative names for Frigg. These tales also involve her underwater home, Fensalir, and the other gods and goddesses who interact with her, such as Eir, Nanna Nepsdóttir, and Gná."},

But, by looking at trace fossils and clues from injuries, we can guess how dinosaurs behaved. Scientists use body positions, where they lived, computer models, and what other animals do today to understand dinosaur behavior. While there's still much guessing, we know that some behaviors like living relatives' were common. Dinosaurs often hung out together for safety, maybe to travel or take care of their young. Fossilized nests and eggs show they cared for their babies, and some dinosaurs had fancy headgear that might have been for showing off or fighting. Dinosaurs mostly walked on land, and studying how they moved helps us picture their daily life.

It was first published in 1957 and provides an insightful look into the French Enlightenment era as well. \nGabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, also known as Marquise Du Châtelet, was a French philosopher, mathematician, physicist, and writer in the early 1730s. Sadly, she died giving birth in 1749. She is best known for translating and explaining Isaac Newton's famous book, Principia, which has the basic laws of physics. Her translation, published after her death in 1759, is still the main French version used today. She also made a significant contribution to Newtonian mechanics by suggesting that there's a rule about energy conservation, with moving things having kinetic energy as part of it.\nKatherine Kath, a French ballet dancer who performed at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, had to stop dancing after a serious injury.

They cover important things like how the government is made, how different groups work together, and the rights of people living there. These laws are like a kind of pretend constitution, but Israel hasn't finished making a real one yet. Instead, they use these laws and other rules to run the country. The Basic Laws don't cover everything, and sometimes it's hard to know if they're more important than regular laws. There's no timeline for finishing the process of making a complete constitution. \nIsrael doesn't have a formal written constitution. Instead, they have a set of important laws called Basic Laws that help organize the government and protect human rights.

Her initial appointment was temporary and would end after 30 days if the Virginia General Assembly didn't elect her for a full 12-year term. In August, they met but couldn't decide, causing confusion about whether the session was still ongoing. The governor claimed the legislature wasn't in session and reappointed her, but it's unclear if this was allowed. Her second term would have ended on February 12 if they didn't elect her permanently by then. \nThis paragraph explains the history of elections in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Until 1923, mayors were elected every year, but then it changed to a two-year term. Since 1971, the mayoral term has been three years. Before 1914, councillors and aldermen were elected annually, but their terms switched to two-year cycles with half of them up for election each year. In 1971, aldermanic elections aligned with mayoral ones and had three-year terms. The city expanded to 14 wards in 1976, with one alderman per ward. In 2010, the term councillor replaced alderman. Finally, in 2012, the mayor and councillor terms were extended to four years. \nJoseph Vitale is a Democrat who has been a part of the New Jersey State Senate since 1998.

This band is particularly important because it marked the beginning of Björk Guðmundsdóttir's music career, who later became a famous singer. \nINXS was an Australian rock band formed in 1977 in Sydney. They started by playing covers in clubs, occasionally playing their own music. The group had key members like Andrew (composer and keyboardist), Jon (drummer), Tim and Kirk (guitarists), Garry (bassist), and Michael (lead singer with a great look and stage presence). They started with a pop style but later evolved into a mix of pub rock, funk, and dance music. For 20 years, Michael Hutchence was the face of the band.\nThe debut EP of the Icelandic punk-pop band Tappi Tíkarrass, titled Bitið fast í vitið (translated as Bite Hard In Your Mind), was released in late 1982 on Spor label. This happened just a year after the band's formation in September 1981, with Björk and Eyþór Arnalds as lead vocalists. This EP showcases the band's punk side and includes five songs, with one of them being an English track titled London. \nSteeltown was an Australian band from Brisbane that played music in the 90s, mixing synth, rock, and pop. They became very popular, especially with their song 'Hero' released in September 1991. They sold a lot of their music, more than any other band from Queensland. You can watch their music videos and live performances on YouTube. The band members included Andy Richmond on vocals, Peter Howard on keyboards, Terry Gidman on drums, Kate Richmond (Andy's sister) on vocals and percussion, and Reece Speceis on lead guitar. Steeltown formed when some members of a Scottish band called the Technicians, who had also done well with hits like 'Hot for Love', 'Clockwork Clown', and 'Sodier of Fortune', moved to Australia in the 80s. The Technicians were signed to record labels like Powderworks, EMI, and BMG, and their music was published by MMA, which was owned by the famous band INXS. \nNýtt Líf, a comedy film from Iceland, was directed by Þráinn Bertelsson and came out in 1983. It was filmed on the Westman Islands and had famous actors like Eggert Þorleifsson and Karl Ágúst Úlfsson. The movie also had music by Tappi Tíkarrass, a band Björk was part of, who sang songs like Sperglar and Kukl (also known as Seiður). \nDisco polo is a type of dance music that originated in Poland in the late 1980s, initially called sidewalks music. It became popular in the mid-1990s, especially around 1995-1997, but its popularity declined later. In the early 2000s, it almost disappeared, but then it made a comeback in late 2007. According to the Polish Language Dictionary by PWN, disco polo is a Polish version of disco with simple tunes. It combines elements of disco, Euro disco, folk music influenced by Italo disco, and even Polish folk songs often played at weddings and celebrations. \nKidandali is a special type of music from Uganda, like the other local one called Kadongo Kamu. It comes from the Ganda language, meaning a fun celebration or party. You can hear this music at concerts or traditional weddings called kwanjula. People sometimes call it Band music or Afrobeat too. It's the music you usually enjoy at those local events. \nRave music can mean different things. It originally referred to popular dance styles like house, breakbeat, acid house, techno, and hardcore techno from the late 1980s and early 1990s. These were the first tunes played at raves. Rave music also includes other electronic dance music (EDM) you might hear at a party nowadays.\n\nRave as a genre started in the UK during the 1980s, especially at secret parties and on pirate radio. It evolved into different forms like oldschool hardcore, which gave birth to new styles like drum and bass, 2-step, and harder subgenres like gabber, hardstyle, and happy hardcore. At raves, you usually hear DJ mix sets, but sometimes live performances are also featured. \nFolk rock is a mix of folk and rock music. It started in the 1960s in the US and UK. Bands like the Beatles, Bob Dylan, and the Byrds used guitars from rock music to play folk songs. In June 1965, music writers in the US first called this style folk rock when they talked about the Byrds, whose first album came out that month. \nThe Icelandic punk band Tappi Tíkarrass released their only album called Miranda on December 23, 1983, through Gramm Records."}], "output": "\nPunk, rock, funk, and jazz.**"},

It's part of a system in our body that some medicines target to lower blood pressure. Angiotensin also makes another hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone helps the kidneys hold onto more sodium, which contributes to higher blood pressure. \nAldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that helps the body keep sodium and balance potassium levels. It's important for maintaining blood pressure and water balance. When it doesn't work properly, it can cause health problems like heart and kidney issues. It works differently from a hormone called atrial natriuretic hormone, which does the opposite.\nThe sodium-chloride symporter, also called NCC or NCCT, is a special protein in our kidneys that helps take in sodium and chloride from the tubular fluid into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule. This protein belongs to a group called SLC12 cotransporters. In humans, our body has this protein from a gene called SLC12A3, which is found on chromosome 16q13. \nThe loop of Henle is a part of a kidney called a nephron. It starts from the first part of the nephron called the proximal convoluted tubule and goes to the second part, the distal convoluted tubule. A German scientist named Friedrich Henle found this loop. Its main job is to help make a special concentration in the middle part of the kidney called the medulla. \nLow pressure receptors, also known as volume receptors, are found in specific parts of the veins, lungs, and heart. They sense changes in the pressure of the blood vessels when they're not full (less than 60mmHg). These receptors help control the release of hormones like antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin, and aldosterone. When the pressure in the upper heart chamber (atrium) is high, these hormones are released less. This leads to more urine being produced, which helps lower blood pressure. At the same time, stretching of the atrial receptors triggers the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which encourages the body to remove more water and salt through urine. \nRenal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a health issue where the body has too much acid because the kidneys can't make the urine as acidic as it should be. When blood goes through the kidneys, it filters out waste and exchanges important things like salts and acids. In RTA, the kidneys either don't absorb enough alkaline bicarbonate ions early on (in the proximal tubule) or don't release enough acidic hydrogen ions later on (in the distal tubule). This leads to a problem called metabolic acidosis. RTA is for people whose kidneys work fine but have trouble with urine acidity. There are different types of RTA, each with its own set of symptoms and causes. \nThe ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney is located after the loop's sharp turn, following the descending limb. It has two parts: a thin and a thick section, with the thick part also called the distal straight tubule, which comes before the distal convoluted tubule. \nTubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) is a system in the kidneys that helps regulate how well the glomerulus filters blood. When there's too much sodium chloride in the kidney's tubules, cells called macula densa release a substance called adenosine. This starts a chain reaction that adjusts the glomerular filtration rate to a healthy level. It's one way the kidneys keep things in balance. \nSylvia Agnes Sophia Tait, born on January 8, 1917, and passed away on February 28, 2003, was an English biochemist and endocrinologist. She is best known for her collaboration with her husband, James Francis Tait, from 1948 until her death. They made significant contributions to science by discovering aldosterone, a hormone crucial for regulating blood pressure. This hormone helps conserve sodium, release potassium, maintain water balance, and elevate blood pressure. It is believed to cause about 15% of high blood pressure cases. Their partnership was considered one of the most successful in husband-wife scientific collaboration, as mentioned in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. \nDistal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is the first type of kidney problem where the body has trouble making enough acid in the urine. This happens because the cells in the kidney that should make acid aren't working properly. This can be caused by different things and results in urine that isn't as acidic as it should be, usually not getting below a pH of 5.3."}], "output": "\nThe adrenal gland.**"},

During these elections, people will vote to choose new members for the House of Representatives (435 seats) and part of the Senate (33 seats). Additionally, there will be elections for state governors, as well as other state and local leaders. \nNancy Soderberg is an American foreign policy expert who has worked with President Bill Clinton and served as a UN ambassador. She currently runs her own company, teaches at the University of North Florida, and was a board member for various organizations. She has advised politicians, written books on foreign policy, and frequently appears on TV and radio. In 2017, she announced her intention to run for Congress as a Democrat in Florida's 6th district in the 2018 elections. She holds a Master's from Georgetown and a Bachelor's from Vanderbilt.\nThe Wisconsin general elections in 2016 took place on November 8th in the state of Wisconsin. During these elections, people voted to choose new members for one Senate seat, eight House of Representatives seats, half of the Senate seats, and all the Assembly seats. Prior to the main election, there were primary elections held on August 9th. \nMidterm elections in the US happen every four years, halfway through the president's term. These elections decide who gets to be in Congress, including all 435 House seats and a few Senate seats. \nThe United States Senate has three groups, each with 33 or 34 seats. These groups help decide when elections will happen. They're set up so that every two years, one group's seats are up for election, instead of all 100 at once. In 2012, Class 1 seats were chosen, Class 2 in 2014, and Class 3 in 2016. \nIn 2007, an alliance called TEAM Unity was formed by supporters and some former critics of former Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. They joined forces to help her in the elections. The main goal was to keep President Arroyo from being impeached by her political opponents after the elections, by gaining Senate seats. \nThe 80th Congress of the United States, which took place from 1947 to 1949, was a time when the Senate and House of Representatives worked together to make laws. It happened during Harry Truman's presidency. The number of representatives in the House was decided based on the people counted in 1940. Republicans became the majority in both parts of Congress, but they didn't do much, so Truman called them the Do Nothing Congress. He even used that against them in the 1948 election. They did pass some pro-business laws like the Taft-Hartley Act, but they didn't support Truman's plans. In the election, Truman's plan worked, and Republicans lost seats, giving Democrats more power in the 81st Congress. \nDuring George W. Bush's first term as a Republican president in the United States, the 2002 elections took place on November 5. Surprisingly, during midterm elections, his party actually gained seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. They won 2 Senate seats and 8 House seats. \nOn November 4, 2008, people voted for new members of the United States Senate. Out of 100 seats, 35 were being chosen. Normally, 33 seats would have new people for a 6-year term from January 3, 2009 to January 3, 2015. Two special elections happened too, in Mississippi and Wyoming. Since those seats were for Class 1, the winners would finish the rest of the terms that ended in January 2013. \nIn the 2002 United States Senate elections, Republicans won two important seats from Democrats, giving them a small majority. These elections were especially tough and happened after the September 11 attacks in 2001, which took place about fourteen months before the election on November 5, 2002.

Thompkins and Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan which one was a  case decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court of the United States? \n\n Passage: \nIn 1982, the Supreme Court of the United States made a decision in a case called Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan. They ruled that the University's policy of only admitting one gender was against the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. The decision was close, with the court voting 5-4. \nIn the 2010 case Berghuis v. Thompkins (docket 08-1470), the US Supreme Court examined a situation where a person knows they have the right to remain silent because of Miranda v. Arizona, but doesn't say it out loud or give up that right.\nThe Hoffman v. Jones case, decided by the Florida Supreme Court in 1973, marked the first time the comparative negligence rule was introduced in negligence law through a court ruling instead of a law. Lawyer Sammy Cacciatore Jr. played a significant role in this change. The case involved the death of William Harrison Jones Jr., who was hit by a truck driven by Philip Francis Hoffman Jr. This was the first instance where a state's highest court in the US abandoned the old rule of contributory negligence, which prevented injured people from receiving compensation if they were partly responsible. The court adopted pure comparative negligence, where victims can still be compensated based on the percentage of fault by the defendant. This decision has had a lasting impact, being included in law school textbooks and now being the standard rule in negligence cases. \nThe first case the United States Supreme Court heard was Van Staphorst v. Maryland in 1791. However, it was resolved before the oral arguments. The first appellate case they took on was Collet v. Collet, and they gave their first decision in West v. Barnes. \nIn a big court decision called Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt in 2016, the United States Supreme Court said that Texas can't make rules that make it too hard for women to get abortions. They said these rules should not cause problems for women. The same day, the court decided not to look at similar cases from Wisconsin and Mississippi where other judges had already said those rules were not okay. This might affect other states with similar laws too. \nThe US Supreme Court ruled in 1943 that during wartime, it was okay for the government to put curfews on people from a certain minority group, like Japanese Americans, if their country was at war with the US. This happened after the Pearl Harbor attack and the US entered World War II. President Roosevelt allowed military leaders to restrict certain areas and Japanese Americans had to follow a curfew and other rules before being sent to internment camps. Gordon Hirabayashi was put on trial for breaking the curfew and appealed to the Supreme Court. Another case, Yasui v. United States, was also decided that day. Both convictions were later overturned in 1980. \nIn simple terms, Commissioner v. Banks (2005) and another case dealt with whether money a person wins in a lawsuit and pays their lawyer as part of a deal where the lawyer only gets paid if they win, counts as taxable income for the person. The Supreme Court said yes, it does. But there's a special rule for when the lawsuit is about employment and a law from 2004 lets people not count those lawyer fees as income. This law changed a rule in the IRS about how to calculate income after taking out lawyer fees. \nIn the 2009 Supreme Court case Summers v. Earth Island Institute, a group of environmental organizations fought the United States Forest Service (USFS). They wanted to stop the agency from quickly selling timber from 238 acres of burned federal land without following proper steps, like giving people a chance to share their opinions and appeal the decision, as required by a law called the Forest Service Decision-making and Appeals Reform Act. The ruling was 5-4 in favor of the organizations. \nThe Supreme Court case of United States v. Quiver, decided in 1916, involved an adultery incident on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Two members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe were involved. The court initially ruled that the act wasn't punishable under an 1887 law because the reservation wasn't under the district court's authority. The Supreme Court agreed, stating that the adultery, committed by two Native Americans on a Native American reservation, wasn't a crime according to the law. \nIn 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States made a decision about same-sex couples' adoption rights in a case called V.L. v. E.L. In 2007, a court in Georgia let E.L.'s partner, V.L., adopt their three kids. But after they moved to Alabama and split, E.L. didn't want V.L to see the children. V.L. went to court to ask for visitation rights. The Alabama Supreme Court said they didn't have to honor the Georgia adoption. V.L. asked the US Supreme Court to let her see her kids while she appealed. On December 14, 2015, the US Supreme Court put the Alabama court's decision on hold. Then, on March 7, 2016, they overturned the Alabama court's decision without giving a detailed explanation."}], "output": "\nMississippi University for Women v. Hogan.**"},

RCA Records released it. Half of the album was made by Stock Aitken & Waterman, and the other half had Astley's own songs produced by friends like Phil Harding, Ian Curnow, and Daize Washbourn. There was a problem because a fire at PWL Studios burned some of Astley's music, so the album was late.

He came back in 1991 with a soul album called Free. \nBoy Next Door is the fifth and final single by British R&B singer Jamelia, taken from her first album called Drama.

But, it does include her version of Stop for the first time on a Jamelia album. \nFire! is a shoujo manga by Hideko Mizuno about an American rock star named Aaron. It was popular from 1969-1971 and won an award. Aaron was unique because he wasn't your typical nice guy or perfect prince. His rebellious behavior, especially his sexually explicit scenes, which were new for post-war manga, attracted fans. The story might seem like a moral lesson, but many teenagers followed Aaron's adventures eagerly, even lining up to get the next issue. \nMeg Cabot's 2004 book, Boy Meets Girl, is a chick lit novel that was first published under her pseudonym, Meggin Cabot. It's part of the Boy series but doesn't have a strong connection to the first book, The Boy Next Door. HarperCollins Publishers released it in January 2004, and later editions credited Meg Cabot."}], "output": "\nStacey Kent.**"},

The plane, a Boeing 707-436, was being flown by Captain Bernard Dobson, a 45-year-old pilot from Dorset with lots of experience flying these jets since November 1960. Unfortunately, the flight crashed due to a sudden and severe turbulence in the sky near Mount Fuji in Japan. \nThe Boeing 707 is a popular mid-sized airplane that flew long distances and had a narrow body. It had four engines and was made by Boeing from 1958 to 1979. People usually say seven oh seven when talking about it. Different versions of the plane could carry between 140 and 219 passengers and travel up to 2500 miles.\nOn April 8, 1968, a British Airways flight called BOAC 712, which was traveling from London to Sydney via Zurich and Singapore on a Boeing 707 plane, had a serious engine problem during takeoff. The engine caught fire and even detached from the plane. The plane managed to land safely, but unfortunately, five people died due to confusion during the emergency procedures and the distraction of a safety inspector being on board. \nThe Silver Shadow cruise ship started operating in the year 2000 and is run by Silversea Cruises. It can carry 382 passengers and has 295 crew members. Built by Mariotti Shipyard in Italy, both the Silver Shadow and its sister ship, Silver Whisper, offer exceptional space with a high ratio of 74 square meters per passenger, making them stand out among other cruise ships. They also have a great crew-to-passenger ratio of 1.31 to 1. \nThe Silver Whisper cruise ship, launched in 2000 and run by Silversea Cruises, can accommodate 382 passengers and has a crew of 295. Built by Mariotti Shipyard in Italy, these ships are known for their exceptional space, with a high space-to-passenger ratio of 74. This means each passenger gets more room than on any other cruise ship. Additionally, they boast a low crew-to-passenger ratio of 1.31 to 1, ensuring a more personalized experience. \nDuring World War II, there was a special flight called Ball-bearing Run. It flew between Stockholm, Sweden, and Leuchars, Scotland. Even though the Royal Norwegian Air Force was in charge, the flight pretended to be a regular BOAC flight. The planes looked like they belonged to BOAC, the crew wore BOAC uniforms, and even had British passports to hide their true military purpose. \nOn June 1, 1943, a BOAC flight from Lisbon, Portugal, to Bristol, England, called 777-A, was unfortunately targeted by eight German planes (Junkers Ju 88s) during the journey. The plane crashed into the Bay of Biscay, sadly claiming the lives of all 17 people on board, including famous actor Leslie Howard. \nRoyal Caribbean International has three cruise ships called Freedom class. The first one, Freedom of the Seas, was the biggest passenger ship in the world when it was built in 2006, both in terms of how many people it could carry and its size. But in 2009, the Oasis of the Seas was built and it became even bigger, breaking the records that Freedom of the Seas had set. \nMV Caledonian Isles is a big ship owned by Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited and is operated by Caledonian MacBrayne (CalMac). CalMac uses this ship to transport people and cars to the Hebridean and Clyde Islands in Scotland, specifically to the Isle of Arran via the Ardrossan to Brodick route. Since it's a very busy route, Caledonian Isles can hold up to 1000 passengers and 110 cars and the crossing takes only 55 minutes. During summer, many day-trippers use this ship to visit the Isle of Arran. \nKenneth Stonehouse, a British journalist who worked for Reuters in the US and Europe, tragically died when his plane, BOAC Flight 777, was shot down. He was born on May 10, 1908, and passed away on June 1, 1943."}], "output": "\n219 passengers.**"},

They were together for 20 years when he was still the Duke of Clarence. They had ten children who were not married, and they all took the name FitzClarence. \nElizabeth Hay, also known as Elizabeth FitzClarence, was born on January 17, 1801, and was the love child of King William IV and Dorothea Jordan. At the age of 19, she married William Hay, who became the 18th Earl of Erroll after their marriage on December 4, 1820. As a result of her connection, William Hay received the title of Lord Steward of the Household. They tied the knot at St George's, Hanover Square. Elizabeth treasured a portrait of her FitzClarence family at House of Dun and kept a stone and gloves from her father's first Parliament as keepsakes. Sadly, she passed away in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nAmelia Cary, Viscountess Falkland was a British noblewoman born on March 21, 1807. She was the fifth child, but not legally recognized, of King William IV, who was then Duke of Clarence, and his mistress Dorothea Jordan. Amelia had four sisters and five brothers who also had the last name FitzClarence. After their father became king, they were acknowledged and considered part of a marquess's family. She was named after her aunt, Princess Amelia, who was a granddaughter of King George III. Unfortunately, Amelia passed away on July 2, 1858. \nJohn Crichton-Stuart, the 5th Marquess of Bute, was born on August 4, 1907, and passed away on August 14, 1956. He was the son of John Crichton-Stuart, the 4th Marquess of Bute, and Augusta Bellingham. On his father's side, he had a unique connection to history, as he was related to Robert II of Scotland through an illegitimate son named John Stewart. On his mother's side, he traced his lineage to William IV of the United Kingdom, through one of his mistress Dorothea Jordan's children, Elizabeth Hay, Countess of Erroll. This made the 5th Marquess the first Bute family member with a direct connection to King William IV. \nLady Mary Fox, born on December 19, 1798, and passed away on July 13, 1864, was a writer. She had an unusual background because she was not the legal child of King William IV of the United Kingdom; instead, she was his child from a relationship with Dorothea Jordan. \nLieutenant-General Lord Frederick FitzClarence was a British Army officer. He was born on December 9, 1799, and unfortunately passed away on October 30, 1854. What's interesting is that he was not the king's legal son; he was the third child from King William IV and his secret lover, Dorothea Jordan. \nLady Augusta Gordon was a British noblewoman who was born on November 17, 1803, to William IV, who later became the King of the United Kingdom, and his mistress Dorothea Jordan. She lived with her siblings at their family home, Bushy House, in Teddington. Augusta and her siblings were given the title of younger children of a marquess after their father became the king. \nSophia Sidney, also known as Baroness De L'Isle and Dudley, was born on March 4, 1795. She was the oldest child from King William IV and his long-time lover Dorothea Jordan. She had a marriage with Philip Sidney, and together they had four kids. In her last years, she worked as the State Housekeeper at Kensington Palace before passing away on April 10, 1837. \nThe Regency Act of 1830 was a law made by the UK Parliament to plan for a situation where King William IV could pass away before his underage successor became the new ruler. The law allowed for a regency period until the new monarch turned 18, and even mentioned a possibility of a child from King William's family taking the throne after him. But since William didn't have a living legitimate child, and Queen Victoria became queen when she was 18 in 1837, the Act was never needed. \nWilhelmina FitzClarence, who was called Mina, was a British noblewoman and author. She was born on June 27, 1830, just a day after her mother, Lady Augusta FitzClarence, who was an illegitimate daughter of King William IV. Mina grew up traveling around Europe and visiting important courts like France and Hanover. In 1855, she married her first cousin, William FitzClarence, who became the 2nd Earl of Munster. Together, they had nine children, including the 3rd and 4th Earls of Munster."}], "output": "\nJanuary 17, 1801.**"}]

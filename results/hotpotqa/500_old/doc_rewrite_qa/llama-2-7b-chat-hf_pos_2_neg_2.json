The remote was originally designed to control the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5, and it's compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers. The Apple Remote was the primary control mechanism for the first three generations of Apple TV. However, it has since been replaced by the Siri Remote in the fourth generation. Before the Apple Remote, Apple made several anonymous IR remotes for products like the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive. Front Row was a software application for Mac computers and Apple TV that allowed users to navigate and play videos, photos, podcasts, and music through a user-friendly interface. It was similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi and worked by using iTunes and iPhoto. The software could be controlled using an Apple Remote or keyboard function keys. Front Row was first released in October 2005 and had two major updates since. However, Apple removed and discontinued Front Row in Mac OS X 10.7.A universal remote is a remote control that can work with different brands and types of consumer electronics devices. Some universal remotes can only control a limited number of devices, while others allow you to add new device codes to the remote. Many remotes that come with electronic devices, like TVs or DVD players, also have universal remote capabilities, which means you can use them to control other devices too. For example, you can program a VCR remote to work with different brands of TVs. In simple terms, a remote control is a device that allows you to control another electronic device from a distance. For example, you might use a remote control to turn on your TV, DVD player, or other home appliances without having to get up from your couch. Remote controls are super convenient because they allow you to operate devices that are out of reach, like a garage door opener or a projector that's mounted high on a ceiling. So, you can easily control your devices without having to physically touch them."}], "output": "  According to the passage, the Apple Remote can control the following devices aside from the Apple Remote itself:\n\n* Macintosh TV\n* TV tuner expansion boards\n* PowerCD drive\n* Consumer electronics devices (through a universal remote)\n\nSo, the answer is: Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, PowerCD drive, and consumer electronics devices. **"},

The company was founded by Henry J. Kaiser in the 1940s to supply steel plates to the shipbuilding industry on the Pacific coast, which expanded during World War II, then contracted, and then grew again during the Korean War. One of the shipyards Kaiser operated was California Shipbuilding Corporation on Terminal Island, California, which built hundreds of Liberty ships and Victory ships during World War II. Kaiser Steel was known for making the most of its expensive steel production inputs and eventually captured a significant share of the Pacific Coast steel market by the 1950s. The company's assets included steel mills in Napa, California (acquired from Basalt Rock Company in 1955) and Fontana, California (now operated by California Steel Industries), as well as a former open-pit iron ore mine at Eagle Mountain, California. The steel produced by Kaiser Ventures was also used in Kaiser Motors. Henry John Kaiser was an American businessman who became famous for revolutionizing the shipbuilding industry in the United States. Born in 1882 and passing away in 1967, Kaiser founded Kaiser Shipyards during World War II, which produced Liberty ships that played a crucial role in the war effort. After this success, he went on to establish Kaiser Aluminum and Kaiser Steel, two companies that further solidified his legacy.\n\nKaiser was also a pioneer in the field of healthcare, as he established Kaiser Permanente, a healthcare program that provided medical care to his workers and their families. In addition to his work in the shipbuilding and steel industries, Kaiser also ventured into the automobile business, leading Kaiser-Frazer and Kaiser Motors, both of which were known for their safety features.\n\nKaiser's wealth and success allowed him to pursue other interests, including large construction projects such as civic centers and dams, as well as real estate investments. To give back to the community, he established the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports various charitable causes. Throughout his life, Kaiser's innovative spirit and entrepreneurial mindset made him a respected figure in American business and industry.  Edgar Fosburgh Kaiser Jr. was an American-Canadian businessman and former owner of the Denver Broncos football team. He was born in Portland, Oregon on July 5, 1942, and is the grandson of Henry J. Kaiser, a prominent shipbuilding industrialist. Kaiser earned degrees from Stanford University and Harvard University, including a BA and an MBA. He served in various roles in the U.S. government, including as a White House Fellow and Special Assistant to Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Walter J. Hickel. Kaiser became a Canadian citizen in 1980 and passed away on January 11, 2012.

This movie was released during a time when the internet was still new and mysterious to most people, so it reflects the ideas in a famous hacking manifesto that's quoted in the film. The manifesto talks about how hackers don't have things like skin color or nationality, and how they're seen as criminals even though their crime is just being curious.

They believed in revolutionary socialism and had two main branches: democratic socialists and agrarian socialists. After the February Revolution in 1917, they shared power with other liberal and socialist groups in the Russian Provisional Government. In the first democratic elections held in Russia, the SRs won the most votes. However, the October Revolution changed the political landscape, and the Bolsheviks disbanded the elected government in January 1918. The SRs then split into two groups: pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik. The anti-Bolshevik group, known as the Right SRs, remained loyal to the leader of the Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, but they were defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Russian Civil War (1917-1922) was a complex and multi-sided conflict in Russia after the Russian Revolutions of 1917. Many different groups, including the Red Army (fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin) and the White Army (comprised of various factions supporting monarchism, capitalism, and alternative forms of socialism), fought to determine Russia's political future. Other groups, such as militant socialists and non-ideological Green armies, also participated in the conflict. Eight foreign nations intervened in the war, including the Allied Forces and pro-German armies. The Red Army ultimately defeated the White Army in key battles in Ukraine and Siberia in 1919, and the remaining White forces were defeated in Crimea and evacuated in 1920. Some minor skirmishes continued until 1923, but the war effectively ended in 1923 when Red control was established in the newly formed Soviet Union. The conflict resulted in an estimated 7-12 million casualties, mostly civilians, and has been described as the greatest national catastrophe Europe had seen.In Russia, communism began after the Tsar, Nicholas II, lost power during the February Revolution. A new government called the Provisional Government was set up under Prince Lvov, but the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, refused to accept it and staged a revolution in October 1917. Lenin and the Bolsheviks took control of Russia and established the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. This marked the start of the Russian Civil War between the Bolsheviks (also known as the Reds) and their opposing groups, the Whites. In 1922, the Reds emerged victorious and formed the Soviet Union. Lenin died in 1924, leading to a power struggle among party leaders. Joseph Stalin eventually seized power and ruled the Soviet Union until 1953, promoting a culture of political paranoia and conducting the Great Purge to eliminate his opponents.   Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov (Russian: Лавр Гео́ргиевич Корни́лов, August 18, 1870 – April 13, 1918) was a skilled military officer, explorer, and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the subsequent Russian Civil War. He is best known for the Kornilov Affair, an unsuccessful attempt in August/September 1917 to strengthen the Provisional Government led by Alexander Kerensky, but which led to Kerensky arresting and charging Kornilov with attempting a coup d'état. This event ultimately weakened Kerensky's rule and strengthened the position of the Soviet government and the Bolshevik party."}], "output": "  Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War, which ended in 1922.**"},

It's a terrier breed, which means it's small and energetic. The Scotch Collie is an old breed of dog that originated in Scotland. It used to be one breed, but it was divided into two types: the long-haired (now called Rough Collie) and the short-haired (now called Smooth Collie). The breed is believed to have come from a group of ancient dogs that were brought to Scotland a long time ago, including Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs, and Viking Herding Spitzes. Some of these ancient dogs were also related to Gordon and Irish Setters.The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized dog breed that originated in America. Compared to its cousin, the American Rat Terrier, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is smaller, has shorter legs, and is more muscular. There is a lot of history surrounding the breed's origins, and it shares a common early history with other dog breeds like the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terrier. These early dogs were brought over by immigrants and were used as farm, hunting, and utility dogs, with little to no planned breeding beyond selecting dogs with desirable traits. As a result, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier has a diverse ancestry that includes the Feist, Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, and other breeds. These early dogs were then bred with Beagle or Beagle-cross dogs to enhance their scenting ability, creating the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with its keen sense of smell, high intellect, and strong desire to please its owners. Despite being aloof with strangers, Teddy Roosevelt Terriers are loyal and affectionate companions who love to be near their owners at all times. Feists are small hunting dogs that originated in the United States from terriers brought over by English miners and other working-class immigrants. These terriers were likely crossbred between the Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, and the now-extinct English White Terrier. These dogs were used for hunting rats, and their owners enjoyed gambling on their rat-killing abilities. Over time, some Feists were crossed with other breeds like Whippets, Italian Greyhounds, and Beagles to create a more diverse group of dogs with different skills and purposes."}], "output": "  Great!

Among the few European commanders to defeat the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, he soundly defeated them at the Battle of Agordat in 1893. After a long and successful career in colonial service, he died in combat at the Battle of Adwa and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.The First Italo-Ethiopian War took place between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896. It started because the Italians believed a treaty had turned Ethiopia into an Italian protectorate, but the Ethiopian leader, Menelik II, had the support of his people and other nations. Italy was supported by Germany and Austria, but they were surprised to find that Ethiopia was not alone in its fight against the Italian army. Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia, provided military support, including advisers, training, and weapons. Ethiopia also received diplomatic support from the United Kingdom and France to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial power. The war started in 1895, and initial Italian successes were followed by an Ethiopian counterattack and the siege of an Italian fort. The war ended in a decisive defeat for Italy after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army defeated the heavily outnumbered Italians and forced them to retreat back into Eritrea. The relationship between Ethiopia and Japan is the connection between these two countries.

The set comes in either 4 compact discs or 5 vinyl LPs and features a variety of songs produced by Spector. The first song, To Know Him Is to Love Him, was released in 1958 and was performed by Spector as part of the group The Teddy Bears. The box set includes a booklet with photos, song lyrics, and information about the songs, as well as a small red pin. The song 'To Know Him Is to Love Him' was written and inspired by Phil Spector, who saw the words 'To Know Him Was To Love Him' on his father's tombstone. The song was first recorded by Phil's vocal group, the Teddy Bears, and reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for three weeks in 1958. Later, other artists such as Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton covered the song and changed the title and lyrics to 'To Know You Is to Love You.' In 1987, the song was revived by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris, who recorded a version that topped the U.S. country singles charts.

Let me know if you have any other questions.The Trash Box is a 5-CD box set containing mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings by American bands. It's similar to the earlier Pebbles Box, which was a 5-LP set, and includes almost all of the same songs in the same order. However, the Trash Box has some extra bonus tracks at the end of each CD. These tracks are from the first five volumes of the Pebbles series, which were released by AIP Records. However, the tracks on the Trash Box are different from the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in those volumes. Some of the songs on the Trash Box have never been released anywhere else in the Pebbles series. For example, the well-known song I Fought the Law (but the Law Won) by the Bobby Fuller Four is on the Trash Box, but it's replaced the less common song Wine Wine Wine by Bobby Fuller on Pebbles, Volume 2. In 2003, the American blues-rock band ZZ Top released a box set called Chrome, Smoke & BBQ. This set was notable because it featured the original mixes of all the tracks from the band's first five albums, which had never been released on CD before. At the time, these were the only CD releases that included original mixes from ZZ Top's first album, Rio Grande Mud, and Tejas, aside from a 1977 compilation called The Best of ZZ Top which featured a few tracks from those albums. In 2006, two of the band's albums, Tres Hombres and Fandango!, were reissued with their original mixes.

The squadron was formed in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps and has flown various types of aircraft throughout its history, including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) planes. During World War I, the squadron operated in France and conducted fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions. After the war, the squadron was disbanded in 1919 but was re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF. The squadron saw action in World War II as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific and later flew English Electric Canberra jets in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. The squadron was disbanded again in 1982 after retiring the Canberra jets. It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C Wedgetail. In 2014, one of the squadron's Boeing 737s was deployed to the Middle East as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS. In the 1950s, the English Electric Canberra was a British jet-powered medium bomber that was developed in response to a 1944 Air Ministry request for a successor to the de Havilland Mosquito, a fast-bomber used during World War II. The Canberra was designed to have exceptional high-altitude bombing capabilities and high speeds, which were achieved through the use of new jet propulsion technology. When it first entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) in May 1951, the Canberra became the RAF's first jet-powered bomber aircraft.During World War II, the South West Pacific theatre was a key region of conflict between the Allies and Japan. This area included several countries and territories in the Pacific, such as the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (except for the island of Sumatra), Borneo, Australia, and the mandate Territory of New Guinea (which included the Bismarck Archipelago). The Allied powers defined this region as the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command. During World War II, the United States had military operations in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. This theater was the site of U.S. military activities from 1941 to 1945, during the Pacific War. Initially, there were two U.S. operational commands in the Pacific: the Pacific Ocean Areas (POA) and the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). Admiral Chester W. Nimitz was in charge of the POA, which was divided into three areas: the Central Pacific Area, the North Pacific Area, and the South Pacific Area. General Douglas MacArthur led the SWPA.

This happens when the rear of the car turns more than the front, causing the front wheels to point in the opposite direction of the turn. This is known as oversteering. When this happens, the driver needs to use the steering wheel in the opposite direction of the turn to maintain control of the car, which is called counter-steering. This technique is often used in racing and stunt driving to create a dramatic and impressive turn. D1NZ is the premier drifting series in New Zealand, serving as a clubsport advanced event under MotorSport New Zealand. It was established in 2003 as a small competition among drifting teams from different parts of the country to organize and regulate drifting events. Over the years, the series has grown bigger and more professional, featuring professional drivers with sponsored cars. The series now consists of two championships: Pro and Pro-sport. New competitors typically need to prove themselves in the Pro-sport championship before moving up to the Pro championship, unless they come from an equivalent international series. The organizers aim to promote and educate drifting in New Zealand while providing a safe and regulated environment for competitors. It's important to note that D1NZ is not related to the Japanese D1 Grand Prix series, and it's actually the longest running drifting series in the world.Raimund Harmstorf was a famous German actor born in Hamburg on October 7, 1939.

They had a good draft in 1992, selecting center Alonzo Mourning from Georgetown with the second overall pick. Mourning joined forces with second-year player Larry Johnson and point guard Muggsy Bogues, but the team struggled most of the season with a losing record. However, they finished strong, winning 9 of their last 12 games and finishing third in their division with a 44-38 record, qualifying for their first playoff appearance ever.

Ten years later, the team changed its name back to the Charlotte Hornets, after the New Orleans franchise changed its name to the Pelicans. This means that the Charlotte franchise is actually a continuation of the original Hornets team that existed from 1988 to 2002. The Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball team, representing Texas Tech University, has had nine players drafted into the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) since the league began holding drafts in 1997. Sheryl Swoopes was the first player from Texas Tech to be drafted into the WNBA, selected in the very first player allocation in 1997.

Many readers consider it one of Woolf's most popular novels, as it offers a satirical and humorous take on English literary history. The book follows the adventures of a poet who changes gender and lives for centuries, encountering many of the key figures of English literature along the way.

The show was created and executive produced by Brenda Hampton, who was also known for her work on another popular WB series, 7th Heaven. Safe Harbor was paired with 7th Heaven on The WB's Monday night lineup, but unfortunately, the show was unable to attract a consistent audience after 7th Heaven, the number one show on the network during the 1999-2000 season. Despite moving the show to Sunday nights for its final two episodes, Safe Harbor was ultimately canceled after only ten episodes and one season.

Mexia was based in St. Augustine and had a special job to do with the native people who lived nearby. He was sent to make friends with the Ais tribe, who lived south of St. Augustine and in the Cape Canaveral area. This mission was successful, and it led to a period of peaceful relations between the Spanish and the Ais people. For over 12,000 years, Indigenous people lived in what is now Florida. However, by the early 18th century, most of these original Floridians had died out. Some Apalachees moved to Louisiana, where their descendants live today, while others were taken to Cuba and Mexico by the Spanish in the 18th century. A small number may have also blended in with the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes.The Australian High Commission in London is the official diplomatic representation of Australia in the UK. It is located in a historic building called Australia House, which is a Grade II listed monument. This mission is significant because it is both Australia's first diplomatic mission and the longest continuously occupied diplomatic mission in the UK, meaning it has been serving as the country's representative in the UK for a long time. A diplomatic mission is a group of people from one country or organization sent to another country to represent their home country or organization officially. In simple terms, a diplomatic mission can be thought of as an ambassador's office in a foreign country. The resident mission, which is usually called an embassy, is located in the capital city of the receiving country and serves as the main office for the diplomatic representatives of the sending country. Consulates, on the other hand, are smaller diplomatic missions that are not located in the capital of the receiving country. These missions can also represent their home country in one or more other countries, making them both resident and non-resident embassies."}], "output": "  Ais tribe**."},

Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional? \n\n Passage:   In the Rostker v. Goldberg case, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 1981 that the practice of only requiring men to register for the draft was constitutional. After much debate and discussion in Congress, the law was passed to apply only to men. Later, some lawyers, including Robert L. Goldberg, challenged the law, arguing that it was unfair to only require men to register. In a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was not a violation of the equal protection clause of the due process clause and allowed the law to stand as is. (The named defendant in the case is Bernard D. Rostker, the Director of the Selective Service System.) In the United States, conscription, also known as the draft, has been used by the federal government in four major conflicts: the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars). The draft was created in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act, which was the first peacetime draft in the country's history. From 1940 to 1973, men were drafted into the military to fill vacancies that couldn't be filled through voluntary means, both during peacetime and times of conflict. The draft was discontinued when the military transitioned to an all-volunteer force. However, all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are still required to register with the Selective Service System, which remains in place as a contingency plan in case a draft is needed again in the future.On May 9, 2010, a special parade was held in Kiev to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in World War II. The parade was attended by important military officials, including the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces, General Ivan Svyda, who inspected the parade. The commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Colonel General Gennady Vorobyov, led the parade, while President Viktor Yanukovych gave a special speech. A total of 2,500 troops from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus took part in the parade, along with 17 military orchestras led by the Chief of the Military Music Department of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Major General Volodymyr Derkach. The Indian armed forces and veterans have been demanding the One Rank One Pension (OROP) principle for years, which means that all personnel of the same rank and with the same length of service would receive the same pension, regardless of when they retired. This demand stems from a broader issue of pay-pension equity, which was sparked by a controversial decision made by the Indira Gandhi-led Indian National Congress (INC) government in 1973. Two years after India's historic victory in the 1971 Bangladesh war, the government unexpectedly reduced pensions for armed forces personnel by 20-40%, while increasing civilian pensions by 20%. This decision was made without consulting the armed forces headquarters, which upset many veterans and led to the OROP movement."}], "output": "  The practice of requiring men to register for the draft was held constitutional in the Rostker v.

Some people consider Buffett to be one of the best investors in the world, and as of August 2017, he is the second richest person in the United States and the fourth richest person in the world with a total net worth of $76.9 billion. Warren Buffett introduced the concept of owner earnings in 1986, which is a simple yet powerful way to value a company. Essentially, the value of a business is calculated by adding up all the expected future cash flows (owner earnings) that the company is expected to generate over its entire lifespan, minus any earnings that the company will reinvest back into the business. This approach helps to provide a more accurate picture of a company's true value, as it takes into account the actual cash that will be available to shareholders over time, rather than just looking at accounting profits.  Howard Graham Buffett is an American businessman, former politician, philanthropist, photographer, farmer, and conservationist.

The film was shot on location in Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, Arizona, and at the Montezuma Castle National Monument near Sedona. However, things didn't go as planned during filming. The local Yavapai Indians who were hired as extras refused to enter the cliff dwellings because they believed they were the dwelling place of the dead. This caused a delay in production, as the filmmakers needed to find a replacement for the Yavapai Indians. In the end, a group of Navajos were brought in from a reservation 137 miles away to take their place. Montezuma Castle National Monument in Camp Verde, Arizona is home to a group of well-preserved dwellings that were built and used by the Sinagua people, an ancient culture related to the Hohokam and other indigenous peoples of the southwestern United States. These dwellings were constructed between 1100 and 1425 AD and feature five stories and twenty rooms.

He has written several books, including the only official biography of the Beatles, a famous rock band. In 1967, a British film called Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush was made based on the novel of the same name by Hunter Davies. The movie was planned to be shown at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival, but the festival was cancelled due to the May 1968 events in France.The phrase Here we go round the prune bush has multiple meanings and can be used in different contexts. In a nursery rhyme, it refers to a game where children dance around a prune bush, but it can also be used to describe a situation where something is constantly changing or repeating in a cycle. For example, if someone is going through a difficult time and can't seem to escape a particular problem, you might say Here we go round the prune bush again! In this way, the phrase can be used to express frustration or annoyance at a repetitive or never-ending situation. The song The Wheels on the Bus was written by Verna Hills in the United States no later than 1939. It's a very popular children's song in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada, and kids love to sing it on bus trips to pass the time. One reason the song is so catchy is that it has a simple, repetitive melody, similar to the song 99 Bottles of Beer. The Wheels on the Bus is actually based on an older British song called Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, and some people also sing it to the tune of Buffalo Gals, as done by Raffi."}], "output": "  British author Edward Hunter Davies was born on January 7, 1936.**"},

When combined in a specific ratio of 70/30, the mixture becomes an explosive. During the early 20th century, Shellite was commonly used as a filling in armor-piercing shells used by the Royal Navy. Picric acid is a chemical compound with the formula (ON)CHOH. Its full name is 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, or TNP for short. The name picric comes from the Greek word for bitter, which refers to the bitter taste of the compound. Picric acid is one of the most acidic types of phenols, which are a class of chemicals. Historically, picric acid was used primarily as an explosive, but it has also been used in medicine (as an antiseptic) and in the production of dyes.Isopropyl alcohol, also known as propan-2-ol or dimethyl carbinol, is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CHO or CHOH or CHCHOHCH (sometimes represented as i-PrOH). It's a colorless, flammable liquid with a strong odor. This compound is called a secondary alcohol because the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms, which are linked together in a (CH)CH pattern. Isopropyl alcohol is similar to 1-propanol, but they have a slightly different chemical structure. It has a wide range of uses in industry and the home, including as an ingredient in antiseptics, disinfectants, and detergents. Alcohol is a type of organic compound that has a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to a carbon atom. This carbon is usually connected to other carbon or hydrogen atoms. One important class of alcohols are simple acyclic alcohols, which have the general formula CHOH.

It was named after the Battle of Maiwand, which took place during the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878-1880). The statue was erected in 1884 to honor the 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot who died in the battle. Locals sometimes refer to the statue as the Forbury Lion. The Reading Post (formerly known as the Reading Evening Post) was a local newspaper that served the town of Reading, Berkshire, and surrounding areas. The newspaper's title page featured an iconic image of the Maiwand Lion, a well-known landmark located at Forbury Gardens. The Reading Post was published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd., a division of Trinity Mirror plc, until 2009.The Kargil War Memorial, also known as the Vijaypath, is a war memorial built by the Indian Army in Dras, near the foothills of Tololing Hill. The memorial is around 5 kilometers away from the city center and is located on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway 1D. It honors the soldiers and officers of the Indian Army who died during the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan, which became known as the Kargil War. The memorial has a large epitaph with the names of all the soldiers who died in the war. Every year on July 26, the Prime Minister of India pays tribute to the soldiers at the Amar Jawan Jyothi at the India Gate in New Delhi, while simultaneously celebrating Kargil Vijay Diwas at the memorial. The main attraction of the memorial is a sandstone wall with the names of all the Indian army personnel who lost their lives during the war. Visitors can also see some of the peaks that were captured back from Pakistan. To commemorate the 13th anniversary of India's victory in the war, a giant national flag was hoisted at the Kargil war memorial, weighing 15 kilograms. The Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial located on the cathedral green in Exeter, the capital of Devon, in southwest England. It was designed by renowned architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and is one of fifteen War Crosses he designed to a similar specification. Of these, only two were meant to serve as civic memorials in cities. Initially, the Devon County War Memorial Committee wanted to build a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to honor the county's war dead, but due to funding issues, this plan was abandoned. After considering several proposals, the committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead. They chose to locate the memorial on the green in front of the cathedral after scouting several sites. Unfortunately, the committee failed to work together with another committee responsible for creating a war memorial for Exeter, resulting in two separate memorials - one for the county on the cathedral green and another for the city in Northernhay Gardens."}], "output": "  The English local newspaper, featuring the sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury gardens, changed names from the Reading Evening Post to the Reading Post in 2009.**"},

He was the son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the founder of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle. Aonghus Mór took over as leader after his father's death in the middle of the 13th century. At that time, the rulers of the Isles were very independent and only nominally acknowledged the authority of the Scottish Crown. However, Aonghus Mór became involved in helping Irish tribes resist the growing power of the Anglo-Irish in northern Ireland. This could have been part of a larger effort by Clann Domhnaill and other Irish kindreds to form alliances and gain support against Scottish encroachment. The Kingdom of the Isles was a group of islands in the North Atlantic that existed from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. These islands included the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde, and the Isle of Man. The Norse people called these islands the Suðreyjar, or Southern Isles, to distinguish them from the Norðreyjar or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland. The historical records are incomplete, so we don't know much about the kingdom's exact boundaries and rulers. Some of the rulers called themselves kings of Mann and the Isles, but not all of them did. The islands are quite large, covering over 8300 square kilometers and stretching more than 500 kilometers from north to south. During this time, the islands had overlords from Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland, or Orkney, but they also had periods of independence. There were also competing claims for some or all of the territory.In the 13th and 14th centuries, the leaders of the Clann Domhnaill clan before they became known as Lords of the Isles were called Lord of Islay. The first person to use this title was Aonghus Mór, the son of the clan's founder, Domhnall mac Raghnaill. The title of Lord of Islay was commonly used by these leaders and later members of the clan. Forests in Himachal Pradesh cover a vast area of 37,691 square kilometers, which is about 38.3% of the state's total land area. In the past, these forests were a significant source of income for the state, but most of the original forests were cleared. However, the focus has shifted from exploiting the forests to conserving them. The state government is working to increase the forest cover to 50% of the total land area through various projects, such as establishing protected areas like National Parks, to preserve and expand the forests."}], "output": "  The Isles who were led by Aonghus Mór and covered a total land area of over 8300 km2 are the Kingdom of the Isles. **"},

The band consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. They became known as the most influential rock band of their time and were widely regarded as the best act of the rock era. The Beatles got their start in music by playing a mix of skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll. As their music evolved, they experimented with different styles, including pop ballads, Indian music, psychedelia, and hard rock. They also used unusual recording techniques and incorporated classical elements into their music. In 1963, the Beatles became extremely popular, and their music grew more sophisticated over the years. The band's primary songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, were seen as symbols of the ideals of the 1960s counterculture. David Bruce Spizer is a lawyer from New Orleans, Louisiana, who has gained recognition for his expertise on The Beatles. He has written eight books on the band's history and recordings, and is often sought out as a source of information by other authors and media outlets. As a tax attorney, Spizer has built a successful career in his day job, but his real passion is sharing his knowledge of The Beatles with others.Marsha Albert, born in 1948, is credited with sparking the Beatlemania phenomenon in the United States in the early 1960s. As a 15-year-old girl, Marsha introduced The Beatles' song I Want to Hold Your Hand on American radio for the first time on December 17, 1963. This was a significant moment because it forced a major record company to release the Beatles' debut single earlier than planned, during the holiday season when record companies typically didn't release new music. Beatles historian and author Bruce Spizer confirmed this in 2004. Cargo Records was a Canadian independent record label and distributor that operated in the 1980s and 1990s. Based in Montreal, the company released albums on its own label and also helped smaller independent labels distribute their albums, making it one of the biggest and most influential Canadian record companies of the alternative rock era."}], "output": "  Bruce Spizer is an expert on The Beatles.**"},

The Orioles are one of the original eight teams in the AL, established in 1901, and started their first season as the Milwaukee Brewers in Wisconsin before moving to St. Louis, Missouri and becoming the St. Louis Browns. After 52 years in St. Louis, the team was purchased by a group of Baltimore business and civic leaders, including lawyer/civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., in 1953. The team is currently majority-owned by lawyer Peter Angelos. Marcus Wayne Garland was a professional baseball player who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine seasons from 1973 to 1981. During this time, he played for the Baltimore Orioles from 1973 to 1976 and the Cleveland Indians from 1977 to 1981. Garland was one of the lucky few players who benefited from the introduction of MLB free agency in 1976. However, his career was cut short due to a serious injury to his arm, which made it difficult for him to perform at his best. Despite his best efforts, he was constantly criticized by the Cleveland Indians' management and fans for not living up to his contract, even though his decline in performance was caused by the injury.

This lamp produces a brighter light, around 6 to 10 candela, compared to earlier lamps. The lamp's design allows for more complete combustion of the candle wick and oil, which means it needs to be trimmed less often. The Lewis lamp is a special light fixture used in lighthouses. It was invented by Winslow Lewis and patented in 1810. The Lewis lamp used less oil than other lamps used before it, which made it a big selling point. It worked like an Argand lamp, but with some extra parts to help it shine brighter. The inventor of the Argand lamp, Aimé Argand, came up with a similar design that became popular in Europe. However, the Lewis lamp design was chosen by the United States to be used in their lighthouses.A hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is a type of lamp that is used in physics and chemistry for producing specific wavelengths of light. HCLs are particularly useful in atomic absorption spectrometers and lasers because they can produce a steady, consistent stream of light at a specific frequency. The hollow cathode effect is what makes HCLs so useful - it allows them to conduct electricity at a lower voltage and with more current than other types of lamps, making them more efficient and reliable. In simple terms, the hollow cathode effect allows the lamp to suck up electricity more efficiently, which means it can produce more light with less power. Antoine Quinquet was a French pharmacist who was born in Soissons on March 9, 1745. After completing his apprenticeship as an apothecary in Soissons in 1760, he moved to Paris in 1777 to work for a pharmacist named Antoine Baumé. During his time in Paris, Quinquet met Aimé Argand, a well-known pharmacist from Geneva. In 1779, Quinquet returned to Paris and opened his own pharmacy, where he worked for the rest of his life."}], "output": "  The lamp used in many lighthouses is similar to the Argand lamp, which was patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand.**"},

They have only advanced to the knockout rounds once, when they reached the round of 16 in 2014 before losing to Germany. Interestingly, 32 years prior, Algeria came close to advancing to the second round of the 1982 World Cup after defeating both West Germany and Chile. However, an arrangement match between West Germany and Austria ultimately eliminated them. In 2014, Algeria finally qualified for the round of 16 for the first time. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th FIFA World Cup, a tournament for men's national football teams held every four years. This particular tournament took place in Brazil from June 12 to July 13, 2014, after Brazil was chosen to host the event in 2007.

As a manager, he played a crucial role in qualifying the Swedish national football team for the FIFA World Cup in Mexico in 1970, after defeating France and other teams in the qualifying rounds. This was a significant achievement, as it marked Sweden's first appearance in a World Cup in 12 years and their first qualification in 20 years, following their hosting of the 1958 FIFA World Cup. However, Sweden did not qualify for the World Cups in 1954, 1962, and 1966."}], "output": "  Brazil.**"},

American and Filipino soldiers fought against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. The battle lasted for a month and resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 civilians and the complete destruction of the city. The fighting was some of the worst in the Pacific and Japanese soldiers committed mass murder against Filipino civilians. The battle also destroyed important historical buildings and cultural landmarks that date back to the city's founding. After three years of Japanese occupation, the city was finally captured, which was a key victory for General Douglas MacArthur in the campaign to retake the Philippines. During the American Civil War, there were six major battles fought over the course of seven days in June and July 1862 near Richmond, Virginia. Confederate General Robert E. Lee successfully drove the Union Army of the Potomac, led by Major General George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula. Although some people call this series of battles the Seven Days Campaign, it was actually the final part of a larger military operation known as the Peninsula Campaign.During the Seven Days Battles of the American Civil War, which took place from June 25 to July 1, 1862, several Confederate States Army units and commanders fought.

The song was originally sung by Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews in the movie, and it's also featured in the Cameron Mackintosh/Disney musical adaptation of Mary Poppins. You can hear this song in two different Disney theme parks: in the Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios, and during the Mary Poppins segment of the Mickey's PhilharMagic show at Disneyland. The Great Movie Ride was a dark ride attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Walt Disney World Resort. It used a combination of Audio-Animatronic figures, real sets, live actors, special effects, and projected images to bring iconic scenes from twelve classic movies to life. When the attraction first opened on May 1, 1989, it was located inside a replica of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, one of Hollywood's most famous movie palaces.In the movie Mary Poppins, there's a song called I Love to Laugh (also known as We Love to Laugh). It was written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. In the scene where Uncle Albert sings the song, he and Bert start floating up towards the ceiling because they're so happy. Mary Poppins eventually joins in and starts floating too. The idea of the scene is that laughter can make people feel light and happy, like they're floating on air. It's similar to how Peter Pan's flight power works, too. If someone's thinking about something sad, they'll come back down to earth. The song is saying that laughter is really important and can make people feel good, even if Mary Poppins doesn't always approve of Uncle Albert's wild behavior. The infectious mood even makes the Banks children and Bert start floating too! In the movie Mary Poppins, there is a song called Step In Time that is composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The dance choreography for this song was done by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood. The song is sung by Bert, a chimney sweep played by Dick Van Dyke, and the other chimney sweeps while they are working on the rooftops of London. In the first part of the song, Bert sings lines like Kick your knees up, round the chimney / Flap like a birdie, up on the railing / Over the rooftops and link your elbows. An interlude follows, with Bert, Mary Poppins, Michael, Jane, and all the chimney sweepers dancing around the rooftops. Admiral Boom watches them with a telescope and thinks they're Hottentots, so he orders the chimney sweepers to scram with colorful fireworks. In the second part of the song, the chimney sweepers enter the home of George Banks and Mrs. Brill comes in, screaming They're at it again! and trying to hit one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan. The song ends with Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins, and Bert in the same place, with Ellen running around the dining room and the chimney sweepers flipping her. The other phrases in the song are Votes for women, It's the master, and What's all this?"}], "output": "  Great question!

In simple terms, a walkdown in country music is a bassline that connects two chords that are three notes apart. This is often done by playing an inverted chord (a chord played upside down) between the root notes of the first two chords. For example, if you start with the chords G Major and E minor, you can play a walkdown by going from G to D/F♯ (an inverted chord) followed by Em. This creates a smooth, stepwise motion in the bassline. Walkdowns can be played by any instrument in a country band, including the upright bass, electric bass, guitar, or piano."}], "output": "  Chris Lee, the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist of the band Supagroup, is married to Sean Yseult, the former bassist of the band White Zombie.**"},

These remains, NMMNH P-18400, include a tibia, vertebrae, and other fragments, and came from a layer of rock known as the Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation, near Fort Wingate. In an unpublished thesis by Andrew Heckert, the name Cinizasaurus hunti was proposed for the specimen, but it was never officially adopted and was first mentioned in scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Triassic fossils from North America that were thought to belong to dinosaurs. In this redescription, the authors could only classify the material as belonging to a group of ancient creatures known as Archosauriformes. Sphaerotholus is a type of dinosaur called a pachycephalosaurid, which lived during the Upper Cretaceous period in the western United States and Canada. So far, three species of Sphaerotholus have been discovered: S. goodwini from New Mexico, S. buchholtzae from Montana, and S. edmontonense from Alberta. The name Sphaerotholus comes from the Greek words sphaira, meaning ball, and tholos, meaning dome, which refers to the distinctive dome-shaped skull of these dinosaurs. It's interesting that Sphaerotholus lived from the Campanian period in New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian period in Montana, which means it survived for about 7-8 million years. When it was first discovered in 2002, the scientists who described the genus said that Sphaerotholus is different from other pachycephalosaurids in that it has a special bone on its skull called a parietosquamosal bar that gets smaller as you look at it from the side, and it's surrounded by a single row of bumps and one bump on the side. Because of these unique features, Sphaerotholus is considered a very specialized or derived pachycephalosaurid."}], "output": "  McFarland, USA came out first.**"},

Some people believe he is the same person as the legendary British king Guiderius. The Catuvellauni were a Celtic tribe or state located in southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest. We know about them through inscriptions that date back to the 4th century.The Romano-British culture emerged in Britain after the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 43 and established the province of Britannia. This culture blended the Roman and indigenous Briton cultures, with the Britons being a Celtic-speaking people. Despite the Roman legions leaving Britain in AD 410, the Romano-British culture survived for several centuries, until AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived. During this time, the southern part of Britain maintained a subtle form of Roman culture, using everyday Latin in their writing. The history of Wales begins thousands of years ago, when the first humans arrived in the region. Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales at least 230,000 years ago, while modern humans arrived around 31,000 BC. People continued to live in Wales continuously from the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and the region has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, the region was controlled by the Celtic Britons and their language. The Romans conquered Wales in AD 43 and ruled the area until the 5th century, when they left and allowed the Anglo-Saxons to invade. After the Romans departed, the Brittonic language and culture began to split into different groups, and the Welsh people became one of the largest of these groups. They are often discussed separately from the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples from the 11th century onwards."}], "output": "  The Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 ruled southeastern Britain prior to the conquest by the Roman Empire.**"},

For example, in California, the State Assembly (the lower house) has 80 members, each representing a fraction of California's population, while the State Senate (the upper house) has 40 members, each representing a different fraction of the population. The nesting process involves defining the voting districts for the State Assembly first, and then dividing those districts into smaller areas to create the State Senate districts. Alternatively, the State Senate districts can be defined first, and then the Assembly districts can be created by splitting each Senate district into two.

Frisian speakers in South Jutland (modern-day Northern Friesland) also used Old Frisian, but there are no medieval texts from this region. The language of the earlier inhabitants of the area between the Zuiderzee and Ems River, mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus, is known only through a few personal names and place-names. Old Frisian evolved into Middle Frisian, which was spoken from the 16th to the 19th century. The Leda is a river in northwestern Germany, specifically in the state of Lower Saxony. It flows into the Ems River near the town of Leer. The Leda originates from the confluence of two rivers, the Sagter Ems and the Soeste (Dreyschloot), located near the town of Barßel. The river is about 29 kilometers long, and the last 1.9 kilometers are navigable for large ships. The settlement of Kloster Muhde, located on the southern bank of the Leda, is situated opposite Leer. The word Muhde comes from the Old Frisian language and means river mouth.German (also known as Deutsch) is a language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe. It's the main language spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (in Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein. In fact, it's one of the two official languages of Luxembourg too. German is closely related to other West Germanic languages like Afrikaans, Dutch, English, Frisian, Low German/Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. Of all these languages, German is the second most widely spoken after English. English is a language that originated in medieval England and has since become a widely spoken language around the world. It gets its name from the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England. Although it is related to other Germanic languages like Frisian, English has been heavily influenced by other languages, including Norse (a North Germanic language), Latin, and Romance languages like French."}], "output": "  The Old Frisian language spoken in the area where the settlement of Kloster Muhde is located derived its name from the Old Frisian word \"Muhde\", which means \"river mouth\". **"},

Harrison wrote the song in 1967, while he was still a member of the Beatles, in response to the public reaction to Paul McCartney's announcement that he had taken the drug LSD. This news caused a similar reaction in the media as John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity in 1966. The song's lyrics encourage self-awareness and careful consideration of one's actions, while the music features unusual time signature changes from the standard 4/4 beat to 9/8. The song's lyrics also reflect the era in which it was written by revisiting themes first introduced in Beatles songs like Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love. George Harrison wrote the song Within You Without You for the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. This was Harrison's second song written in the Indian classical style, after Love You To. He was inspired to write the song after spending six weeks in India with his sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, in September and October of 1966. The song features Indian instruments like the sitar, dilruba, and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle. The recording was different from the Beatles' usual work because it had a spiritual and introspective feel to it, reflecting Harrison's interest in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas. Although Harrison was the only Beatle to contribute a composition to the album, his support for Indian culture is evident in the inclusion of Indian spiritual leaders like Paramahansa Yogananda on the album cover.Love Songs: A Compilation...

Jivamukti Yoga teaches that compassion for all living beings is essential for spiritual growth. Students are encouraged to adopt a vegan diet to minimize harm to the environment and other living beings. The method also emphasizes the concept of shunyata, or the idea that everything we experience is created by our perception of it. This means that by changing our perspective, we can change ourselves and the world around us.

Born in Iceland and living in Canada, Jon follows three Icelandic-Canadians as they embark on a journey to discover their Icelandic heritage by traveling to Iceland. Along with their experiences in Iceland, Jon also captures their reactions when they return to Canada and attend the Islendingadagurinn festival in Gimli, which celebrates Icelandic culture. The documentary focuses on the contrasts in perspective between Jon's viewpoint on Canadian culture and the perspectives of the three Icelandic-Canadians on their quest for their ancestral heritage. The Five Obstructions is a 2003 documentary film directed by Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth. The movie is a mix of a regular documentary and experimental filmmaking. The idea is that Lars von Trier, a well-known filmmaker, challenged his friend and mentor Jørgen Leth to recreate one of Leth's old films, called The Perfect Human, five times. Each time, von Trier would give Leth a different obstacle or challenge to make the task harder. This is all done as a way for von Trier to pay tribute to his favorite film and to see how Leth would handle the challenge.A film laboratory is a business that provides services to the movie industry. Here, experts work on film material, like negative and positive prints, in various formats like 65-70mm, 35mm, 16mm, 9.5mm, and 8mm.

The film challenges the filmmaker, Lars von Trier, to recreate one of his mentor's old films, The Perfect Human, five times, each time with a different obstacle or challenge.\n\nTherefore, while both films are documentaries, they belong to different genres based on their specific themes and formats."},

The PFSh held power until 1943, when Italy surrendered to the Allies. After Italy's defeat, Albania was occupied by Germany, and the PFSh was replaced by a new group called the Guard of Greater Albania. Tefik Selim Mborja was an important figure in Albanian politics during the early 20th century. He served as the leader of the Albanian Fascist Party during World War II. This party was a political organization that believed in fascist ideology, which emphasized nationalism, authoritarianism, and suppression of political opposition. As the general secretary of the party, Mborja played a significant role in shaping the party's policies and actions during this time.In September 1982, Sweden held general elections. The results saw the return of the Swedish Social Democratic Party to power after six years in the opposition. This was the longest period the Social Democrats had been in opposition since the early 1900s. The center-right coalition, led by Thorbjörn Fälldin, had lost power the year before the election when one of its parties, the Moderate Party, withdrew from the government in protest of the centrist tax policies of the Fälldin government. After the Social Democrats regained power, their leader, Olof Palme, was successfully re-elected as Prime Minister. Palme had previously held the position from 1969 to 1976 and went on to retain it until his assassination in 1986.

However, in 1737, he gave up his claim after being defeated by Saif's Persian allies. He was later chosen as Imam again in 1743 during another Persian invasion, and once more held power in the interior while Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi was recognized as the ruler by the coastal people. Unfortunately, he died in battle against Ahmad bin Said in 1749, and Ahmad became the undisputed ruler of the country."}], "output": "  Sure!

When he was just 16 years old, he was arrested by the United States and held at Guantanamo Bay for ten years. During his time there, he pleaded guilty to some charges, including the murder of U.S. Army Sergeant 1st Class Christopher Speer. However, Khadr later claimed that he had falsely pleaded guilty in order to be returned to Canada. In 2017, Khadr sued the Canadian government for violating his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The lawsuit was settled with a payment of $10.5 million (approximately $8 million USD) from the government and an apology. The documentary Son of al Qaeda is about a young Canadian named Abdurahman Khadr, whose father was a close associate of Osama bin Laden. The documentary was produced by Terence McKenna and Nazim Baksh. Abdurahman's younger brother, Omar Khadr, was also detained at Guantanamo Bay.A group of people called Fraley and others sued Facebook in California because they thought the company used their names and pictures without permission in ads called 'Sponsored Stories.' The case went to a settlement, and as a result, Facebook sent checks to the people in the group worth $15 each starting from November 17, 2016. Insurance companies have a legal duty to settle claims in a fair and reasonable manner. This duty is implied in the insurance policy and is based on the insurer's promise to act in good faith. While most policies don't explicitly state that they promise to settle claims, insurers still have a duty to attempt to settle claims promptly and fairly. In California, if an insurer wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement offer within the policy limits, they can be held liable for the full amount of the judgment against the insured, even if it exceeds the policy limits.\n\nThe reason for this duty is that when an insurer receives a settlement offer that is within the policy limits, a conflict of interest arises between the insurer and the policyholder. The insurer must decide whether to accept the settlement or risk losing the case and being responsible for the full judgment. If the insurer denies coverage, they do so at their own risk. The insurer must also inform the policyholder of any settlement offers and cannot unreasonably coerce the policyholder into contributing to a settlement fund."}], "output": " $10.5 million (approximately $8 million USD).**"},

The cyclone started as a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on October 25, and its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days earlier. The storm gradually strengthened as it moved west-northwest, reaching cyclone strength the next day. Taking advantage of favorable weather conditions, the storm rapidly intensified and reached super cyclone status on October 28, with winds of up to 160 mph (260 km/h) and a record-low pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg). The cyclone made landfall in Odisha on October 29, and although it slowly weakened due to land interaction and dry air, it remained quasi-stationary for two days before drifting offshore as a weaker system. The storm finally dissipated over the Bay of Bengal on November 1. Kathantara (which means 'Another Story' in Odia) is a 2007 Indian Oriya language film directed by Himansu Khatua. The movie tells the story of the hardships faced by people during the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which caused widespread destruction and loss of life in the state of Odisha (formerly known as Orissa).In May 2017, Severe Tropical Cyclone Donna formed in the South Pacific, becoming the strongest off-season tropical cyclone on record. Donna was the 21st tropical disturbance, 3rd named storm, and 2nd severe tropical cyclone of the year. It started as an area of disturbed weather west of Fiji on May 1st and slowly moved eastward in a favorable environment. By May 3rd, it had intensified into a tropical depression and 12 hours later, it became a Category 1 cyclone. Donna's winds continued to strengthen, reaching its peak as a Category 4 cyclone on May 6th. However, wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken, and it reintensified into a Category 5 cyclone on May 8th. Donna then entered an area of strong westerly flow and rapidly weakened, eventually dissipating by May 16th. In the 1980s, Severe Tropical Cyclone Anne was one of the strongest tropical cyclones in the South Pacific. It started as a weak tropical depression near Tuvalu on January 5, 1988, along with another cyclone in the North-Western Pacific basin. Over the next few days, the system moved southwest and developed into a tropical cyclone, which was named Anne on January 8. Anne rapidly intensified and became a major tropical cyclone on January 11, reaching peak intensity as a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale and a Category 4 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After turning southward, Anne hit New Caledonia on January 12, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory. The system weakened as it interacted with another tropical cyclone, and Anne eventually became a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia."}], "output": "  Kathantara**"},

It is the second ship ever named after the U.S. state of New Jersey. Interestingly, New Jersey has earned more battle stars for its actions in combat than any of the other three completed Iowa-class battleships. In fact, it was the only U.S. battleship to provide gunfire support during the Vietnam War. Rear Admiral J. Edward Snyder, USN (Ret.), was a notable naval officer who served as the captain of the USS New Jersey during its deployment to Vietnam in 1968. He was well-liked by his crew for his relaxed leadership style, which helped to motivate them during their time at sea. According to those who served under him, Captain Snyder was a sailor's captain, meaning that he understood the needs and concerns of his crew and was able to lead them effectively.The United States Navy and South Vietnam worked together in a successful operation called Operation Market Time, which started in 1965. The goal of this operation was to stop the flow of soldiers, weapons, and supplies from North Vietnam to parts of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The US Coast Guard also participated in the operation, providing heavily armed patrol boats and large cutters that were equipped with cannons for battle and gunfire support. These boats and cutters were used to patrol the coast and rivers, blocking the flow of supplies from the north. The USS Trippe (FF-1075) was a frigate in the US Navy that was built in Louisiana and commissioned in September 1970. After completing training and a surveillance mission, the ship entered a shipyard in Boston for an overhaul and the installation of a new missile system called the Basic Point Defense Missile System. This system featured short-range missiles called Sea Sparrows and was the first of its kind on a destroyer-type ship in the Navy. The ship spent the first months of 1972 testing its new weapons and participating in exercises. In June, the Trippe passed through the Panama Canal and headed to Southeast Asia, where it provided air and missile protection services during the Vietnam War. The ship then traveled to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, visiting many ports in the region. After a deployment that took it around the world, the Trippe returned to the US East Coast in December 1972."}], "output": "  Rear Admiral J. Edward Snyder, USN (Ret.).**"},

It's the official mammal of British Columbia. What makes this bear unique is that about 10% of its population has white or cream-colored fur, similar to polar bears. This coloration is due to a rare genetic trait that is only found in this subspecies. They are not albinos or related to polar bears, and they are the same species as other black bears found in Alaska and other parts of North America. Sometimes, a mother black bear will give birth to a white cub, but this is just a rare genetic occurrence and not a guarantee that the cub will have white fur.

This war was fought between Irish Catholic immigrants and French Canadians. The conflict started when a group of Irish men, led by a timber operator named Peter Aylen, attacked other timber operations. This group was called the Shiners. They also attacked French Canadian timber rafts and fought with the French Canadians on the streets of Bytown. French Canadians, also known as Franco-Canadians or Canadiens, are a group of people who trace their ancestry back to French settlers who arrived in Canada from the 17th century onwards. Today, French Canadians make up the largest French-speaking population in Canada, accounting for about 22% of the total population.The Oku people, also known as Oku Mohammedans or Aku Mohammedans in Sierra Leone and the Gambia, are an ethnic group in both countries. They are the descendants of freed Africans from Southwest Nigeria who were brought to Sierra Leone and the Gambia in the mid-19th century. These individuals formed a unique ethnic group and are predominantly Muslim. The British colonial government officially recognized the Oku Mohammedan community as a distinct group in Sierra Leone. However, while the Sierra Leone government considers the Oku people to be part of the Creole ethnic group, many Sierra Leoneans view them as a separate ethnic group. The Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) is an Irish Catholic organization that was founded in New York City in 1836. The group is open to anyone who is Catholic and either born in Ireland or of Irish descent. Its original purpose was to protect Catholic churches from anti-Catholic forces in the mid-1800s and to help Irish Catholic immigrants who faced discrimination or difficult working conditions, particularly in the coal mining industry in Pennsylvania. Many members of the AOH had ties to the Molly Maguires, a secret society of Irish American miners who fought for better working conditions and against discrimination. Over time, the AOH became a significant political force for Irish Americans."}], "output": "  The ethnic group who settled in Canada in the 17th century and participated in the Shiners' War is the French Canadians.**"},

These things can be anything from land and buildings to intangible things like books or ideas. The law decides who has the highest claim to these things and whether they are real (like land) or not (like a book). There has been a lot of debate among law scholars about what can be considered a thing that can be owned or controlled, and when someone becomes the priority owner of that thing. Joshua D.

Brabejum is a unique genus of tree that only has one species, Brabejum stellatifolium, which is commonly known as wild almond, bitter almond, or ghoeboontjie. This tree is found in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, where it grows along the banks of streams in thickets. The plant is special because it's the only member of the large grevilleoid subfamily found in Africa.\n\nThe Brabejum tree is a small to medium-sized bushy tree with branches that grow close to the ground and produce many tall, sturdy stems. The leaves are long and narrow, with rounded teeth, and they grow in groups of six along the branches. In the summer, the tree produces white flowers that are packed closely together on long stems that grow from the leaf axils.

It was once a traditional Kaurna ceremonial meeting place and the site of early European settlement. Warriparinga is also known by other names such as Fairford, Laffer's Triangle, and the Sturt Triangle. It is bordered by three roads - Marion Road, Sturt Road, and South Road - and the Sturt River flows through it as it travels from Sturt Gorge to the Adelaide Plains.   In Canada, the President of the Queen's Privy Council (also known as the President du Conseil privé de la Reine pour le Canada in French) is officially in charge of the Privy Council Office. However, this person's role is mostly ceremonial and they only preside over meetings of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, which is a group that only gathers for important events such as the accession of a new monarch or the prince's marriage. The last time the President of the Privy Council had to preside over a meeting of the Privy Council was in 1981, when Prince Charles of Wales got engaged to Lady Diana Spencer. In other words, this position is similar to the role of Lord President of the Council in the United Kingdom."}], "output": "  Mark Masons' Hall.**"},

Prior to his invention, Ward was a hairdresser from Yorkshire, England. However, Ward's insistence on retaining majority ownership of the formula for Starlite (51%) and his belief that the technology was worth billions of dollars hindered its commercial success. Maurice Ward, an amateur chemist and hairdresser, invented a special material called Starlite in the 1970s and 1980s. Starlite is said to be able to withstand and insulate against extremely high temperatures. In 1993, Ward's invention received a lot of attention when it was featured on the popular science and technology show Tomorrow's World. Ward's granddaughter, Kimberly, came up with the name Starlite.  William Levett (also known as William de Livet), who lived around 1200-1270, was the lord of a small village in South Yorkshire called Hooton Levitt, which was named after his ancestors.

It serves as the headquarters of the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited. The building is situated at 1 Garden Road, in the Central and Western District of Hong Kong Island. In other words, it's located in the heart of Hong Kong Island, close to many other important landmarks and financial institutions. One Raffles Place, previously known as Overseas Union Bank Centre or OUB Centre, is one of the tallest skyscrapers in Singapore. It was the tallest building in the city along with UOB Plaza and Republic Plaza until 2016, when Tanjong Pagar Centre was completed. At 280 meters tall, it was also the tallest building in the world outside of North America when it was completed in 1986, surpassing South Korea's 63 Building, which was finished a year earlier. The building is located in the heart of Raffles Place.São Paulo, Brazil's largest city, has an impressive skyline with a remarkable number of buildings. In fact, it's home to the third-highest concentration of buildings in the world, after New York City and Hong Kong. Within the city and its surrounding area, there are 193 buildings that reach over 100 meters in height, most of which are located in the downtown area along Paulista Avenue and the neighborhood of Brooklin. At one time, São Paulo was home to the tallest building in Latin America, the Martinelli Building, which opened in 1929 and stood at a height of 130 meters. The largest building in the city, the Mirante do Vale, is 170 meters tall and was built in 1960. However, today most of the buildings in São Paulo are relatively low, typically reaching no more than 80 meters in height and are mostly residential. The city has laws in place that limit the construction of tall skyscrapers, and the tallest skyscrapers are located in three different areas. Despite this, São Paulo still has a significant number of buildings that are over 90 meters tall, placing it among the top 10 cities in the world with the most buildings of this height.

Boren or United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.? \n\n Passage: United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 US 131 (1948), also known as the Hollywood Antitrust Case of 1948 or the Paramount Case, was a major Supreme Court decision that changed the way movies were made, distributed, and shown in theaters. The case involved movie studios owning their own theaters and requiring exclusive agreements with theaters to show their films. The Supreme Court ruled that this arrangement violated antitrust laws, which prohibit companies from making exclusive deals with other businesses. This decision would have a significant impact on the way Hollywood movies were produced, distributed, and shown in theaters. In the landmark case of Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), the Supreme Court of the United States made a historic decision that changed the way it reviews statutory or administrative classifications based on sex. For the first time, a majority of the Court ruled that these types of classifications are subject to a higher level of scrutiny, known as intermediate scrutiny, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that the Court will carefully examine whether these classifications are fair and reasonable, and whether they serve a compelling government interest.Block booking is a system used by movie studios to sell multiple films to theaters in bulk. This practice was common among major studios from the 1930s until it was illegalized by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1948. Under block booking, independent theater owners were required to purchase large numbers of movies from studios without seeing them first. This allowed studios to divide their movies into two categories: A-list features and second-rate films. By selling both types of movies together, studios could reduce their costs for production and distribution. The part of the system where theaters bought movies without seeing them is called blind bidding. In 1971, a case called Richard John Baker v. Gerald R. Nelson made its way to the Minnesota Supreme Court. The court ruled that a state law that only allowed people of the opposite sex to get married did not violate the US Constitution. Baker appealed, but the US Supreme Court dismissed the appeal in 1972, saying there wasn't enough of a federal question to hear the case. Because the case was reviewed by the US Supreme Court through a legal process called mandatory appellate review, rather than through a request to review the case (called certiorari), the dismissal was considered a decision on the merits. This made the case precedent, but there was debate over how much weight it would carry. In 2013, Minnesota legalized same-sex marriage, and in 2015, the US Supreme Court explicitly overturned Baker in a case called Obergefell v. Hodges, making same-sex marriage legal throughout the US."}], "output": "  The case that came first is Craig v. Boren. It was decided in 1976, while the case of United States v.

These plants belong to the subgenus Oxycoccus of the genus Vaccinium. In Britain, the term cranberry usually refers to a native plant called Vaccinium oxycoccos, while in North America, it can refer to a different plant called Vaccinium macrocarpon. Vaccinium oxycoccos is grown in central and northern Europe, while Vaccinium macrocarpon is grown throughout the northern United States, Canada, and Chile. In some classifications, Oxycoccus is considered a separate genus. Cranberries are typically found in acidic bogs in the cooler regions of the northern hemisphere. Captain Henry Hall was an American from Dennis, Massachusetts who fought in the American Revolutionary War. After the war, he became the first person to successfully cultivate cranberries. This was a significant achievement, as cranberries were a new and unknown fruit in the United States at the time. Hall's innovation helped to establish cranberries as a major crop in the country and paved the way for the industry to grow and thrive.Vice-Admiral Robert Plampin (1762-1834) was a British Navy officer who served in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

The park was designed to have plenty of space for sports and activities, as well as beautiful gardens, a lake for boating, and a wooded area. It was created in the 1920s by the talented landscape architect Thomas Mawson. Salisbury Woodland Gardens is a beautiful open space located in the east of Blackpool, near the intersection of East Park Drive and Woodside Drive. Locals often refer to it as the Woodland Gardens. In 1924, Blackpool Corporation acquired the site and developed it as a shelter belt for the nearby Stanley Park Golf Course.

He plays the Sarod, a traditional Indian stringed instrument. Apratim's unique style of playing, which is inspired by the Dhrupadee Veenkar tradition of Ustad Alauddin Khan's Seni Veenkar Gharana, is characterized by his imaginative and melodic approach to playing. He seamlessly weaves together complex rhythmic patterns and melodic phrases with incredible technical skill and maturity. As an internationally recognized instructor of classical Indian music, Apratim is widely respected for his artistic vision and dedication to preserving the rich traditions of Indian classical music. The sarod (or sarode) is a stringed instrument that's a big deal in Indian classical music. Along with the sitar, it's one of the most popular and important instruments in Hindustani classical music. The sarod has a deep, rich, and introspective sound that's different from the sweet and complex sound of the sitar. One of the things that makes the sarod special is that it has sympathetic strings that give it a really resonant and reverberant quality. It's a fretless instrument, which means it can produce smooth, continuous slides between notes called meend (glissandi) that are important in Indian music.Chander Bari is a Bengali movie released in 2007, directed by Tarun Majumdar. The film revolves around a middle-class joint family, and is based on a Bengali story written by Pracheta Gupta.

It was invented in 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the request of John Philip Sousa, who wanted a more portable and easier-to-play instrument for marching bands. The sousaphone produces sound when the musician moves air through their lips, causing them to vibrate into a large cup-shaped mouthpiece. Unlike the tuba, the sousaphone is curved to fit around the musician's body and has a large, forward-pointing bell that projects the sound ahead. Because of its convenience and sound projection, the sousaphone is widely used in marching bands and other musical genres. Initially made of brass, sousaphones are now also made of lighter materials like fiberglass, which are more practical for musicians."}], "output": "  Sarod**"},

It's part of the Olympic Games and World Championships in Athletics, and is typically held at high-level events. The race is 25 laps around an Olympic-sized track, which is why it's not as common at local track and field meetings because of its length. Unlike the 10K run, which is measured in kilometers, the 10,000 meters is measured in meters, which is why they're considered different events. Harry Prowell, a talented Guyanese long-distance runner, was born on July 10, 1936, and sadly passed away on June 27, 2000.

UK. The magazine is known for its glossy pages and focuses on fashion, shopping, celebrity style, and real-life stories. The editor, Ali Hall, leads the team in bringing readers the latest trends and updates in the fashion world. Chrysalis: A Magazine of Women's Culture was a feminist publication that ran from 1977 to 1980. It was started by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie at the Woman's Building in Los Angeles. Chrysalis grew out of Grimstad and Rennie's work on self-help books, including The New Woman's Survival Catalog and The New Woman's Survival Sourcebook. What made Chrysalis unique was that it combined politics, literature, cultural studies, and art in a magazine that was produced through a collective process. This process was based on the feminist practice of consciousness-raising, which involved bringing people together to share their experiences and ideas. Chrysalis featured some of the most important thinkers and artists of the time, including Audre Lorde, Robin Morgan, Adrienne Rich, Marge Percy, Judy Chicago, Joanna Russ, Lucy Lippard, Mary Daly, Dolores Hayden, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn Hacker, Arlene Raven, and Elizabeth Janeway.

He was a highly influential thinker in the early 20th century and continued to be significant after World War II in the field of continental philosophy. Bergson's ideas had a significant impact on many areas of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Thomas Friedman is a well-known American journalist and author, born on July 20, 1953. He has won the Pulitzer Prize three times, which is a prestigious award in the field of journalism.Henri Bergson's 1903 essay Introduction to Metaphysics explores his idea of reality. Bergson believed that reality is not made up of separate, distinct states, but rather it's a continuous process, similar to the way process philosophy or the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus saw it. Our understanding of reality can't be reduced to simple analysis, as it's constantly changing and can't be fully understood from one perspective alone. Instead, we need to use intuition to fully grasp reality, which Bergson described as immersing ourselves in the object itself. Henri Bergson, a French philosopher, developed a theory of time and consciousness called duration (French: la durée). Bergson felt that earlier philosophers, like Herbert Spencer, didn't fully grasp the nature of time and consciousness. Bergson believed that time is different from what math and science can measure, because it's always changing and can't be captured in a single, fixed moment. For example, when you try to measure a moment, it's already passed. Time is like a moving, incomplete line, and this realization led Bergson to explore the inner workings of the human mind, which he called duration. Duration is a complex and difficult-to-describe concept, and Bergson believed that it could only be understood through a simple intuition of the imagination. Images and ideas can't fully capture the essence of duration, but they can give us a glimpse into its mysterious nature."}], "output": "  Henri Bergson has won more Pulitzer Prizes than Thomas Friedman.

It was founded in 1983 and is based in Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey. In 1999, the company had 60 locations across the United States and was bought by Spencer Gifts, another retailer. Spencer Gifts LLC, doing business as Spencer's, is a well-known retailer with over 600 stores across North America, including the United States and Canada. Their stores specialize in selling fun and unique gifts, like novelty items, gag gifts, clothing, band merchandise, sex toys, home decor, collectible figures, fashion and body jewelry, and Halloween-themed items. In addition to their retail stores, Spencer's also owns and operates Spirit Halloween, a seasonal retailer that focuses on Halloween-related products.A warehouse store or supermarket is a type of food retailer that focuses on offering lower prices than traditional supermarkets. These stores don't require membership fees and have shelves stocked with products in high volumes. When you enter the store, you're led on a logical journey around the store to the checkout area. As you walk in, you're greeted with discounted special buys. Then, you'll find the produce section, followed by the deli at the back of the store. Other departments like the bakery are also included. One of the unique features of these stores is that customers bag their own groceries, which helps reduce costs. Some large grocery chains operate warehouse stores to attract price-conscious customers and maximize their buying power. Examples of such chains include Kroger and Albertsons in the US, while WinCo Foods is a standalone warehouse chain. Unlike other supermarkets like A&P, Safeway, Kroger, or Supervalu, WinCo Foods operates independently. FedMart was a discount department store chain started by Sol Price in San Diego, California. Sol converted a hangar at a nearby airport into the first FedMart store, which opened in 1967 and was only available to government employees who paid a $2 membership fee per family. The first year was a huge success, and over the next 20 years, FedMart grew to 45 stores across several states in the Southwest United States. Some of these stores were previously owned by other retailers, such as White Front or Two Guys. In 1975, Sol sold two-thirds of the chain to a German retail chain called Hugo Mann, and he was forced out of his leadership position the following year.

He studied at Berea College and Purdue University, where he earned his Bachelor's, Master's, and Ph.D. degrees in philosophy. He is the founder and editor-in-chief of the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. He has written or co-written more than ten books on philosophy.   Berea College is a unique liberal arts college located in Berea, Kentucky. It's situated in Madison County, about 35 miles south of Lexington. Founded in 1855, Berea College stands out among other colleges for two main reasons: it provides free education to its students, and it was the first college in the South to be coeducational and racially integrated. What's even more remarkable is that Berea College doesn't charge tuition. In fact, every student who gets admitted receives a four-year scholarship worth $97,200 ($24,300 per year).Altruism is a moral philosophy that values the well-being of others above one's own well-being. This ethical belief holds that the moral goodness of an action depends solely on how it affects other people, regardless of how it affects the individual performing the action. In other words, an action is considered moral if it benefits everyone else more than it benefits the individual.\n\nThere are different versions of altruism, as described by philosophers James Fieser and Auguste Comte. Fieser's version of altruism is summarized in the altruist dictum, which states that an action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable to everyone else than to the individual themselves. Comte's version of altruism, on the other hand, involves living one's life for the benefit of others. People who follow this ethical belief are called altruists. Alice Lloyd College is a four-year liberal arts college located in Pippa Passes, Kentucky. It was founded in 1923 by two women, Alice Spencer Geddes Lloyd and June Buchanan, who were both from out-of-state. At first, the college was called Caney Junior College and was intended to provide education to people in the local Appalachian area. The college became a four-year degree-granting institution in the 1980s and is now accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS)."}], "output": "  Berea College**."},

In 1960, a declaration was made in the Privy Council that established the use of this surname for male-line descendants of the Queen, without any royal titles or styles. However, some descendants of the Queen who hold royal titles may choose to use the Mountbatten-Windsor surname in certain situations where a surname is required. The Mountbatten family is a European royal dynasty that originated as a branch of the German princely Battenberg family. During World War I, some members of the family living in the United Kingdom changed their name to Mountbatten because of growing anti-German sentiment among the British public. The name Mountbatten is actually an English version of the German name Battenberg, which comes from a small town in Hesse, Germany. In the 19th century, a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt (which is a smaller branch of the House of Hesse) was granted the title of count of Battenberg, later changing to prince of Battenberg.The Zulu royal family includes King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, who is the ruler of the Zulus in South Africa, as well as other close relatives and descendants of his great-grandfather, King Mpande. King Mpande was the half-brother of King Shaka, who was a powerful leader who expanded the Zulu kingdom and made it one of the most influential pre-colonial realms in South Africa. King Shaka's policies and conquests helped create the large and powerful Zulu kingdom that exists today. In history and heraldry, a cadet branch refers to the male descendants of a monarch or patriarch's younger sons. In many European and Asian royal families and noble households, the family's wealth, titles, lands, and other assets have traditionally been passed down from the father to his eldest son. However, the younger sons, known as cadets, received less inheritance and had fewer opportunities to pass on their wealth and status to future generations."}], "output": "  The Mountbatten-Windsor family is a European royal dynasty.**"},

During his career, which spanned over 50 years, Vonnegut published 14 novels, three short story collections, five plays, and five works of non-fiction. He is most well-known for his popular and critically acclaimed novel Slaughterhouse-Five, which was published in 1969 and is considered one of his darkly satirical works. Kurt Vonnegut's posthumous collection of short stories and essays, Armageddon in Retrospect, is a poignant look back at war and peace. The book contains previously unpublished writings, including an introduction by Mark Vonnegut and a heartfelt letter from Kurt to his family about his experiences as an American prisoner of war in Nazi Germany during World War II. The book also features Kurt's signature handwritten quotations and rough drawings.

The story follows the family through the war, which broke out in 1936, and the author wrote a sequel called One Million Dead (Un millón de muertos) that continues the story of the family during the war.

It's made up of three ancient kingdoms: Mide, Osraige, and Leinster. After the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century, the areas of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the influence of the Pale, which stretched across both regions. This formed the modern-day province of Leinster. In the past, the kingdoms were divided into counties for administrative and legal purposes. Over time, local government laws have further divided these historic counties.   Patrick Kennedy was an Irish folklorist who lived in County Wexford from early 1801 until his death on March 29, 1873. He was a bookseller by profession, but he is famous for collecting and preserving Irish folktales, particularly those from the Leinster region. These tales are told in a simple, rustic style that reflects the language and dialect of the Irish peasants who lived in the anglicized part of Ireland known as The Pale.

They are similar to the hormone testosterone, which is already in the body. There are two types of anabolic steroids: natural ones, like testosterone, and synthetic ones that are made in a lab and have similar effects to testosterone. These steroids help build muscle, especially in the muscles of the body, and also have effects on other parts of the body, like the voice and body hair. The term anabolic comes from the Greek word anabole, which means something that is thrown up or built up. Anabolic steroids are one of three types of hormone agonists, which means they act like other hormones in the body. The other two types are estrogens (like estradiol) and progestogens (like progesterone). Anabolic steroids are drugs that are made from the male hormone testosterone. They're used for building muscle and getting stronger, both for cosmetic reasons and to improve athletic performance. These drugs work in several ways, including increasing the amount of protein built in muscles and stopping the process of breaking down muscle tissue for energy. Many teens and adults use steroids because they help muscles grow faster than they would on their own.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.Docking is the intentional removal of a part of an animal's body, usually the tail or ears. The term cropping is often used to refer to the removal of ears, while docking is used more commonly to refer to the removal of tails. Some people also use the term tailing to describe this process. The term dock refers to the living flesh on an animal's tail where the tail hairs grow, so docking can also mean removing this flesh. Tensile testing, also known as tension testing, is a fundamental test used in materials science to evaluate the properties of a material under tension. In this test, a sample is stretched until it breaks, and the results are used to determine its strength, elasticity, and other important properties. The test measures the ultimate tensile strength, maximum elongation, and reduction in area of the material. These measurements can also provide information on other properties, such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, and how the material responds to different levels of stretching. The most common type of tensile testing is uniaxial tensile testing, which is used for isotropic materials. For materials that have different properties in different directions, such as composite materials and textiles, biaxial tensile testing is required."}], "output": "  Anabolic steroids.**"},

These plants are known for their thick, fleshy stems and branches that are covered in spines. The name Pachypodium comes from two Latin words: pachus, which means thick, and podion, which means foot or footprint. So, Pachypodium means thick-footed. These plants are part of the dogbane family (Apocynaceae), which is a group of flowering plants that are often found in dry, tropical areas. Stenocereus is a type of cactus that comes from certain parts of Mexico, the United States (Arizona), Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela, and the Dutch Caribbean. The name Stenocereus comes from the Greek words stenos, meaning narrow, and cereus, meaning candle. This genus used to be smaller, but scientists have added species from other genera to it. Stenocereus is closely related to another type of cactus called the peculiar chinoa or chende cactus, which is called Polaskia chende.Coprosma repens is a plant species that belongs to the genus Coprosma and is native to New Zealand.

Nitrogen assimilation is the process of turning inorganic nitrogen compounds found in the environment into organic nitrogen compounds that can be used by living things. Some organisms, like plants, fungi, and certain bacteria, can't make their own nitrogen, so they need to get it from the environment. These organisms can take in nitrate or ammonia from the environment to use for growth and development. Other organisms, like animals, get all the nitrogen they need from the food they eat, which already has organic nitrogen in it."}], "output": "  Yes, both Stenocereus and Pachypodium are capable of being tree-like plants.\n\nStenocereus is a type of cactus that can form trees or shrubs, depending on the species. Some species of Stenocereus can grow up to 10 meters (33 feet) tall and have a spread of up to 3 meters (10 feet) wide, making them appear tree-like.\n\nPachypodium, on the other hand, is a group of plants that are known for their thick, fleshy stems and branches covered in spines. Some species of Pachypodium can grow up to 6 meters (20 feet) tall and have a spread of up to 3 meters (10 feet) wide, also resembling a tree-like shape.\n\nSo, while both Stenocereus and Pachypodium are not true trees (they do not have a true wood or bark), they can still be classified as tree-like plants due to their size and shape."},

On October 31, 1999, all 217 people on board EgyptAir Flight 990 died when the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Massachusetts.

Another goal of the game is to teach players about basic economics and how the economy and government interact. Different editions of the game were created for different countries. The name Poleconomy is a portmanteau of politics and economy.Pashmina is a luxurious type of wool that originated in Kashmir, India.

It's named after George Wythe, a famous American statesman and the Declaration of Independence signer, who also mentored Thomas Jefferson. According to the 2010 census, the town's population was 8,211. Wytheville is situated at the intersection of two major highways, Interstate 77 and Interstate 81, making it a significant transportation hub. During the American Civil War, the town played a strategic role and was attacked twice, in 1863 (Toland's Raid) and 1865 (Stoneman's Raid). Additionally, Wytheville is the birthplace of Edith Bolling Wilson, the wife of President Woodrow Wilson. Interstate 81 (I-81) is a 855-mile highway that runs through several states in the United States. Of all the states, Virginia has the longest portion of I-81, which covers 324.92 miles. In fact, the section of I-81 in Virginia is longer than any other state's section of the highway. The route starts near the Tennessee state line, near the city of Bristol, and ends near the West Virginia state line, near the city of Winchester.Interstate 40 (I-40) is a major highway that runs from California to North Carolina, passing through the states of Tennessee and North Carolina. In North Carolina, I-40 enters the state near the Pigeon River Gorge from Tennessee and runs across the entire state, connecting several cities including Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Durham, and Raleigh. The highway passes through different landscapes, such as the Blue Ridge Mountains, foothills, suburban areas, urban centers, and farmland. With a total length of 423.55 miles, I-40 is the longest interstate highway in North Carolina. There are also five auxiliary Interstates and one business loop in the state that are related to I-40. Interestingly, while the route is labeled as east-west for its entire length, the eastern portion of I-40 (from Hillsboro to Wilmington) follows a more north-south alignment. In New York, there are 32 Interstate Highways, including 9 main routes and 23 auxiliary routes. These highways are maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), but with some exceptions. Unlike in other states, Interstate Highways in New York don't have their numbers directly referenced on signs or in internal documents. Instead, the letter I is added to the number of the route, so you might see I-86 instead of IH-86 on signs. This can sometimes lead to confusion, as there may be duplicate numbers for Interstate Highways and state routes, such as I-86 and NY-86. However, the I suffix helps to distinguish between the two, so you'll see 86I on signs for the Interstate Highway and 86 for the state route."}], "output": "  The population of the town at the intersection of Interstate Highways 77 and the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia is 8,211.**"},

Under this treaty, Afghanistan's leader, Mohammad Yaqub Khan, gave up control of some areas near the border to Britain, while still maintaining full control over the rest of the country. The Second Anglo-Afghan War took place from 1878 to 1880 between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan. This was the second time the British invaded Afghanistan. The war ended with the British emerging victorious against the Afghan rebels, and the Afghans agreed to let the British achieve their political goals as outlined in the Treaty of Gandamak. As a result, most British and Indian soldiers left Afghanistan, but the Afghan tribes were allowed to maintain their internal rule and cultural practices. However, the British also gained control of Afghanistan's foreign relations, ensuring the country's independence from foreign military powers and serving as a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire.The Emirate of Afghanistan (which is today's Islamic Republic of Afghanistan) was a region that existed between Central Asia and South Asia. This emirate began when Dost Mohammed Khan, the leader of the Barakzai dynasty in Kabul, became powerful. The history of the Emirate was affected by the Great Game between Russia and the United Kingdom, who were trying to gain power in Central Asia. This period saw European colonial powers expanding their interests in South Asia. The Emirate fought wars with the Sikh Empire, and in 1842, British-led Indian forces invaded Afghanistan and completely defeated the Afghans. However, the British were defeated in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, and the British regained control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed. The Suzhou Rail Transit Line 2 is the main north-south line that runs through the city. The first phase of the line is 26.557 kilometers long, with 6.57 kilometers elevated, 19.146 kilometers underground, and 0.67 kilometers open wide. The line starts at Suzhou North Railway Station and ends at Baodaiqiao South Station near Baodai Bridge. The line passes through five districts of Suzhou and has 22 stations, including 17 underground and 5 overhead. The first phase of the line began operating on December 28, 2013."}], "output": "  The Treaty of Gandamak officially ended the first phase of the military conflict between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan from 1878 to 1880.**"},

A 26-year-old man named Chris Harper-Mercer, who was a student at the school, shot and killed an assistant professor and eight students in a classroom. Seven to nine other people were injured in the attack. The local police responded quickly and engaged Harper-Mercer in a brief shooting. However, he was injured and later died by shooting himself in the head. This mass shooting was the deadliest in Oregon's recent history.In May 1945, after World War II ended in Yugoslavia, a mass killing of prisoners of war (POWs) took place in Tezno, near Maribor. The killings were carried out by units of the Yugoslav Partisans and resulted in the deaths of many POWs from the Independent State of Croatia (NDH).

In its heyday in 1929, Bolton was home to 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works, making it one of the world's largest and most productive centers of cotton spinning. However, the British cotton industry declined significantly after World War I, and by the 1980s, cotton manufacturing had almost come to a standstill in Bolton.

This process happens when the air is heated and expands, and then cools and contracts. Throughout history, different types of hot air engines have been developed, including open-cycle engines like those invented by Sir George Cayley and John Ericsson, and closed-cycle engines like the one invented by Robert Stirling. Unlike internal combustion engines and steam engines, hot air engines use the expansion and contraction of air to generate power, rather than burning fuel or boiling water. Sir George Cayley was a very important English engineer who lived from 1773 to 1857. He is considered one of the most important people in the history of flying machines. Many people think he was the first person to understand how flying works and the first to use science to study flying. He is often called the first true scientific aerial investigator.Elliott J. Stoddard invented and patented two versions of the Stoddard engine, one in 1919 and the other in 1933. These engines are classified as external combustion engines, which means they use an external heat source to generate power. The engine has valves that control the flow of a single-phase gaseous working fluid (such as hot air) inside the engine. Initially, the internal working fluid was air, but modern versions may use other gases like helium or hydrogen. Charles Stephen Boreham was a New Zealand shearer and trade unionist born in Richmond, Tasmania, Australia on December 19, 1857."}], "output": "  Sir George Cayley**."},

Despite being part of the Working Group in dog shows like Crufts, the Leonberger is not included in the World Dog Show. The Basset Hound is a type of dog that belongs to the hound family. Originally bred for hunting hares, Basset Hounds have a strong sense of smell and can track their prey by following the scent on the ground. In fact, their ability to smell is almost as good as the Bloodhound's, which is the best of any breed. There are six recognized Basset-type breeds in France, where the Basset Hound originated.Dog Tales is a 1958 animated cartoon from Warner Brothers that features a series of funny blackout gags involving dogs. In one of the gags, a Doberman pinscher is seen viciously biting an overweight U.S. Army private who is also named Doberman (a reference to a character from a popular TV show). In another gag, the narrator can't decide whether a dog is a pointer or a setter, and then finally shows a picture of a point-setter. The cartoon also includes a basset hound who thinks she's a TV star, just like a popular dog character from a TV show at the time. We also learn about the unusual breed of a Newfoundland puppy's grandfather and see a great dane play the piano. Some of the animation in the cartoon was reused from other Warner Brothers cartoons, including one featuring Charlie Dog, who makes a cameo in his final appearance in a Warner Bros. cartoon.

In the article, Freud argues that it's no coincidence that some of the most influential works of literature, including Oedipus Rex, Hamlet, and The Brothers Karamazov, all deal with the theme of parricide. Freud believes that Dostoevsky's epilepsy is connected to this theme in his work. Oedipus Rex, also known as Oedipus the King, is an ancient Greek play written by Sophocles around 429 BC. The original title in Greek was simply Oedipus, but it was later renamed Oedipus Tyrannus to distinguish it from another play called Oedipus at Colonus. In ancient times, the term tyrant referred to a ruler, but it didn't necessarily have a negative connotation.In 1899, Sigmund Freud wrote a book called The Interpretation of Dreams (German: Die Traumdeutung). In this book, Freud introduced his theory of the unconscious mind and how it relates to dream interpretation. He also discussed what would later become known as the Oedipus complex. Freud revised the book at least eight times, and in the third edition, he added a section that explained dream symbolism in a very literal way, influenced by Wilhelm Stekel. Freud believed that this work was a once-in-a-lifetime breakthrough in understanding the hidden meanings of dreams. In 1988, a biography called Freud: A Life for Our Time was written by historian Peter Gay about the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. This book builds upon new information that has come to light since a previous biography, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud by Ernest Jones, was published in 1953. While the book has received praise, some authors have criticized it because they are skeptical of psychoanalysis."}], "output": "  Literature.**"},

It is most commonly seen in the early evening hours after brief periods of rain in the afternoon. The name Gollum comes from a character in J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Lord of the Rings. J.R.R. Tolkien, a renowned English author and scholar, wrote The Lord of the Rings, an epic fantasy novel that has become a beloved classic. Initially intended as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings grew into a much larger and more complex work over time.

The book contains 595 problems divided into 17 chapters and is primarily focused on basic arithmetic using the abacus. This book was a primary source of information for scholars studying mathematics in China's mathematical tradition. Six years after publishing Suanfa tongzong, Cheng Dawei released another book called Suanfa zuanyao (A Compendium of Calculating Methods), which mostly duplicated the content of four chapters of the first book with some reorganization. The popularity of Suanfa tongzong was so great that it led to an increase in the cost of paper and the publication of pirated copies with errors. This prompted Cheng Dawei to release an abridged version of the book. Gollum is a fictional character created by J.R.R. Tolkien, a famous author of fantasy stories. He was first introduced in Tolkien's 1937 book The Hobbit, and later became a key character in the sequel, The Lord of the Rings.

They're best known for their hit song Barbie Girl from 1997, which made them famous all over the world. The group was formed in 1989 and released three albums: Aquarium in 1997, Aquarius in 2000, and Megalomania in 2011. According to estimates, they've sold around 33 million albums and singles, making them the most successful Danish band of all time. In 2002, Mattel filed a lawsuit against MCA Records over the song Barbie Girl by the band Aqua. This was because the song was released in 1997 and Mattel felt that it was too similar to one of its popular children's songs. The case went back and forth between the court and the parties involved, but ultimately, the case was dismissed.Daze is a Danish music band that was popular in the late 1990s.

Their music style is similar to the Danish pop band Aqua, and they are known for their upbeat and catchy tunes. Super Heroes was published in Scandinavia by Sony Music and later released in other countries through Columbia Records and Epic Records.

Gibb or Reynolds v. Sims? \n\n Passage: In the landmark Supreme Court case Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the Court ruled that state legislative districts must be roughly equal in population when electing any chamber of a state legislature. This decision overturned the traditional role of state senates, which allowed rural areas to balance out the influence of large cities. The case was brought by a voter in Alabama named M.O. Sims, who argued that the unequal distribution of population in Alabama's state legislative districts unfairly gave more power to urban areas. The ruling had a significant impact on both northern and southern states, as many had failed to reapportion their legislatures in line with changes in state population. In the landmark case of Selle v. Gibb (1984), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit established an important principle regarding the doctrine of striking similarities. The court ruled that while copying must be proven by showing both access and substantial similarity, if there is no evidence of access, striking similarities can raise an inference of copying. This is done by showing that the similarities between the two works could not have been the result of independent creation, coincidence, or a common source. In other words, striking similarity alone is not enough to infer access, but if the similarities are so striking that they preclude the possibility of independent creation, it can raise an inference that the works were copied.The first case to be heard by the United States Supreme Court was West v. Barnes, 2 U.S. 401 (1791), which was the first Supreme Court decision ever made. This case was significant because it introduced the practice of oral arguments in the Supreme Court. The case was argued on August 2, 1791, and the decision was made on August 3, 1791. However, there were two other cases that were docketed with the Court around the same time, but they were settled before the Court could hear them: Van Staphorst v. Maryland (1791) and Collet v. Collet (1791). Unfortunately, the justices' full opinions in West v. Barnes were not published in the Supreme Court Reporter, but instead were summarized in newspapers at the time. In the Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd case, the House of Lords ruled on the concept of qualified privilege in English defamation law. This refers to situations where the publication of defamatory statements is allowed in the public interest, even though it may harm the reputation of the person being criticized. The case involved a newspaper publishing a statement that was potentially defamatory, but the court ruled that the publication was justified because it was in the public interest."}], "output": "  Reynolds v.

The term originated in the world of Italian opera, where impresarios were responsible for hiring musicians, singers, and other performers, as well as designing costumes and sets, all while taking financial risks. In the 18th and 19th centuries, impresarios were often noble amateurs who ran theatres, and they played a key role in organizing the annual opera season. Impresarios were known to be highly involved in the creative process, and they often produced and composed their own works. For example, Antonio Vivaldi acted as both impresario and composer, managing seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice and creating operas such as Orlando finto pazzo.\n\nI hope this helps!

A freight forwarder, also known as a non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC), is like a coordinator for shipments. They help individuals or businesses get their goods from the manufacturer or producer to the final destination, such as a store or customer. The forwarder doesn't move the goods themselves, but instead works with different carriers (like trucking companies, airlines, or railroads) to get the goods there. Think of it like a travel agent for shipments! They contract with these carriers to move the goods and often use multiple modes of transportation (like truck, plane, and train) to get the job done. For instance, a forwarder might arrange for cargo to be picked up from a factory and transported to an airport by truck, then flown to the final destination and delivered to a customer's doorstep by another truck."}], "output": "  Impresario.**"},

These shrubs are evergreen and can grow up to 3 feet tall and wide. The leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems and are shaped like lancelets, with a pointed tip and a serrated edge. In the spring, the young leaves are often brightly colored. The flowers are bell-shaped and white or pink, growing in clusters up to 5 inches long. After the flowers bloom, the shrubs produce woody capsules that split open to release many small seeds. Phlebodium is a small group of ferns that contains only two to four species, and these species are found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These ferns are closely related to another genus called Polypodium, and they used to be classified under that genus too.The genus Sinopieris belongs to the family Pieridae, which means they are a group of butterflies. Sinopieris can be found in several countries, including Nepal, Tibet, Yunnan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan. In the past, all six species of Sinopieris were classified under the genus Pieris. However, scientists have found that Sinopieris and Pieris have some distinct differences in the pattern of veins on their wings. Specifically, Sinopieris has a light grey or blackish band that covers a portion of the wing, while Pieris has either a single black spot or a pair of black spots on the same area. Additionally, Sinopieris does not have any black spots on its hindwings, while Pieris does.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

The bridge was built in 1889 by Charles A. Allen, a civil engineer for the city of Worcester, at the request of Edwin Bartlett, a local textile mill owner. The bridge is 30 feet long and 42 feet wide, with an elliptical arch reaching a height of 13 feet above the river. The facing of the bridge is made of rough-cut granite that has been fixed with mortar, while the granite stones that make up the arch have been precisely worked. The bridge has parapet walls made of large granite slabs that are 4.5 feet, 2 feet wide, and 1 foot thick.   Worcester is a city located in Massachusetts, United States. It is the county seat of Worcester County and was named after Worcester, England. According to the 2010 Census, the city's population was 181,045, making it the second most populous city in New England after Boston. Worcester is situated approximately 40 miles west of Boston, 50 miles east of Springfield, and 40 miles north of Providence. Due to its central location in Massachusetts, Worcester is often referred to as the Heart of the Commonwealth. This nickname is reflected in the city's official symbol, a heart, which may also have roots in local lore about the invention of the mass-produced Valentine's Day card in the city.The Sutliff Bridge is a historic bridge located in Sutliff, a small community near Lisbon, Iowa. It was built in 1897 and 1898 at a cost of around $12,000. The original engineer for the bridge was J.R. Sheely. In 1983, a modern replacement bridge was built over the Cedar River, and the old bridge was slated for demolition. However, it was later saved and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Although the bridge was a popular spot for both locals and visitors, it was damaged by massive floods in 2008. The floods caused one of the bridge's spans to be washed away, and it is estimated that it will cost around $1.7 million to repair it. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed to help fund the repairs, with FEMA providing most of the money and the local government and donations covering the rest. The bridge was reconstructed by VJ Engineering of Coralville, Iowa, and construction was completed by Iowa Bridge and Culvert of Washington, Iowa. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held in October 2012 to reopen the bridge to the public after four years of closure. The Gardnerville Branch Jail is a historic jail located at 1440 Courthouse Street in Gardnerville, Nevada. The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915. Before 1910, the county had no jail, so prisoners were held in a local judge's granary, which was not suitable for housing prisoners. The community petitioned the county to build a new jail, but some local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, opposed the move, thinking Gardnerville was trying to take over the county seat. Despite these protests, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners even before it was finished, as the Genoa jail burned down and one prisoner was temporarily chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail."}], "output": "  Sure!

The rebels were frustrated with the British rule, which had been in place for many years, and there had been several isolated uprisings against them. In 1857, these uprisings came together and gained momentum, with many people feeling that they could overthrow the colonial rule. Although the rebellion was not centrally coordinated, it had a sense of national unity and purpose, which made it seem like a much larger and more significant event than it actually was. According to Niger's Constitution of 1999, the country is committed to protecting the basic human rights outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, human rights groups both within and outside Niger have expressed concerns about the government, military, police, and traditional practices that go against the 1999 constitution. During the period of French colonial rule (1900-1960) and after Niger gained independence in 1960, citizens had limited political rights and lived under arbitrary government power. Although things have improved since Niger returned to civilian rule, there are still criticisms about the state of human rights in the country."}], "output": "  J.G.

The show is about a special group of creatures called gargoyles who turn to stone during the day and live in medieval Scotland. After being petrified for a thousand years, the gargoyles are awakened in modern-day New York City and become the city's secret protectors at night. Gargoyles the Movie: The Heroes Awaken is a direct-to-video animated film produced by The Walt Disney Company. This movie is actually a collection of five pilot episodes from the animated TV series Gargoyles, edited together to create a single feature-length film. Due to time constraints, some scenes were removed from the original episodes and rearranged for the film. Additionally, some dialogue was changed to make the movie flow better. The episodes were produced and aired in 1994, and the movie was released on laserdisc and VHS in February 1995. Since the pilot episodes have been released as part of Season 1 of Gargoyles on DVD, it's unlikely that this feature will be released separately again.Desert kites are structures built in the Middle East to trap and hunt wild animals. The Bedouin people have called them The Works of the Old Men and they can be found across the deserts of Syria, Jordan, southern Israel, and Saudi Arabia. These structures are made of long walls made of rocks that come together at a narrow neck, creating a small enclosed space. The walls can stretch for hundreds of meters and are best seen from the air. They were given their name by pilots who first spotted them in the 1920s, and over 2,000 have been identified in Jordan and Syria. While some have been dated to be around 3-5 thousand years old, newer studies suggest that they are actually much younger, around 1,000-2,000 years old. This means that the mass hunting did not occur in prehistory, but rather during a later period when people were already growing most of their food. There is also evidence of rock art near some of the kites, which suggests that the hunt was a large social effort done by people from several settlements and may have had religious significance.

The most common type of imprest system is the petty cash system. The key characteristic of an imprest system is that a fixed amount of money is set aside, which is then used to pay for small expenses. When the money in the imprest system is depleted, it is replenished from another account, such as a bank account. For example, if the petty cash system is depleted, it can be replenished by cashing a cheque drawn on a bank account. Brian Bethell created the character W.

The event is broadcast live and only available through pay-per-view (PPV) and the WWE Network. The name Extreme Rules comes from the fact that most matches are contested under hardcore wrestling regulations, which were originally used by the defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion. The event was first held in 2009, but its theme started with its predecessor, One Night Stand, which was promoted in 2005 and 2006 as an ECW reunion show. In 2007, WWE promoted the show as one of its own regular PPV events and kept the ECW concept of Extreme Rules matches. In 2009, WWE renamed the One Night Stand event to WWE Extreme Rules. The 2009 event was noted as a direct continuation of the One Night Stand chronology, but the 2010 event was promoted as only the second event under a new chronology that is no longer a direct continuation of the One Night Stand events. Starting in 2010, Extreme Rules was moved from June to late April/early May to replace Backlash as the post-WrestleMania pay-per-view event. For 2013, the event was scheduled to take place in mid-May and replace Over the Limit, which was moved to October before being discontinued that year. The event will return to the early June slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar and will be a Raw-exclusive pay-per-view event.

Channing was chosen as one of eleven All-American halfbacks for Princeton University in 1889. When the Spanish-American War started in 1898, Channing joined Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, which made Roosevelt proud to have many Ivy League football players in the group. Channing later went into the mining business and worked for the Whitney family. In the 1920s, he formed a partnership with his friend Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, and they started the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company in Flin Flon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Channing was the company's president until he passed away in 1961. Cornelius Vanderbilt C.V. Whitney, born on February 20, 1899, and passing away on December 13, 1992, was a successful American businessman, film producer, writer, philanthropist, polo player, and government official.

He was one of the first designers to introduce Scandinavian design to the United States, which became an exemplar of the style. Risom was born on May 8, 1916, and passed away on December 9, 2016, leaving behind a legacy of timeless and elegant designs. Scandinavian design is a design movement that started in the 1950s in the five Nordic countries of Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark. Although the term Scandinavia only refers to the three kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, people often use it to refer to all five countries. This design style is known for being simple, minimalist, and functional. It emerged as a response to the ornate and elaborate designs that were popular at the time, and it has since become a symbol of modern, clean, and efficient design.In 2003, Charles Lim Chee Pang, the founder of Peliontech, introduced a new term called Workflow Resource Planning (WRP) to describe a new type of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. Unlike conventional ERP software, which relies on a data entry and processing model, WRP software integrates workflow functionality into its core design. This was a significant innovation, as it allowed for more efficient and streamlined business processes. Prior to this, Lotus Notes was a pioneer in workflow systems, but it fell out of favor in the early 2000s. Charles Lim drew inspiration from Lotus Notes and combined its workflow ideas with ERP systems to create Radix WRP, a new class of ERP software that combines workflow manageability with traditional ERP features. In the NTFS file system, a symbolic link (symlink) is a special object that points to another object. The object being pointed to is called the target. Symlinks are designed to be invisible to users, so they appear like regular files or directories. You can treat them the same way you would any other file or directory. In fact, you can even create symbolic links to directories or volumes (called junction points or mount points) with NTFS 3.0 and later versions. However, the feature wasn't available to user-mode applications until NTFS 3.1, which was introduced with Windows XP. But you could make it work in user mode by using third-party filter drivers like Masatoshi Kimura's open-source code_1 driver. Starting with Windows Vista, the functionality is available to user-mode applications by default through the ntfs.sys file."}], "output": "  Design.**"},

When light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometers enters our eyes, we see blue. Blues with a higher frequency (shorter wavelength) appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency (longer wavelength) gradually appear more green. Pure blue, with a wavelength of 470 nanometers, is right in the middle. In painting and traditional color theory, blue is one of the three main colors of pigments, along with red and yellow. When you mix red and blue together, you get violet, and mixing blue and yellow creates green. Blue is also a primary color in the RGB color model used to make all the colors on a TV or computer screen. Innocent Records was created by EMI to cater to the pop side of their Virgin Records label. After the success of the Spice Girls, Virgin decided to focus more on pop music and hired Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records (known for helping Take That become a successful act) to launch his own label within Virgin. Goldsmith signed artists such as Billie Piper and Martine McCutcheon, as well as some dance acts like Todd Terry. The label did well in the mid-2000s with acts like Atomic Kitten and Blue selling Platinum records.The ProPhoto RGB color space, also called ROMM RGB (Reference Output Medium Metric), is a special type of RGB color space developed by Kodak. It's designed for use with photographic output, and it has a much larger color gamut than other RGB color spaces. In fact, it covers over 90% of all possible colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of real-world colors that have been documented. The ProPhoto RGB color space also has special primaries that help reduce hue rotations when converting colors to non-linear tone scales. However, one downside is that it can't represent around 13% of colors that don't exist or are invisible. The YCoCg color model is a way of creating a color space by transforming an associated RGB color space into three values: a luma value (denoted as Y), and two chroma values called chrominance green (Cg) and chrominance orange (Co). This color model is commonly used in video and image compression systems like H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, HEVC, JPEG XR, and Dirac because it's easy to compute, has good compression properties, and can be easily converted to and from RGB with fewer bits than other color models."}], "output": "  Blue.** Platinum sales."},

Additionally, small, microscopic gours may form on the horizontal surfaces of the rimstone. These formations can create beautiful terraces that stretch for hundreds of feet, with some single basins reaching lengths of up to 200 feet, as seen in Tham Xe Biang Fai in Laos.

The film features contributions from several notable figures, including writers Alan Moore and Iain Sinclair, the torch singer Claudia Barton, and the musician Jem Finer. The Abbey Church of Waltham Holy Cross and St Lawrence is the main church in the town of Waltham Abbey, Essex, England. It has been a place of worship since the 7th century. The current building was mainly constructed in the early 12th century and features Norman architecture. To the east of the existing church, there are remains of a large expansion project that was started in 1177, after the abbey was re-founded. In the Middle Ages, Waltham Abbey was one of the largest and most important religious buildings in England, attracting many pilgrims. Unfortunately, it was closed in 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but it continues to be an active parish church for the town today.Tostig Godwinson was an important leader in England during the 11th century. He was an Earl of Northumbria and the brother of King Harold Godwinson. Unfortunately, Tostig had a difficult relationship with his brother and was eventually exiled from England. After being exiled, Tostig supported a foreign king named Harald Hardrada who was trying to take over England. Tostig fought alongside Harald at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, but they were both defeated and killed. Edith the Fair, also known as Edyth the Gentle Swan (Old English: Ealdgȳð Swann hnesce), was the first wife of King Harold Godwinson. The nickname Swanneck or Swan-Neck comes from a folk etymology that misinterpreted her name in Old English as swann hnecca, which actually means Gentle Swan. She is sometimes confused with Ealdgyth, the daughter of Earl Ælfgar of Mercia, who was also queen during Harold's reign."}], "output": "  Essex.**"},

She turned professional in 1998 and has had a successful career, winning the 2010 French Open singles title, becoming the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam event in singles. This was a significant achievement, as she was able to defeat other top players to win the title. She also reached the finals of the French Open in 2011, but lost to another player. Schiavone's career high ranking is world No. 4, which she achieved on January 31, 2011.

In fact, they became the first two players, male or female, to play in four consecutive Grand Slam singles finals from 2002 to 2003. Serena famously won all four of these finals to complete what is known as a Serena Slam. Overall, between 2000 and 2016, the sisters collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles, with Venus winning five and Serena winning seven. In 2001, they became the fifth pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam. At the time, Venus and Serena were just 20 and 19 years old, respectively. They have since gone on to win two more Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics. The sisters also won four consecutive Grand Slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon to 2010 Roland Garros, which propelled them to become the co-number one doubles players on June 7, 2010. Two weeks later, Serena held the number one singles ranking, while Venus was right behind her at number two in singles. Their most recent Grand Slam doubles titles came at the 2012 Wimbledon and 2016 Wimbledon events.

When you include its longest tributaries, the Darling River system measures a total of 2,844 kilometers, making it the longest river system in Australia. Frenchmans Creek is a small river that flows into the Darling River in western New South Wales. It's about 7.5 kilometers long and starts at an elevation of 54 meters south of Pooncarie, New South Wales. The creek flows down to the Darling River at an elevation of 48 meters.Cow Creek is a tributary of the Missouri River located in north central Montana, about 35 miles long. It originates in the southern foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains in western Blaine County and flows east and then south, joining the Missouri River about 25 miles northeast of Winifred. The creek flows through a canyon that runs along the Missouri Breaks, a rugged and eroded region that stretches out from the river. This canyon provided a pathway for travelers to move between the Montana plains north of the river and the central and southern plains. This route was used by buffalo and Native American tribes for centuries before the arrival of steamboats on the Missouri River. During the steamboat era, the mouth of Cow Creek became a river landing and freighting depot, and a trail led from there to Fort Benton. In 1877, the Nez Perce Indian Tribe had several skirmishes along Cow Creek, including the Battle of Cow Island, and later made a fateful decision to slow down rather than push on to Canada. Today, modern highways have bypassed Cow Creek, and the buffalo and nomadic Indian are gone. The creek is now a remote and isolated spot in the vast Montana Missouri Breaks region.

She was born in Lithuania in 1909 and later became a naturalized American citizen. Throughout her life, Wigmore wrote many books and gave lectures on her beliefs, which emphasized the importance of a holistic approach to health and wellness. She believed that eating raw, living foods was the key to optimal health and longevity. Wigmore's work and teachings had a significant impact on the field of holistic health and continue to inspire many people to this day. Ann Wigmore invented and promoted a type of grain water called Rejuvelac.  Holistic dentistry, also known as biological dentistry, alternative dentistry, unconventional dentistry, or biocompatible dentistry, is a type of dentistry that focuses on treating dental problems in a holistic way, taking into account a patient's overall physical, emotional, and spiritual health. This approach is similar to complementary and alternative medicine. Holistic dentists often oppose the use of certain dental materials, such as amalgam, and use nonsurgical methods to treat gum disease. They also believe that root canals can harm a patient's overall health by allowing bacteria to spread throughout the body. Many holistic dentists also disagree with water fluoridation. In summary, holistic dentistry is a type of dentistry that considers the whole person, not just their teeth, when providing dental care. Elizabeth A.

This influential work of scientific literature examines human sexual behavior by drawing on information from a staggering 191 different cultures around the world. The authors also compare human sexuality to that of other animals, with a particular focus on primates. Hailed as a classic in its field, this book served as the foundation for later research by Masters and Johnson. In 1977, Ford and Beach published a revised edition of the book, titled Human Sexuality in Four Perspectives, which further explores the complexities of human sexual behavior. The research team of William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson was a groundbreaking group that studied the human sexual response and developed ways to diagnose and treat sexual problems from 1957 to the 1990s. This team, known as the Masters and Johnson research team, made significant contributions to the field of sexual medicine through their innovative research and work.William L.

To protect his sources, Shirer disguised their identities in his diary. The material he collected in his diary was later used in his book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, which became a landmark work on the subject.

Chimaji Appa was a skilled military commander who played a crucial role in liberating the western coast of India from Portuguese rule. His most notable achievement was capturing the Vasai fort from the Portuguese in a fiercely fought battle, which marked the peak of his career.

Balaji left his hometown in search of work and became a mercenary trooper under various Maratha generals in the western ghats. According to Kincaid & Parasnis, Balaji joined the Maratha administration during the reign of Chhatrapati Sambhaji or the regency of his brother, Rajaram.

Its roots go back to the Charles City-Henrico County Regiment of Militia, which was founded in 1652. During the French and Indian War, the regiment was led by Colonel George Washington. The regiment fought in several important battles, including the Battle of Great Bridge, the New York Campaign, the Battle of Trenton, the Battle of Princeton, the Battle of Brandywine, the Battle of Germantown, the Battle of Monmouth, and the Battle of Stony Point. Unfortunately, most of the regiment was captured at Charleston, South Carolina, on May 12, 1780, by the British, and the regiment was formally disbanded on November 15, 1783. However, the 276th Engineer Battalion is the successor to the 1st Virginia Regiment, carrying on its legacy. The Battle of Great Bridge took place on December 9, 1775, in the area of Great Bridge, Virginia, during the early stages of the American Revolutionary War. The victory of the colonial Virginia militia forces led to the departure of the British governor, Lord Dunmore, and the end of any remaining British control over Virginia. This event marked an important turning point in the war.The 5th Virginia Regiment was formed on December 28, 1775, in Richmond, Virginia, to serve in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. The regiment fought in several important battles, including the Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, and the Siege of Charleston. In 1779, the 5th Virginia Regiment was combined with the 3rd Virginia Regiment. Two of its commanders were General William Russell and Colonel Josiah Parker. The 9th Virginia Regiment was created in the Virginia State Troops on January 11, 1776. It was organized into seven companies of soldiers from eastern Virginia between February 5 and March 16, 1776. The regiment was later adopted into the Continental Army on May 31, 1776. During the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Germantown, the 9th Virginia Regiment fought bravely, but sadly, over 400 of its soldiers were captured by the British at Germantown after becoming separated from the rest of General Nathanael Greene's division. The regiment was then surrounded and attacked from all sides, leading to its surrender near Kelly's Hill. As a result, the 9th Virginia Regiment was consolidated with the 1st Virginia Regiment on May 12, 1779, and the combined unit was designated as the 1st Virginia Regiment.

Hlín appears in old Norse poems, including the Poetic Edda and kennings found in skaldic poetry. Some people believe that Hlín might actually be another name for Frigg. Norse mythology is the collection of stories and legends that came from the beliefs of the North Germanic people. These stories were passed down from before the time when the Scandinavian people became Christian, and they continued to be told and retold throughout history. Norse mythology includes tales of many gods, beings, and heroes that were described in ancient manuscripts, found in archaeological artifacts, and passed down through oral tradition. In other words, it's the body of mythology that came from the North Germanic people's pagan beliefs and continued to evolve even after they became Christian.Frigg gas field is a natural gas field located on Norwegian block 25/1 in the North Sea, which borders the United Kingdom.

Some scholars believe that these sources may refer to the same figure, but there is debate about whether Eir was originally a healing goddess or a valkyrie. Some have also suggested that Eir may be a form of the goddess Frigg, and there are similarities between Eir and the Greek goddess Hygieia."}], "output": "  The goddess associated with Frigg in Norse mythology is Eir.

American and Filipino forces battled against Japanese troops in the capital city of Manila, resulting in the deaths of over 100,000 civilians and the complete destruction of the city. This was the worst urban fighting in the Pacific during the war, and the Japanese committed horrific acts of violence against Filipino civilians. In addition to the massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed important historical and cultural landmarks that date back to the city's founding. The battle marked a significant turning point in the war, as it ended the nearly three-year Japanese military occupation of the Philippines (1942-1945) and was a key victory for General Douglas MacArthur in the campaign to retake the country. The Second Battle of Guam took place from July 21 to August 10, 1944, and was a crucial event in World War II.

The original title of the album was Virgo's Fool, but Warner Bros. changed it without Morrison's permission. Morrison started recording the album in early 1970 in a small church in Woodstock, New York, and then booked A&R Studios in New York City to produce two sessions of songs that were included on the album.Van Morrison, a Northern Irish singer-songwriter, wrote a hit song called Domino as a tribute to the famous New Orleans R&B singer and pianist, Fats Domino. This song is the opening track on Morrison's fourth studio album, titled His Band and the Street Choir. Morrison was deeply inspired by Domino's music and wanted to pay homage to him through this song. Van Morrison's song Blue Money was a hit in the 1970s. It was on an album called His Band and the Street Choir and reached #23 on the US music charts. The song was released as a single in the UK in June 1971, and it had two different songs on the B-side depending on where you were.

He served as a state representative for the Democratic party in Michigan and was also the mayor of Detroit from 2002 to 2008. Unfortunately, Kilpatrick resigned as mayor in September 2008 after being convicted of lying under oath and obstructing justice. He was sentenced to four months in jail, but served only 99 days before being released on probation. In 2009, the mayoral election in Detroit took place on May 5th. Before that, there was a primary election on February 24th to fill the vacancy left when the previous mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, resigned.Jane Marum Roush was appointed by Governor Terry McAuliffe as an interim Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia in July 2015. At the time, she was supposed to serve until the end of the next session of the Virginia General Assembly, which was 30 days after her appointment. However, the General Assembly didn't elect her to a full 12-year term before their special session ended. The Constitution of Virginia says that the legislature can't adjourn for more than 3 days without the other chamber's consent, but the Senate adjourned without the House of Delegates' approval. This means that it's unclear if the Governor could fill the vacancy created by Roush's original interim appointment when it expired on September 16, 2015. The Governor claimed that the legislature was not in session, so he purported to reappoint Roush for a second interim term. If this second interim appointment was valid, it would have expired on February 12, 2016, 30 days after the regular session of the General Assembly began. However, the legality of the second interim appointment is still uncertain. The city of Calgary in Alberta, Canada has held municipal elections every year until 1923, when the election cycle changed to a two-year term for the mayor. From 1971 onwards, the mayoral term was extended to three years. The elections for councillors and aldermen used to be held annually as well, but in 1914, the terms were switched to two-year overlapping terms, with half of each council up for election every year. In 1971, the aldermanic elections aligned with the mayoral elections and were also extended to three years. In 1976, the number of wards increased to 14, with one councillor representing each ward for a three-year term. In 2010, the city council voted to change the title of the position from alderman to councillor, which took effect in the 2013 election.

This was notable because other bands in Iceland at that time sticked to more traditional styles. In fact, Tappi Tíkarrass was the first serious music project of Björk Guðmundsdóttir, who would go on to become a well-known singer in her own right. INXS was an Australian rock band formed in 1977 in Sydney, New South Wales. The band started playing covers in Western Australian pubs and clubs, sometimes performing their original music. The main members were Andrew Farriss (keyboardist and composer), Jon Farriss (drummer), Tim Farriss and Kirk Pengilly (guitarists), Garry Gary Beers (bassist), and Michael Hutchence (vocalist and lyricist). For 20 years, Hutchence was the lead vocalist of INXS, known for his charismatic stage presence and good looks. Initially, the band was known for its new wave/pop style, but they later developed a harder, more funk-inspired sound with a mix of rock and dance elements.Bitið fast í vitið (which means Bite Hard In Your Mind in Icelandic) is the debut EP of the Icelandic punk/pop band Tappi Tíkarrass.

It's part of a system in the body called the renin-angiotensin system, which is a key target for drugs that raise blood pressure. Angiotensin also triggers the release of another hormone called aldosterone from the adrenal gland. Aldosterone helps retain sodium in the kidneys, which in turn raises blood pressure even more. So, in summary, angiotensin causes blood vessels to narrow, raises blood pressure, and triggers the release of a hormone that helps retain sodium in the body, leading to even higher blood pressure. Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium levels in the body. It's made in the adrenal cortex, specifically in the zona glomerulosa, and helps conserve sodium in the kidneys, salivary glands, sweat glands, and colon. Aldosterone does this by binding to receptors in the nephron, which is the part of the kidney that filters blood. This binding influences the amount of sodium and potassium that is reabsorbed or excreted by the kidney, which can affect fluid retention, blood pressure, and blood volume. If aldosterone levels are out of balance, it can lead to cardiovascular and renal disease. It's important to note that aldosterone has the opposite effect of atrial natriuretic hormone, which is produced by the heart and helps regulate sodium levels in the body.The sodium-chloride symporter, also known as Na-Cl cotransporter or NCC, is a specialized transport system in the kidney that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from the fluid in the kidney tubules into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule. This process is important for maintaining proper sodium and chloride levels in the body. The Na-Cl cotransporter belongs to a family of transport proteins called SLC12 cotransporters, which use a special mechanism to move electroneutral (meaning they don't change the overall charge of the molecules they transport). The gene for the Na-Cl cotransporter in humans is located on chromosome 16 at position 16q13. In the kidney, there's a part called the loop of Henle (also called Henle's loop, Henle loop, nephron loop, or its Latin name ansa nephroni). This part is found within a tiny structure called a nephron, which is responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the body's blood. The loop of Henle connects the proximal convoluted tubule (a longer, twisty tube) to the distal convoluted tubule (a shorter, twisty tube). The loop of Henle is named after the German anatomist who first discovered it, Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle. Its main job is to create a concentration gradient in the middle part of the kidney, which helps the body get rid of waste more efficiently."}], "output": "  The hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron is aldosterone.**"},

The Court decided that the Mississippi University for Women's policy of only admitting female students violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In other words, the Court found that the university's policy of excluding male students from attending the institution was unfair and discriminatory. In the Supreme Court case Berghuis v. Thompkins (560 U.S. 370, 2010), the Court examined a situation where a person being questioned by police knows their right to remain silent under the Miranda v. Arizona case, but doesn't explicitly say they want to remain silent or give up that right.In the landmark case of Hoffman v. Jones (Fla. 1973), the Supreme Court of Florida made a groundbreaking decision that changed the way negligence cases are handled in the state. Attorney Sammy Cacciatore Jr. played a crucial role in convincing the court to adopt the comparative negligence rule, which allows victims to recover damages even if they were partially responsible for the incident. In this wrongful death case, William Harrison Jones Jr. was killed by a truck driven by Philip Francis Hoffman Jr. The court's decision marked a significant departure from the long-standing doctrine of contributory negligence, which barred victims from recovery if they had any degree of fault. Instead, the court adopted the pure comparative negligence rule, allowing victims to receive compensation based on the percentage of fault assigned to the at-fault party. This landmark decision has been cited in law school textbooks and has become the prevailing doctrine in negligence cases in Florida. Van Staphorst v. Maryland (2 U.S. 401, 1791) was the first case ever filed with the United States Supreme Court. Although the court agreed to hear and decide the case, the parties settled before oral arguments took place. Collet v. Collet was the first case to be docketed as an appeal with the Supreme Court. And, West v. Barnes was the first case to be decided by the Court."}], "output": "  The answer to your question is Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan.

In addition to his artistic pursuits, Frazee is also recognized for his humorous science story called The Buttered Cat Paradox, which he wrote for the popular science magazine OMNI. The buttered cat paradox is a funny joke that combines two common sayings in a clever way. It goes like this: The buttered cat paradox: if you rub a cat the wrong way, it will attack you. But if you rub it the right way, it will purr and love you. So, why did the cat get buttered in the first place? This joke plays on the idea that things can go either way, depending on how you approach them, much like the old sayings rub a cat the wrong way and rub a cat the right way. It's a lighthearted and humorous way to highlight the idea that things are not always as simple as they seem.  Yasuda Dai Circus is a Japanese comedy trio, consisting of Danchō (団長 or sometimes Danchō Yasuda), HIRO, and Kuro-chan (クロちゃん). They are different from traditional Japanese comedy groups that rely on skits or story-based humor, instead choosing to focus on physical comedy and a loud, boisterous style that appeals to most manzai audiences. The group was formed in 2001 and got its name from owarai kombi Masuda Okada's Kisuke Masuda in a parody of the famous Kinoshita Dai Circus, with the name Yasuda Dai Circus meaning Great Yasuda Circus. Two Against Tyre is a story set in a fictional world created by Robert E. Howard, featuring one of his lesser-known characters, Eithriall the Gaul.

The story was later adapted by Marvel Comics into an episode of the Conan the Barbarian comics series, but with significant changes to the plot."}], "output": "  New York City**"},

The flight was operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation and the Boeing 707-436 aircraft was piloted by Captain Bernard Dobson, a seasoned pilot with over 6 years of experience flying the same type of plane. Captain Dobson, 45, was from Dorset and had been flying Boeing 707s since November 1960. The Boeing 707 is a medium-sized jet airliner that Boeing built from 1958 to 1979. It's called the 707 for short.

Silver Shadow is a luxury cruise ship that began sailing in 2000, operated by Silversea Cruises. It can accommodate 382 passengers, and there are 295 crew members on board. These numbers are similar to those of Silver Shadow's sister ship, Silver Whisper, which was also built by the Mariotti Shipyard in Genoa, Italy. Both ships have an impressive space-to-passenger ratio of 74, meaning they provide more space per passenger than any other cruise ship. To calculate this ratio, we divide the ship's gross tonnage by its passenger capacity. Additionally, the passenger-to-crew ratio for Silver Shadow is high, at 1.31 to 1."}], "output": "  The largest passenger capacity of the plane type used for BOAC Flight 911 was between 140 and 219 passengers.**"},

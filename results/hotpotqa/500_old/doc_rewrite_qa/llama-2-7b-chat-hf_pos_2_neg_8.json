This song is a source of pride for the university and its students, alumni, and fans. The University of Kansas, also known as KU or Kansas, is a public research university located in the state of Kansas, USA. The main campus is situated in Lawrence, one of the largest college towns in Kansas, and is perched on top of Mount Oread, the highest point in the area. In addition to the main campus, KU has two branch campuses in the Kansas City metropolitan area: the Edwards Campus in Overland Park and the university's medical school and hospital in Kansas City. The university also has educational and research sites in several other towns and cities across Kansas, including Parsons, Topeka, Garden City, Hays, and Leavenworth. Furthermore, KU has branches of its medical school in Wichita and Salina. Interestingly, KU is one of only 62 universities in the prestigious Association of American Universities, a select group of top research institutions in the United States.North Kansas City is a city located in Clay County, Missouri, United States. Although it shares a similar name with its larger counterpart in Kansas City, Missouri, North Kansas City is an independent municipality that is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. According to the 2010 census, the population of North Kansas City was 4,208. Initially, North Kansas City was a northern suburb of Kansas City, Missouri, but it is now almost completely surrounded by Kansas City, which has expanded to the north of North Kansas City's city limits.

It's part of the University of Missouri system, which includes four campuses. UMKC has several locations throughout the city, with the main campus in the Rockhill neighborhood, east of the Country Club Plaza. This campus is near other important institutions like the Stowers Institute for Medical Research and the Linda Hall Library. In 2017, UMKC teamed up with other healthcare organizations to create the UMKC Health Sciences District on Hospital Hill. This partnership brings together local and state governments, the university, and nationally recognized healthcare facilities to work together on research, innovation, education, and community outreach. The goal is to improve health and wellness in the Kansas City area. In the same year, UMKC also announced plans to build a new campus for the arts in downtown Kansas City, near the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. As of 2015, the university had over 16,600 students enrolled. Kansas City jazz is a unique style of jazz that originated in Kansas City, Kansas and Missouri during the 1930s. It signaled a shift from the structured big band style of earlier jazz to a more improvisational style known as bebop. Two key figures in this transition were Count Basie, who joined the Bennie Moten Kansas City Orchestra in 1929, and Charlie Parker, who helped usher in the bebop style in the 1940s. According to a Kansas City website, while New Orleans is often credited as the birthplace of jazz, Kansas City is known as one of the most important cradles of jazz, along with other cities such as Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and New York City. Kansas City Scout is one of the largest electronic traffic management systems in the United States. It was created in 2000 as a joint effort between the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) and the Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) to provide a traffic management system for the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, which spans both Missouri and Kansas. The project cost $43 million, with the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributing about 80-90% of the cost. MoDOT and KDOT shared the remaining cost. The system uses electronic boards placed on major highways throughout the metropolitan area to display traffic information, such as accidents or lane closures, and also has cameras on those boards to automatically detect traffic problems. While the system has coverage of many highways in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, there are still more highways that need to be covered. To prioritize, studies were conducted to identify highways with higher accident rates. Since its launch, the system has expanded significantly and will continue to expand in the future, with plans to cover additional highways, such as I-635 and I-435, especially in the northern areas of the metro, as well as other major city highways. The system was named after the iconic Kansas City Scout Statue in Penn Valley Park, overlooking Downtown Kansas City. Downtown Kansas City is the main business district of Kansas City, Missouri and the surrounding metropolitan area. It's located between the Missouri River to the north and 31st Street to the south, and from the Kansas-Missouri state line to the east to Bruce R. Watkins Drive. The Downtown Council of Kansas City defines the area as being between these boundaries, but the most commonly accepted definition comes from the 2010 Greater Downtown Area Plan created by the City of Kansas City, which includes the city limits of North Kansas City and Missouri to the north, the Kansas-Missouri state line to the west, 31st Street to the south, and Woodland Avenue to the east. The Kansas City metropolitan area is a 15-county area that includes Kansas City, Missouri, and surrounding cities and suburbs in both Kansas and Missouri.

Founded in 1881 by the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word, the university's main campus spans 154 acres of land. The history of the Kansas City metropolitan area begins in the 19th century when French settlers from St. Louis, Missouri migrated up the Missouri River to hunt for fur and trade with Native American tribes. The area, located at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, was an important hub for commerce and security. Kansas City, Missouri was founded in 1838 and eventually became the dominant city west of St. Louis after defeating its rival, Westport. The region played a significant role in the westward expansion of the United States, with the Santa Fe and Oregon trails passing through the area. In 1854, when Kansas was opened to Euro-American settlement, the border between Missouri and Kansas became the site of the first battle of the American Civil War."}], "output": "  The fight song of the university whose main campus is in Lawrence, Kansas and whose branch campuses are in the Kansas City metropolitan area is \"Kansas Song (We're From Kansas).\""},

That season, they made history by becoming the first English team to win the Double (league title and FA Cup) twice. What's even more impressive is that their coach, Alex Ferguson, sold some of his experienced players before the season started, like Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Andrei Kanchelskis. Instead of bringing in new, experienced players, he chose to focus on developing the young players he already had, like Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Paul Scholes, and the Neville brothers, Gary and Phil. Sir Alex Ferguson, born on December 31, 1941, is a former Scottish football manager and player who managed Manchester United from 1986 to 2013. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most successful football managers of all time, with many players, coaches, and analysts agreeing with this assessment.Joshua Parlby was born in 1855 in Longton, Staffordshire, England. He was a football manager who managed Manchester City in the 1890s. In 1996, the 74th FA Charity Shield match was played at Wembley Stadium on August 11. The game was between the winners of the previous season's Premier League and FA Cup competitions, which were Manchester United and Newcastle United, respectively. Manchester United, who had won the Double in 1995-96, emerged victorious with a 4-0 win thanks to goals from Eric Cantona, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, and Roy Keane. The Sir Matt Busby Sports Complex is a public recreation center located in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. It's named after Sir Matt Busby, a famous football manager who was born in Bellshill in 1909. Busby managed Manchester United from 1945 to 1969 and passed away in 1994. Therefore, the sports complex is named in his honor. James Ernest Mangnall was an English football manager who began his career with the club Burnley. He went on to manage Manchester United from 1903 to 1912, then managed Manchester City from 1912 to 1924. Interestingly, Mangnall is the only person to have managed both clubs to date. David Beckham founded the David Beckham Academy in 2005, which was a football school that operated in two locations: London, UK, and Los Angeles, USA. Unfortunately, the academy closed its London location in October 2009 when the lease ended, and the Los Angeles branch closed shortly after. The documentary film Class of '92 was released in 2013 and focuses on the early careers of six young football players who played for Manchester United in the 1990s. The film follows the players' journey from their time at Manchester United starting in 1992 and details their rise to success in the football world. The players featured in the film are David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, and Paul Scholes. David Beckham's Soccer USA was a soccer show hosted by Tim Lovejoy in the UK on Five. The show began after David Beckham moved to the Los Angeles Galaxy and Beckham sometimes appeared on the show in interviews. Each week, a famous British sports personality would visit the studio to talk to Lovejoy about their career and opinions on Major League Soccer. There was also a version of the show hosted by Natalie Pinkham in the USA on Fox Soccer Channel, but it didn't include any footage from the UK studio. Sir Alexander Matthew Busby was a highly respected Scottish football player and manager. He managed Manchester United from 1945 to 1969 and again for the second half of the 1970-71 season. Many people consider him to be one of the greatest football managers of all time. In terms of longevity and managerial records, Busby's achievements at Manchester United are only surpassed by Sir Alex Ferguson."}], "output": "  The football manager who recruited David Beckham managed Manchester United during the timeframe of 1986-2013.**"},

The lake covers an area of 62 acres (0.25 square kilometers) and can be as deep as 13 feet (4 meters). This area used to be called Brown County State Park, and it is situated 8 miles (13 kilometers) east of Hiawatha, Kansas. Brown County (abbreviated BR) is located in the northeast part of Kansas. According to the 2010 census, the county has a population of 9,984 people. The city of Hiawatha is the largest and serves as the county seat. Brown County is home to three Indian reservations: the Kickapoo Indian Reservation of Kansas, the Sac and Fox Reservation, and the Iowa Reservation of Kansas and Nebraska.Fishing Lake is a lake located in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan, between highways 5 and 16. It's about 22 kilometers north of the town of Foam Lake and 24 kilometers east of the town of Wadena. Unfortunately, the lake doesn't have a proper outlet channel, which means it can fill up with water and cause flooding. In 2007, there were record floods that led the government of Saskatchewan to plan a drainage channel to lower the lake's water level. However, the Fishing Lake First Nation didn't agree with this plan, so they built flood control berms instead. Osage State Fishing Lake is located in northern Osage County, Kansas, about a mile east of US 75. It's near the towns of Scranton to the northwest and Overbrook to the northeast. This freshwater lake was created in 1955 and covers an area of 140 acres. The park surrounding the lake has a total of 366 acres of land, most of which is tall grass prairie with many wooded areas. The lake itself is owned by the State of Kansas. Neosho State Fishing Lake, also known as Lake McKinley, is located in Kansas, about 5 miles north of the city of Parsons on Highway 59 and 4 miles east on 40th Road. The lake was built in 1927 and covers 92 acres of water. There are 124 acres of public land surrounding the lake where you can enjoy activities like fishing, camping, and picnicking. The park has a shelter house, fishing piers, picnic tables, barbecue grills, vault toilets, and a water hydrant. Kids aged 15 and under can fish in the catch-and-release youth pond below the dam with an adult accompaniment. The lake is managed by the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Parks. Narrow Hills Provincial Park is a park located in Saskatchewan, Canada. Within its boundaries, the park offers a range of recreational facilities and lakes for visitors to enjoy. These include popular lakes such as Gem Lakes, Lower Fishing Lake, and Upper Fishing Lake, as well as other smaller bodies of water. Shawnee State Fishing Lake is located approximately 8 miles northwest of Topeka, Kansas, in northern Shawnee County. Some people confuse this lake with Lake Shawnee, which is on the east side of Topeka. Shawnee State Fishing Lake is a 135-acre lake with a maximum depth of 25 feet, making it a popular spot for fishing and other water activities. The lake was created in the late 1960s and is a manmade freshwater lake. The widest part of the lake is at the dam, which is located at the south end of the lake. There are several roads that lead to the lake, including an asphalted road on the southeast corner. The addresses of the lake are 94th Street to the north and Humphrey Road on the west side. Higgins Lake is a small community located along the southern and western shores of a recreational and fishing lake in Roscommon County, Michigan. The community is named after the post office that serves the area, which has a ZIP code of 48627. This ZIP code includes several other small communities and locales nearby, such as Hillcrest, Lyon Manor, Detroit Park, Cook Corner, Sharps Corner, Almeda Beach, Oak Grove, Ritz Corner, Pine Bluffs, and Cottage Grove. These communities are often considered part of the Higgins Lake community because they share the same postal address. The lake is situated on the border between Lyon Township to the west and Gerrish Township to the east. US 127 runs along the western shore of the lake, while I-75 and M-18 are located a few miles to the east. Houghton Lake is situated just a few miles south of Higgins Lake. Higgins Lake is a large and popular recreational and fishing spot located in Roscommon County, Michigan. It's a whopping 9,900 acres (40 square kilometers) in size, making it the 10th largest lake in Michigan. The lake is known for its crystal-clear waters and deep depths, with a maximum depth of 135 feet and a mean depth of 44 feet. That's a lot of water! In fact, Higgins Lake contains a staggering 20 billion cubic feet (570 million cubic meters) of water. The lake's water is refreshed every 12.5 years or so, thanks to the twin-lobed shape of the lake and the way it's fed by submerged springs, incoming streams, and direct rainfall and runoff. After a while, the water flows into Marl Lake through the Cut River, which eventually leads to Houghton Lake and then to Lake Michigan. But don't worry, most of the water from Higgins Lake doesn't end up in the Atlantic Ocean – a mile north of the lake, it flows into the Lake Huron watershed instead. Lake Commanda, located in central Ontario, Canada, is a beautiful lake nestled between Patterson and Pringle Townships in the Almaguin Highlands region of Parry Sound. It's fed by three creeks - Gee Creek, Commanda Creek, and Beaudry Creek - and drains into the Restoule River. The lake is shaped like a 3, with a long, narrow spur in the middle called Deep Bay. There's only one permanent island on the lake, located off a point on the east shore. The water is murky, or tea-coloured, and the lake is home to Northern pike, Walleye, Smallmouth bass, and Largemouth bass fish species. The northern shore of the lake has a community called Restoule, and many cottages line the shore. There's also plenty of crown land surrounding the lake, making it a peaceful spot for people of all ages to enjoy. The lake has one public boat launch located near the southern end, accessible from Commanda Lake Road. At an elevation of 729 feet above sea level, Lake Commanda is a great all-year-round fishing destination, thanks to its thick ice cover in the winter."}], "output": "  The passage does not provide the population of Brown State Fishing Lake, as it is mentioned in Kansas, United States, but the population of the surrounding county is not provided.

He is famous for composing operas, which are musical dramas that are performed on stage with singers, actors, and orchestras. Verdi was born in Italy and spent most of his life there, creating many of his most famous works, such as La Traviata and Aida, which are still popular today. Charles Louis Ambroise Thomas was a famous French composer who lived from August 5, 1811 to February 12, 1896. He is best known for writing operas like Mignon (1866) and Hamlet (1868, based on a play by William Shakespeare). Additionally, Thomas served as the Director of the Conservatoire de Paris from 1871 until his death.Bernhard Bötel was a well-known German operatic tenor and actor who had a successful career in Germany and Austria during the first half of the 20th century. He made recordings for several record labels during the early days of the recording industry, including His Master's Voice, Odeon Records, Polydor Records, Tri-Ergon, and Vox Records. On stage, he sang a wide range of roles in operas and operettas, including leading parts and supporting roles. Some of his most notable roles included Belmonte in Mozart's The Abduction from the Seraglio, Chapelou in Adam's The Postillion of Lonjumeau, Count Almaviva in Rossini's The Barber of Seville, Daniel in Lehár's The Merry Widow, the Duke of Mantua in Verdi's Rigoletto, Gabriel von Eisenstein in Strauss' Die Fledermaus, Indigo in Strauss' Indigo and the Forty Robbers, Jeník in Smetana's The Bartered Bride, Paolino in Cimarosa's The Secret Marriage, Pâris in Offenbach's La belle Hélène, Pietro in Suppé's Boccaccio, and Wilhelm Meister in Thomas' Mignon. Giuseppe Verdi is a 1938 Italian biographical film directed by Carmine Gallone and starring Fosco Giachetti, Gaby Morlay, and Germana Paolieri. The film tells the story of the famous Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi (1813-1901) and how he lived his life. The casting of Fosco Giachetti as Verdi was deliberate, as he had recently played patriotic roles in other films like The White Squadron, which highlighted Verdi's patriotism. The movie was filmed at Cinecittà Studios in Rome, and it's also known by the alternative title The Life of Giuseppe Verdi. Parma Airport, also known as Giuseppe Verdi Airport or Parma Giuseppe Verdi Airport, is located 1.3 nautical miles (2.1 kilometers) northwest of Parma, a city in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy.

Ferdinando Angelo Maria Provesi was born in Parma, Italy in 1770 and is considered one of the greatest opera composers of his time. He was the Maestro di cappella (master of music) at the St. Bartolomeo cathedral in Busseto, a town near Verdi's hometown of Le Roncole. Provesi taught Verdi, who was just 11 years old at the time, beginning in 1824. In addition to teaching Verdi, Provesi was also the director of the municipal music school and the local Philharmonic Society. This list highlights some of the most influential opera composers throughout history, based on their appearance on multiple lists of significant opera composers. (You can find the sources of these lists in the Lists Consulted section.) The list starts with Jacopo Peri, who wrote the very first opera in Italy in the late 16th century, and ends with John Adams, one of the most prominent contemporary opera composers. Each composer is accompanied by a brief explanation of why they are considered important. Additionally, we've included a section on major women opera composers, also based on the same lists.

The remote was originally designed to control the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5, and it's compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers. The Apple Remote was the primary control mechanism for the first three generations of Apple TV. However, it has since been replaced by the Siri Remote in the fourth generation. Before the Apple Remote, Apple made several anonymous IR remotes for products like the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive. Front Row was a software application for Mac computers and Apple TV that allowed users to navigate and play videos, photos, podcasts, and music through a user-friendly interface. It was similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi and worked by using iTunes and iPhoto. The software could be controlled using an Apple Remote or keyboard function keys. Front Row was first released in October 2005 and had two major updates since. However, Apple removed and discontinued Front Row in Mac OS X 10.7.A universal remote is a remote control that can work with different brands and types of consumer electronics devices. Some universal remotes can only control a limited number of devices, while others allow you to add new device codes to the remote. Many remotes that come with electronic devices, like TVs or DVD players, also have universal remote capabilities, which means you can use them to control other devices too. For example, you can program a VCR remote to work with different brands of TVs. In simple terms, a remote control is a device that allows you to control another electronic device from a distance. For example, you might use a remote control to turn on your TV, DVD player, or other home appliances without having to get up from your couch. Remote controls are super convenient because they allow you to operate devices that are out of reach, like a garage door opener or a projector that's mounted high on a ceiling. So, you can easily control your devices without having to physically touch them. Apple Inc. released the Siri Remote in 2015, along with the 4th Generation Apple TV, at an Apple Keynote Address led by CEO Tim Cook on October 26th. The Remote is designed specifically for use with the always-on Siri-capable Apple TV, and is a successor to the original Apple Remote. It's also compatible with the Apple TV 4K. NetSupport Manager is a software program that allows you to control and manage computers and mobile devices from a Windows or Windows Mobile device. It was first created in 1989 and has been updated over the years to include support for more platforms, including Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, and mobile devices. With NetSupport Manager, you can remotely control and manage multiple computers and devices at the same time, just like you would with a KVM switch. You can also transfer files, chat with remote users, and get information about the hardware and software on remote systems. While NetSupport Manager offers many features, some of them are not available for Linux and Mac clients. In 2012, NetSupport introduced new software versions that allowed remote control from iOS and Android tablets and smartphones, as well as a new Mac OS Control. The latest version of NetSupport Manager, released in 2013, extended platform support to include ChromeOS clients. Additionally, mobile remote control from iOS and Android devices was also updated with new capabilities. To use NetSupport Manager, you need to install the software on both the local (control) and remote (client) computers or devices beforehand. Apple Watch (stylized as WATCH) is a line of smartwatches made by Apple Inc. These watches have fitness and health features that work with other Apple devices. There are different versions of the watch, such as Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Hermès, and Apple Watch Edition. The watch can do some things on its own, but it also needs to be connected to an iPhone to do other things like make calls and send texts. The watch is compatible with iPhones from 2014 onwards, and it uses Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to connect to the phone. Apple started selling the watch in 2015 and it quickly became the most popular wearable device. Apple has released two newer versions of the watch since then: Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Series 3. The Series 3 watch was released in 2017. MacScan is an anti-malware tool for Mac computers that helps remove harmful software like spyware, Trojans, keyloggers, and tracking cookies. It was one of the first anti-spyware programs available for Mac OS X when it was first released. In addition to removing malware, MacScan also checks for remote administration programs like Apple Remote Desktop to make sure they're installed with the user's permission. Lionel's Trainmaster Command (TMCC) system is an electronic control system used for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains from 1994 to 2006. It works similarly to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry standard for HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains, but TMCC has an advantage in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run with non-TMCC locomotives and other systems, such as Lionel Legacy engines, LionChief, and LionChief Plus. These other systems require a separate remote controller. MTH Corporation's DCS controller can also be used to control TMCC locomotives. All four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief/LionChief+, and DCS) can be used on the same track, as they all require a constant track voltage (18 volts). TMCC/Legacy broadcasts signals to the antenna on the locomotives, which listen for signals that identify the locomotive and then receive commands for speed, direction, sounds, lighting, and other features. DCS works differently, transmitting a carrier over the rails that is picked up by the locomotive's electrical pickup contacts. LionChief/LionChief+ remote controls also work differently, as the remote and locomotive are married and require a separate remote control for each locomotive. This system is easy to use and doesn't require any additional wiring, as the control is transmitted directly to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener works. In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that can learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, making it simpler to operate multiple trains. Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) is a Mac application created by Apple Inc. that was first released on March 14, 2002. It replaced a similar product called Apple Network Assistant. ARD is designed for computer administrators who manage a lot of computers and teachers who need to help individuals or demonstrate things to groups. With ARD, users can remotely control or monitor other computers over a network. This makes it easy to manage and support multiple computers without having to be physically present at each one."}], "output": "  The other device that the Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with is the Macintosh TV."},

Abdul Wali was an Afghan man who died in US custody on June 21, 2003, at the age of 28. He had been held for three days at a US base in Afghanistan, suspected of involvement in a rocket attack on the base. Initially, his death was reported to be a heart attack, but three US soldiers later came forward and claimed that a CIA contractor, David Passaro, had beaten him severely. Passaro, a former US Army Ranger, allegedly beat Wali for two consecutive nights, causing serious injuries including a fractured pelvis. Prosecutors claimed that Passaro and other soldiers prevented Wali from sleeping, limiting his access to food and water, and subjected him to two nights of interrogation and beatings. Witnesses testified that Passaro kicked Wali in the groin, threw him to the ground, and beat him with a flashlight. After the second night of beatings, Wali begged the soldiers to kill him and cried out in pain. He died on his fourth day in custody, despite denying any involvement in the rocket attacks. James A.

The company was founded by Henry J. Kaiser in the 1940s to supply steel plates to the shipbuilding industry on the Pacific coast, which expanded during World War II, then contracted, and then grew again during the Korean War. One of the shipyards Kaiser operated was California Shipbuilding Corporation on Terminal Island, California, which built hundreds of Liberty ships and Victory ships during World War II. Kaiser Steel was known for making the most of its expensive steel production inputs and eventually captured a significant share of the Pacific Coast steel market by the 1950s. The company's assets included steel mills in Napa, California (acquired from Basalt Rock Company in 1955) and Fontana, California (now operated by California Steel Industries), as well as a former open-pit iron ore mine at Eagle Mountain, California. The steel produced by Kaiser Ventures was also used in Kaiser Motors. Henry John Kaiser was an American businessman who became famous for revolutionizing the shipbuilding industry in the United States. Born in 1882 and passing away in 1967, Kaiser founded Kaiser Shipyards during World War II, which produced Liberty ships that played a crucial role in the war effort. After this success, he went on to establish Kaiser Aluminum and Kaiser Steel, two companies that further solidified his legacy.\n\nKaiser was also a pioneer in the field of healthcare, as he established Kaiser Permanente, a healthcare program that provided medical care to his workers and their families. In addition to his work in the shipbuilding and steel industries, Kaiser also ventured into the automobile business, leading Kaiser-Frazer and Kaiser Motors, both of which were known for their safety features.\n\nKaiser's wealth and success allowed him to pursue other interests, including large construction projects such as civic centers and dams, as well as real estate investments. To give back to the community, he established the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports various charitable causes. Throughout his life, Kaiser's innovative spirit and entrepreneurial mindset made him a respected figure in American business and industry.  Edgar Fosburgh Kaiser Jr. was an American-Canadian businessman and former owner of the Denver Broncos football team. He was born in Portland, Oregon on July 5, 1942, and is the grandson of Henry J. Kaiser, a prominent shipbuilding industrialist. Kaiser earned degrees from Stanford University and Harvard University, including a BA and an MBA. He served in various roles in the U.S. government, including as a White House Fellow and Special Assistant to Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Walter J. Hickel. Kaiser became a Canadian citizen in 1980 and passed away on January 11, 2012.

Neafie, Levy & Co., also known as Neafie & Levy, was a Philadelphia-based shipbuilding and engineering company that operated from the mid-19th to early 20th centuries. They were pioneers in the field of marine engineering, becoming America's first specialized marine engineers. In fact, they were the first company in the United States to combine shipbuilding with the manufacture of steam engines to power them. Additionally, they were the largest supplier of screw propellers to other North American shipbuilding firms in their early years and at the height of their success in the early 1870s, they were Philadelphia's most active and well-capitalized shipbuilder. During World War II, there were seven major shipbuilding yards on the West Coast of the United States called the Kaiser Shipyards. These yards were owned by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, which was founded by Henry J. Kaiser in 1939. Kaiser was a successful industrialist who wanted to help the United States meet its goal of constructing merchant ships as quickly as possible. By doing so, he ranked 20th among all U.S. corporations in terms of the value of wartime production contracts. John Roach & Sons was a significant American company founded in 1864 by Irish immigrant John Roach. During the 1870s, the company became the largest shipbuilder in the United States, producing more iron ships than its two main competitors combined. In fact, it was the largest contractor to the U.S. Navy during this time period and, at its peak, was the second-largest employer in the country after the railroads. The New York Shipbuilding Corporation, also known as New York Ship, was an American company that built ships from 1899 to 1968. During its time, the company completed over 500 vessels for the US Navy, the United States Merchant Marine, the United States Coast Guard, and other maritime organizations. At its peak during World War II, New York Ship was the world's largest and most productive shipyard, building ships such as destroyers, cruisers, aircraft carriers, and nuclear-powered cargo ships like the NS Savannah. The company is also known for building a quartet of cargo-passenger liners called the Four Aces. Edgar Fosburgh Kaiser Sr. was an important American businessman who led three major companies: Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corporation, Kaiser Cement Corporation, and Kaiser Steel Corporation.

Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes (MSPE) is a tabletop role-playing game created by Michael A. Stackpole and first published in 1983 by Blade, a division of Flying Buffalo, Inc. The game has undergone revisions and has been reprinted by Sleuth Publications. MSPE is similar to the game Tunnels and Trolls, but it also includes a skill system for characters. Some adventure modules were released for the game, and the ruleset of the 1987 video game Wasteland, which Michael A. Stackpole worked on, is based on MSPE. Interestingly, the upcoming 2013 video game sequel Wasteland 2 will also use similar mechanics, making it another game based on MSPE.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Crank Caverns are the remains of a former sandstone quarry located near Crank in St. Helens, Merseyside. The quarry was in operation as early as 1730 and grew in size over the years, but as the demand for land to expand the quarry increased, the owners decided to change their mining method. Instead of removing the sandstone from the surface, they began mining it underground, following a seam of stone until it was depleted. This resulted in the network of caves, tunnels, and shafts that exist today. By 1854, the site was listed as a colliery and was owned by Charles Howarth, also known as Yorkshire Charlie. The mining operation ceased in the 1930s, and the area was used as a game reserve by the Earl of Derby until the Second World War. After the war, the caverns were no longer used as a game reserve and have since been the subject of local legends and myths. Today, while the caverns are not officially open to the public, they are still accessible through a nearby footpath and remain a popular spot for curious locals to explore.

They have sold over 40 million records worldwide and 15 million records in the United States alone. The band has had several hit singles on the Billboard Hot 100, including six Top 10 singles and one number-one hit, Every Rose Has Its Thorn. Their breakthrough debut album, Look What the Cat Dragged In, was released in 1986 and was a major success. They continued their success with their second album, Open Up and Say... Ahh!, which was their most successful album, selling 5x platinum in the US. The band's popularity carried over into the new decade with their third consecutive multi-platinum album, Flesh & Blood. Shut Up, Make Love is a song by the American rock band Poison, released in 2000. It was the first single played on the radio from their album Crack a Smile...and More!, which came out the same year. The song also appears on a second promotional single called Be the One as a B-side. This was Poison's fifth studio album, called Crack a Smile, which was released on March 14, 2000 and peaked at #131 on the Billboard 200 chart. This song was special because it was the first time Poison performed with their new lead guitarist, Blues Saraceno.All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You is a song by the rock band Heart, which was composed by the experienced songwriter and producer Robert John Mutt Lange. The song was released as the lead single from the band's tenth studio album, Brigade, and their first hit single of the 1990s. Interestingly, the song was first recorded in 1979 by Dobie Gray, but with different lyrics. Be the One is a powerful rock ballad by the American band Poison, which was released as the second single from their album Crack a Smile...and More! in February 2000. The single included five b-sides, including the album's first single Shut Up, Make Love, as well as four unplugged bonus tracks from the album: Every Rose Has Its Thorn, Talk Dirty to Me, Your Mama Don't Dance, and Something to Believe In. Make Love is a song by American singer and songwriter Keri Hilson from her debut studio album, In a Perfect World..., released in 2009. The song was written by Jamal Polow da Don Jones, Ester Dean, and Jason Perry, and produced by Polow da Don and Perry. Make Love is an R&B ballad with a slow tempo. Some music critics gave mixed reviews to the song, saying it was too long and that Hilson's vocals were not impressive. However, some critics also praised the song as one of the album's standout tracks. The album Make Love Not War by Australian rock band Cosmic Nomads was released in 2004. It was recorded in Sydney, New South Wales at Damien Gerard Studios with renowned engineer Russell Pilling, who has over 25 years of experience in the music industry. Pilling has worked with well-known bands such as The Vines, The Church, The Cruel Sea, and Jon Stevens. To promote the album, a single and music video with the same name were released and distributed by MGM Sydney before the album's release. Pilling says that Make Love Not War is an album that grows on you after repeated listens, and its meaning becomes clearer. Dan Fogelberg's Greatest Hits album featured two previously unreleased songs, Missing You and Make Love Stay. These songs were released as singles and reached impressive chart positions. Missing You peaked at #23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while Make Love Stay reached #29. Even more notably, both songs did well on the adult contemporary chart, with Missing You reaching #6 and Make Love Stay becoming Fogelberg's third #1 on the AC chart. Chuck Berry on Stage is an album by Chuck Berry, released in 1963 by Chess Records. Although it was promoted as a live album, it actually contains previously released studio recordings (except for five songs) with added audience sounds to make it sound like a live recording. The album features a track called Surfin' USA, which is actually a re-recording of Berry's 1958 song Sweet Little Sixteen. Interestingly, the melody of this song was later used by The Beach Boys in their hit Surfin' USA in 1963. Additionally, Berry's cover of Willie Dixon's I Just Want to Make Love to You was re-recorded and released on a rare album in 1975. The Longer We Make Love is a song by American singer Barry White from his 1999 album Staying Power. The song was written by White, Aaron Schroeder, and Marlon Saunders, and produced by White and Jack Perry.

Music critics praised the song, and it was released as a CD single in some European countries on July 19, 1999. Additionally, it was issued as a promotional single in the United States. Unfortunately, the song did not chart. The album Mind If We Make Love to You is by the American power pop group Wondermints, released in 2002 on the label Smile Records.

Buck-Tick is a Japanese rock band that was formed in Fujioka, Gunma in 1983. The band has had the same lineup of Atsushi Sakurai (lead vocals), Hisashi Imai (guitar), Hidehiko Hoshino (guitar), Yutaka Higuchi (bass), and Toll Yagami (drums) since 1985. Over the past three decades, Buck-Tick has released 20 studio albums, with nearly all of them reaching the top ten on the charts. In fact, three of their albums from the late eighties and early nineties reached the top of the charts. The band is widely recognized as one of the pioneers of the visual kei movement, a popular Japanese music style characterized by flamboyant and androgynous fashion and makeup.Atsushi Sakurai is a Japanese musician and singer-songwriter born on March 7, 1966, in Fujioka, Gunma. He has been the lead vocalist of the rock band Buck-Tick since 1985, where he previously played drums from 1983. In addition to his work with Buck-Tick, Sakurai has also released a solo album titled Ai no Wakusei in 2004 and was a member of the band Schwein alongside other notable musicians such as Hisashi Imai (Buck-Tick), Sascha Konietzko (KMFDM), and Raymond Watts. More recently, Sakurai formed a solo project called The Mortal in 2015. The Alberta Hail Project was a research initiative funded by the Alberta Research Council and Environment Canada to investigate the physics and dynamics of hailstorms. The project ran from 1956 to 1985, and its main tool was a circularly polarized S-band weather radar located at the Red Deer Industrial Airport in central Alberta, Canada. The radar was used to study hailstorms in detail in order to develop and test methods for reducing hail. Hayden, a Canadian singer-songwriter, released a 7-inch vinyl single called Mild and Hazy in 1996. This single was released on Hayden's own label, Hardwood Records, as well as on Lunamoth. The cover of the single features a photo of Hayden as a toddler. The song Gouge Away is actually a cover of the Pixies' song from their album Doolittle. Masami Tsuchiya is a Japanese singer-songwriter and musician who rose to fame in the late 1970s as the lead vocalist and guitarist of the band Ippu-Do. Since then, he has released solo music and has collaborated with a variety of artists from different genres. Tsuchiya has worked with musicians such as the English new wave rock band Japan, Bill Nelson, Ryuichi Sakamoto (a Japanese electronica composer), Duran Duran's side project Arcadia, and the Japanese rock band Buck-Tick. Hailstorm Alley is a term used to describe an area in southern and central Alberta, Canada, where hail storms occur frequently. These storms can cause significant damage to property. The area includes communities such as High River, Calgary, Red Deer, and Lacombe, and stretches west to Rocky Mountain House. This region is known for experiencing some of the most severe hail storms in the world. While Hailstorm Alley is particularly prone to damaging hail, hailstorms can occur throughout central and southern Alberta during the summer months. In fact, the city of Calgary is often referred to as the hailstorm capital of Canada. Dewey Beard, also known as Wasú Máza or Iron Hail, was a Minneconjou Lakota warrior who fought in the Battle of Little Bighorn as a teenager. After the defeat of George Armstrong Custer, Wasu Maza went into exile in Canada and then returned to South Dakota, where he lived on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation. Unfortunately, many historians have confused Wasu Maza with another Lakota leader named Chief Iron Tail, leading to incorrect accounts of his involvement in the Battle of Little Bighorn and the fate of his family. In reality, it was Wasu Maza who suffered losses, including the death of his family in 1890 at Wounded Knee, not Chief Iron Tail. Kyo is a talented Japanese musician, poet, and singer-songwriter. He is most well-known for being the lead vocalist of the popular metal band Dir en grey, which he joined in 1997. Prior to this, he was a member of the band La:Sadie's. Kyo's passion for music was sparked when he saw a photo of the vocalist of the band Buck-Tick, Atsushi Sakurai, on the desk of a classmate in junior high school. Kyo's singing voice is in the tenor range. Hayden's third album, Skyscraper National Park, was released on three different labels in different countries. In Canada, it came out on Hardwood Records. In the US, it was released on Badman Recording Co. In the UK, it was released on Loose Music. And in Japan, it was released on Massive!.

During World War I, Nungesser was a highly skilled pilot and achieved 43 air combat victories, making him the third-highest ranking ace in France. Nungesser was born on March 15, 1892, and it's believed that he died on or after May 8, 1927. L'Oiseau Blanc, also known as The White Bird, was a French biplane aircraft that disappeared in 1927 during an attempt to make the first non-stop transatlantic flight between Paris and New York City. The plane was flown by two French aviation heroes, Charles Nungesser and François Coli, who took off from Paris on May 8, 1927. Unfortunately, the plane was last seen over Ireland, and despite an extensive search, it was never found. Just two weeks later, another aviator, Charles Lindbergh, successfully completed the same journey and won the Orteig Prize flying the Spirit of St. Louis.François Coli was a French pilot and navigator who gained fame as the one-eyed co-pilot of Charles Nungesser during their ill-fated attempt to fly across the Atlantic Ocean in 1927. Coli and Nungesser, flying their plane L'Oiseau Blanc, disappeared on May 8, 1927, while attempting to become the first people to cross the Atlantic by air. Coli was born on June 5, 1881, and is believed to have died sometime after their disappearance. Georges Félix Madon was a highly skilled French pilot during World War I. He was ranked as the fourth best ace pilot in France, which means he was one of the best pilots in the country. Madon had a very long and impressive career as a pilot, and he had a lot of different experiences in aviation. This made him truly remarkable. William Earl Johns was an English pilot and writer who was born on February 5, 1893, and passed away on June 21, 1968. He was known for writing adventure stories under the pen name Captain W. E. Johns. He is most famous for creating the character of Biggles, a pilot and adventurer who features in many of his stories.   Gervais Raoul Victor Lufbery was a French and American fighter pilot and flying ace in World War I. He served in both the French Air Force and the United States Army Air Service, which is why he is sometimes referred to as either a French ace or an American ace. Of his 17 combat victories, all but one occurred while flying in French units. L'Oiseau bleu (also known as The Blue Bird and Der Blaue Vogel) is a large oil painting created by French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger in 1912-1913. Metzinger, along with Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, is considered one of the founders of Cubism, as recognized by Guillaume Apollinaire and André Salmon. L'Oiseau bleu is one of Metzinger's most well-known and frequently referenced works, which was first exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris in the spring of 1913 (catalog number 2087). The painting was later shown at the 1913 exhibition in Berlin under the title Der blaue Vogel (catalog number 287). Apollinaire described L'Oiseau bleu as a brilliant and important work by Metzinger. Today, the painting is part of the permanent collection at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, which was acquired by the City of Paris in 1937. In the 1920s, French aircraft manufacturer Levasseur modified two of their PL.4 carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft to create the single-engine, two-seat Levasseur PL.8 long-distance record-breaking biplane. The company built the aircraft in 1927 specifically for two pilots, Charles Nungesser and François Coli, who were attempting to win the Orteig Prize, a famous transatlantic flight award. Only two PL.8 aircraft were made, with the first one, L'Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird), gaining fame as Nungesser and Coli's aircraft. Sergeant Paul Joannes Sauvage was a famous French pilot during World War I. He was credited with shooting down eight enemy planes and damaging six others in aerial battles. Sauvage started flying with Escadrille 65, where he scored his first victory on July 16, 1916. At just 19 years old, he became the youngest French flying ace of the war. Tragically, he was killed by anti-aircraft fire on January 7, 1917, while still in the prime of his flying career. In 1927, two American Navy airmen, Lieutenant Stanton Hall Wooster and Lieutenant Commander Noel Guy Davis, attempted to fly across the Atlantic Ocean from New York to Paris in an effort to win a $25,000 prize offered by a hotelier named Raymond Orteig. Other competitors for the prize included a French World War I pilot named Rene Fonck and his crew, as well as USN Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd and his team. On the other side of the Atlantic, the competitors included another French World War I pilot, Charles Nungesser, and his navigator, Francois Coli. Wooster and Davis were competing against some of the best pilots and navigators of their time, but they were determined to be the first to complete the nonstop flight between New York and Paris."}], "output": "  The French ace pilot and adventurer who flew L'Oiseau Blanc was Charles Nungesser."},

The movie focuses on two hackers known as Electron and Phoenix, who were part of an elite group called The Realm. They gained access to some of the most secure computer networks in the world, including those of the US Naval Research Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a government lab responsible for securing the US nuclear arsenal, and NASA.

The film tells the story of a group of high school friends who get involved in a big corporate scandal where they use their hacking skills to extort money. This movie was released during a time when the internet was still new and mysterious to most people, so it reflects the ideas in a famous hacking manifesto that's quoted in the film. The manifesto talks about how hackers don't have things like skin color or nationality, and how they're seen as criminals even though their crime is just being curious. Hackers has become a cult classic. Freakonomics Radio is a popular American public radio program that explores various socioeconomic issues in a way that's easy to understand for a general audience.

They're most famous for their 1994 song Here & Now, which is on their first full-length album called Aurora Gory Alice. The band has six members: Kay Hanley, Greg McKenna, Michael Eisenstein, Stacy Jones, Scott Riebling, and later, Tom Polce. Screaming Trees was a popular American rock band formed in Ellensburg, Washington in 1985. The band was made up of four talented musicians: Mark Lanegan (vocals), Gary Lee Conner (guitar), Van Conner (bass), and Mark Pickerel (drums). However, Pickerel left the band before they reached their peak success and was replaced by Barrett Martin. Despite being often associated with the grunge music genre, Screaming Trees' sound actually incorporated a mix of hard rock and psychedelic elements. During their time together, the band released a total of seven studio albums, five EPs, and three compilations.Truly was an American rock band formed during the grunge era of the 1990s. The band consisted of singer-guitarist Robert Roth, bassist Hiro Yamamoto, and drummer Mark Pickerel. Interestingly, Yamamoto and Pickerel were also founding members of other influential Seattle bands, Soundgarden and Screaming Trees, respectively. Although Truly didn't achieve the same level of commercial success as some of their Seattle peers, they managed to stick together for over a decade and release two studio albums. The Screaming Trees released only one album, called Change Has Come, through the independent label Sub Pop in 1990. After that, they moved on to a major label, Epic Records, and released three more albums - Uncle Anesthesia, Sweet Oblivion, and Dust - as well as an EP called Something About Today. Beat Happening's second album, Jamboree, was released in 1988 through K Records and Rough Trade Records. The album was produced by Steve Fisk, with assistance from Screaming Trees members Mark Lanegan and Gary Lee Conner (who played a brief guitar solo on Midnight a Go-Go). However, Cat Walk was produced by Patrick Maley, and The This Many Boyfriends Club was recorded live by Rich Jensen. The album marks a darker shift in the band's signature tweepop sound, due to a thicker production and a greater emphasis on songs written by Calvin Johnson. Heather Lewis only provided vocals on two songs, In Between and Ask Me. At the time of the album's release, Calvin described the sound of Jamboree as dark and sexy. Despite this, the band still maintained their focus on exuberance over musicianship, as evidenced by the story of guitarist Bret Lunsford accidentally playing through a stuck guitar string during the recording of the album opener, Bewitched. Gary Lee Conner, born on August 22, 1962, in Fort Irwin, California, was the lead guitarist for the rock band Screaming Trees. He began his career with Screaming Trees in 1985 and continued playing with the band until they disbanded in 2000. During his time with Screaming Trees, Conner released two solo albums: The Purple Outside-Mystery Lane in 1990 and Grasshopper's Daydream/Behind The Smile in 1999. He also made appearances on other artists' albums, including Indian Summer and Midnight a Go-Go by Beat Happening and Against the 70s by Mike Watt from Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. After a decade of relative seclusion, Conner released a new album in 2010 from his band Microdot Gnome, titled 4D Sugarcubes. He has since released another solo album, Ether Trippers, in August 2016 on Strange Earth Records. Mad Season was a rock band formed in Seattle, Washington in 1994 by musicians from three popular Seattle bands: Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Screaming Trees. They only released one album, called Above, and are best known for their song River of Deceit. The band went on hiatus in 1996 because of the members' busy schedules and lead singer Layne Staley's struggles with drug abuse. Attempts were made in the late 1990s to revive the group without Staley, but the band eventually disbanded after bassist John Baker Saunders died in 1999. Staley passed away three years later from a drug overdose. Beat Happening and Screaming Trees, two bands from Washington state, collaborated on an EP called Beat Happening/Screaming Trees in 1988. The album was first released on the Homestead Records label and later included in Beat Happening's box set Crashing Through in 2002. Kurt Cobain, lead singer of Nirvana, mentioned Polly Pereguin as his favorite pop song of the 1980s in a letter to Mark Lanegan, which was included in Cobain's personal journal. The discography of Screaming Trees, a rock band from Ellensburg, Washington, includes seven studio albums, three compilation albums, five EPs (extended plays), and six singles. This list only includes the band's official releases and does not include any solo work by the individual members of Screaming Trees. Van Conner was born in Apple Valley, California on March 17, 1967. He is an American musician who played rock music. In 1984, he started a band called Screaming Trees with his brother Gary Lee Conner and their friends Mark Lanegan and Mark Pickerel. They announced their breakup on June 25, 2000. After that, Conner started a new band called Gardener, which released one album in the 1990s under the name New Dawning Time. Conner has also played as a session musician for other well-known bands like Queens of the Stone Age and helped Mark Lanegan on his solo album I'll Take Care of You."}], "output": "  According to the passage, Screaming Trees had more members than Letters to Cleo.

They believed in revolutionary socialism and had two main branches: democratic socialists and agrarian socialists. After the February Revolution in 1917, they shared power with other liberal and socialist groups in the Russian Provisional Government. In the first democratic elections held in Russia, the SRs won the most votes. However, the October Revolution changed the political landscape, and the Bolsheviks disbanded the elected government in January 1918. The SRs then split into two groups: pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik. The anti-Bolshevik group, known as the Right SRs, remained loyal to the leader of the Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, but they were defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Russian Civil War (1917-1922) was a complex and multi-sided conflict in Russia after the Russian Revolutions of 1917. Many different groups, including the Red Army (fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin) and the White Army (comprised of various factions supporting monarchism, capitalism, and alternative forms of socialism), fought to determine Russia's political future. Other groups, such as militant socialists and non-ideological Green armies, also participated in the conflict. Eight foreign nations intervened in the war, including the Allied Forces and pro-German armies. The Red Army ultimately defeated the White Army in key battles in Ukraine and Siberia in 1919, and the remaining White forces were defeated in Crimea and evacuated in 1920. Some minor skirmishes continued until 1923, but the war effectively ended in 1923 when Red control was established in the newly formed Soviet Union. The conflict resulted in an estimated 7-12 million casualties, mostly civilians, and has been described as the greatest national catastrophe Europe had seen.In Russia, communism began after the Tsar, Nicholas II, lost power during the February Revolution. A new government called the Provisional Government was set up under Prince Lvov, but the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, refused to accept it and staged a revolution in October 1917. Lenin and the Bolsheviks took control of Russia and established the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. This marked the start of the Russian Civil War between the Bolsheviks (also known as the Reds) and their opposing groups, the Whites. In 1922, the Reds emerged victorious and formed the Soviet Union. Lenin died in 1924, leading to a power struggle among party leaders. Joseph Stalin eventually seized power and ruled the Soviet Union until 1953, promoting a culture of political paranoia and conducting the Great Purge to eliminate his opponents.   Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov (Russian: Лавр Гео́ргиевич Корни́лов, August 18, 1870 – April 13, 1918) was a skilled military officer, explorer, and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the subsequent Russian Civil War. He is best known for the Kornilov Affair, an unsuccessful attempt in August/September 1917 to strengthen the Provisional Government led by Alexander Kerensky, but which led to Kerensky arresting and charging Kornilov with attempting a coup d'état. This event ultimately weakened Kerensky's rule and strengthened the position of the Soviet government and the Bolshevik party. After the October Revolution in 1917, there were several uprisings and rebellions by left-wing groups against the Bolsheviks. These groups, including some Socialist Revolutionaries, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists, started fighting the Bolsheviks soon after the Revolution and continued throughout the Russian Civil War (1917-1922) and into the early years of Soviet rule (1922-1924). The Bolsheviks initially tried to include these groups in their government, but as the uprisings continued, they began to use force to suppress them. Louise Bryant was a prominent American feminist, political activist, and journalist who is best known for her coverage of the Russian Revolution. She was born on December 5, 1885 and married writer John Reed in 1916. Bryant traveled to Russia multiple times and wrote articles about the country's leaders, including Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. Her news stories were published in newspapers across the United States and Canada after World War I. In 1918, a collection of her articles from her first trip to Russia was published in a book called Six Red Months in Russia. The following year, Bryant testified before a Senate subcommittee, defending the revolution and denouncing armed U.S. intervention in Russia. In 1919, she embarked on a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks.   The Battle of Romanovka took place in June 1919 during the Russian Civil War. Russian Bolsheviks, led by Yakov Triapitsyn, launched a surprise attack on an American army camp near Vladivostok in Siberia. The attack was repelled, and the resulting battle was one of the final major engagements of the Russian Civil War involving the United States. Although there were smaller skirmishes between the Americans and Bolsheviks/Cossacks in the following months, the Americans emerged victorious in all of them. Alexander Kerensky tried to regain power after the Bolsheviks overthrew his government in Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) in 1917. Kerensky, who was the leader of the Provisional Government, launched the Kerensky-Krasnov uprising as a last-ditch effort to reclaim control of the country from the Bolsheviks. Timofey Petrovich Samsonov (Russian: Тимофей Петрович Самсонов) was a prominent Soviet politician who lived from May 9, 1888, to October 28, 1955. He played a significant role in the Russian Civil War and was elected to several important positions within the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Specifically, he was a member of the Central Committee elected by the 15th, 16th, and 17th Congresses of the party. In addition, he served as the Chief Administrator from 1927 to 1935 and head of the Accounting Department from 1932 to 1934. Samsonov died in Moscow. Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky (also known as Alexandra Fyodorovich Kerensky) was a Russian lawyer and important political figure during the Russian Revolution of 1917. After the February Revolution, he joined the new Russian Provisional Government and held various positions, including Minister of Justice, Minister of War, and second Minister-Chairman of the government. As a leader of the moderate-socialist Trudoviks faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, he was also vice-chairman of the powerful Petrograd Soviet. Unfortunately, his government was overthrown by the Lenin-led Bolsheviks in the October Revolution on November 7. Kerensky spent the rest of his life in exile, living in Paris and New York City, and worked for the Hoover Institution."}], "output": "  Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War, which ended in 1923."},

It's a terrier breed, which means it's small and energetic. The Scotch Collie is an old breed of dog that originated in Scotland. It used to be one breed, but it was divided into two types: the long-haired (now called Rough Collie) and the short-haired (now called Smooth Collie). The breed is believed to have come from a group of ancient dogs that were brought to Scotland a long time ago, including Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs, and Viking Herding Spitzes. Some of these ancient dogs were also related to Gordon and Irish Setters.The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized dog breed that originated in America. Compared to its cousin, the American Rat Terrier, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is smaller, has shorter legs, and is more muscular. There is a lot of history surrounding the breed's origins, and it shares a common early history with other dog breeds like the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terrier. These early dogs were brought over by immigrants and were used as farm, hunting, and utility dogs, with little to no planned breeding beyond selecting dogs with desirable traits. As a result, the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier has a diverse ancestry that includes the Feist, Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, and other breeds. These early dogs were then bred with Beagle or Beagle-cross dogs to enhance their scenting ability, creating the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with its keen sense of smell, high intellect, and strong desire to please its owners. Despite being aloof with strangers, Teddy Roosevelt Terriers are loyal and affectionate companions who love to be near their owners at all times. Feists are small hunting dogs that originated in the United States from terriers brought over by English miners and other working-class immigrants. These terriers were likely crossbred between the Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, and the now-extinct English White Terrier. These dogs were used for hunting rats, and their owners enjoyed gambling on their rat-killing abilities. Over time, some Feists were crossed with other breeds like Whippets, Italian Greyhounds, and Beagles to create a more diverse group of dogs with different skills and purposes. The English Setter is a medium-sized dog breed. It belongs to the Setter family, which includes other breeds like the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The English Setter has a mainly white coat that's medium in length with long, silky fringes on the back of its legs, under its belly, and on its tail. The coat features flecks of color, and the different color varieties are called belton. The Russian Toy, also known as the Russian Toy Terrier or Russkiy Toy, is a small dog breed originally from Russia. There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth and long. The smooth-coated variety was previously called the Russian Toy Terrier, while the long-coated variety was known as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier. Both were combined under the Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988, and the word Terrier was dropped from the name when the breed was recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 2006. The American Kennel Club registered the breed in its Foundation Stock Service in 2008, allowing it to compete in companion events since 2010. The first official breed standard for both varieties was written in Russia in 1966. The viol, viola da gamba, or informally referred to as gamba, is a family of stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes. These instruments are played with a bow and have frets on the fingerboard to adjust the pitch of the strings. The frets are made of gut and are tied around the neck of the instrument to help the performer stop the strings more cleanly. This improves the consistency of the intonation and gives the stopped notes a tone that matches the open strings better. The viol first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and was popular during the Renaissance and Baroque periods (1600-1750). The viol's ancestors include the Arabic rebab and the medieval European vielle, while later possible ancestors include the Venetian viole and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish vihuela, a plucked instrument tuned like a lute and similar to the present-day viol. The collie is a type of dog that originated in Scotland and Northern England. It's a medium-sized dog with a distinctive white pattern on its shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and they have a strong instinct to herd animals. Over time, collie breeds have spread to many parts of the world, including Australia and North America, and they've developed into different varieties. Some collies are kept as pets or show dogs, while others are used for herding cattle, sheep, and other livestock.

This crucial battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War was a decisive victory for Ethiopia and secured its independence from Italy. Giuseppe Edoardo Arimondi was an Italian general who lived from April 26, 1846, to March 1, 1896. He is best known for his role in the First Italo-Ethiopian War. Among the few European commanders to defeat the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, he soundly defeated them at the Battle of Agordat in 1893. After a long and successful career in colonial service, he died in combat at the Battle of Adwa and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.The First Italo-Ethiopian War took place between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896. It started because the Italians believed a treaty had turned Ethiopia into an Italian protectorate, but the Ethiopian leader, Menelik II, had the support of his people and other nations. Italy was supported by Germany and Austria, but they were surprised to find that Ethiopia was not alone in its fight against the Italian army. Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia, provided military support, including advisers, training, and weapons. Ethiopia also received diplomatic support from the United Kingdom and France to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial power. The war started in 1895, and initial Italian successes were followed by an Ethiopian counterattack and the siege of an Italian fort. The war ended in a decisive defeat for Italy after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army defeated the heavily outnumbered Italians and forced them to retreat back into Eritrea. The relationship between Ethiopia and Japan is the connection between these two countries. Both countries have a long history, and they both successfully defended themselves against European military attacks. Ethiopia won the Battle of Adwa, while Japan won the Battle of Tsushima. As a result, both countries saw each other as potential allies before World War II. Ethiopia is a country located in the Horn of Africa, bordered by several other countries including Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, and Djibouti. It is one of the oldest countries in the world and has a rich history dating back thousands of years. Some of the earliest human traces have been found in Ethiopia, making it an important place in the history of human evolution. According to tradition, the area around present-day Addis Ababa was the starting point for human migration around the world. Ethiopia has been ruled by a series of emperors and princes throughout its history, with the first emperor, Menelik I, ruling in 1000 BC. The country was later divided into smaller regions, but was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II and began Ethiopia's modern history. Ethiopia's borders expanded significantly over the next century, and the country achieved victory over Italian forces in the Battle of Adwa in 1896. Ethiopia was later occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, but was liberated by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces. Saint Ephigenia, also known as Iphigenia of Ethiopia or Iphigenia of Abyssinia, was a virgin saint who lived in the 1st century. According to the Golden Legend, she was converted to Christianity by Saint Matthew the Apostle, who was spreading the Gospel in the region of Ethiopia, which is believed to be located in the areas south of the Caspian Sea. This could have been in one of the provinces of Mesopotamia (such as Assyria and Babylon) or in Ancient Armenia (known as Colchis). Herbert S. Lewis was born on May 8, 1934, and is now an Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. From 1963 to 1998, he taught at this university and conducted extensive field research in Ethiopia. Lewis studied the history of the Oromo (Galla) Kingdom of Jimma Abba Jifar and the daily lives of modern Oromos in Ethiopia in 1958-60 and again in 1965-66. Many of his photos from these trips can be found in the University of Wisconsin's Digital Library, which is linked below. Lewis's work in Ethiopia focused on political leadership and community organization, as well as ethnohistory and culture history. His book, originally titled A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia, 1830-1932, is a study of the monarchy, the sources of the ruler's power, and its origins. In his second trip to Ethiopia in 1965-66, Lewis focused on the role of spirit mediums, known as k'allu, who played a significant role in organizing religious life and conflict resolution in rural areas. In Ethiopia and among Ethiopian and Eritrean communities abroad, the term P'ent'ay is commonly used to refer to Christians who belong to a Protestant denomination. This term was coined in the 1960s and initially used as an insult towards churches that emphasized the Pentecostal experience. Today, it is used to describe any Protestant Christian who is not a member of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo or Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo churches. The term P'ent'ay is a shortened version of Pentecostal, but it is often used to refer to all Protestant Christians, including those who are not actual Pentecostals. Some Orthodox Christians may also use this term to refer to the small Catholic population in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, there are four major Protestant denominations: Word of Life (Kale Heywet), Place of Jesus (Mekane Yesus), Lutheran, Full Gospel (Mulu Wongel), and Christ Foundation (Meserete Kristos) or Mennonite. Some of these communities, particularly Mekane Yesus, have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which represents traditional Ethiopian Christianity. However, most P'ent'ay communities are distinctly Pentecostal in their worship and theology. In December 1893, the Second Battle of Agordat took place between Italian colonial troops and Sudanese Mahdists. Emir Ahmed Ali led a force of approximately 10-12,000 men from eastern Sudan to confront the Italian forces, who were stationed at Agordat, west of Asmara. The Italian commander, Colonel Arimondi, had around 2,400 soldiers and Eritrean askaris. The two sides clashed in fierce fighting, resulting in the deaths of over 1,000 Dervishes, including the Emir himself. The outcome of the battle was: In 1896, the Treaty of Addis Ababa was signed, bringing an end to the First Italo-Ethiopian War. This treaty was more beneficial to Ethiopia than the initial secret agreement between the two countries that was negotiated shortly after the decisive Battle of Adwa in March of the same year. At Adwa, Ethiopian forces led by Menelik II defeated the Italians, and as part of the treaty, the Italians agreed to abandon the Treaty of Wuchale and recognize Ethiopia as an independent nation."}], "output": "  Giuseppe Arimondi died in the Battle of Adwa in 1896, which secured Ethiopia's independence from Italy."},

The President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate is the second-highest-ranking official in the Senate. According to the US Constitution, the Vice President of the United States, who is not a Senator, serves as the President of the Senate, but the Senate must choose a President Pro Tempore to act in the Vice President's absence. Unlike the Vice President, the President Pro Tempore is an elected Senator and can participate in any debate or vote in the Senate. The President Pro Tempore is selected by the Senate as a whole and has certain privileges and limited powers. When the Vice President is not present, the President Pro Tempore is authorized to preside over Senate sessions. However, in practice, the Vice President and President Pro Tempore usually do not preside over Senate sessions, and instead, junior Senators from the majority party rotate the duty of presiding officer to gain experience in parliamentary procedure.

Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925, which required government contractors to treat all employees and job applicants equally, regardless of their race, religion, color, or national origin.

Yellowcraig is bordered by the Firth of Forth to the north, the village of Dirleton and Dirleton Castle to the south, the North Berwick West Links golf course to the east, and the Archerfield Estate and Links golf courses to the west. Dirleton Castle is a medieval fortress located in the village of Dirleton, East Lothian, Scotland. It's about 2 miles west of North Berwick and around 19 miles east of Edinburgh. The castle's oldest parts date back to the 13th century, and it was abandoned by the end of the 17th century.Lothian and Borders is a region in southeastern Scotland that includes several areas: East Lothian, City of Edinburgh, Midlothian, and West Lothian, collectively known as Lothian. Additionally, the region also includes the Scottish Borders. The Scottish Borders, also known as The Mairches or The Marches, is one of 32 council areas in Scotland. It shares borders with several other council areas in Scotland, including the City of Edinburgh, Dumfries and Galloway, East Lothian, Midlothian, South Lanarkshire, and West Lothian. In addition, the Scottish Borders also borders Northumberland in England to the south and east. The administrative center of the area is located in Newtown St Boswells. Dirleton Kirk is located in the village of Dirleton, which is situated to the north of the village green in East Lothian, Scotland. Dirleton is situated 21 miles east of Edinburgh and 2 miles west of North Berwick on the A198 road. The church's grid reference is [NT512842]. Dirleton is a village and parish located in East Lothian, Scotland, about 20 miles east of Edinburgh along the A198. The village has an area of approximately 7500 acres. Dirleton is situated between North Berwick to the east, Gullane to the west, Fenton Barns to the south, and the Yellowcraigs nature reserve, Archerfield Estate, and the Firth of Forth to the north. In 1612, the parish of Gullane was joined to Dirleton through an Act of Parliament because Gullane was an old and decaying town, while Dirleton was thriving. The Royal Burgh of Haddington (Scots: Haidintoun) is a town in East Lothian, Scotland. It serves as the main administrative, cultural, and geographical center for East Lothian, which was officially known as the county of Haddingtonshire from 1889 to 1921 due to late-nineteenth century Scottish local government reforms. Haddington is located about 20 miles east of Edinburgh. The name Haddington dates back to the sixth or seventh century AD, when the area was part of the kingdom of Bernicia. The town became part of Scotland in the tenth century after being ceded by King Edgar of England. Haddington was granted burghal status, one of the earliest to do so, during the reign of David I (1124–1153), which allowed it to conduct trade and grow into a market town. Lord Haliburton of Dirleton (also spelled Dirletoun) was a Scottish noble title created around 1450 for Sir Walter de Haliburton, who was the Lord High Treasurer of Scotland. The seat of Lord Haliburton was located at Dirleton Castle in the present-day East Lothian region of Scotland. St. Mary's Priory in North Berwick, Scotland was a medieval monastery of nuns founded by Earl Donnchad I of Fife around 1150. The priory lasted for over four centuries until the Scottish Reformation, when it declined and eventually disappeared. The priory was endowed by both the Earls of Carrick and the Earls of Fife, but over time, it became controlled by the local Home (or Hume) family, who eventually acquired the priory's lands as a free barony. John David Home Robertson was born on December 5, 1948, and is a politician from Scotland who belongs to the Labour party. From 1978 to 2001, he served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Berwick and East Lothian and East Lothian. Additionally, from 1999 to 2007, he was a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for East Lothian."}], "output": "  The coastal area bordered by Dirleton Castle on the south side is the Firth of Forth.**"},

The set comes in either 4 compact discs or 5 vinyl LPs and features a variety of songs produced by Spector. The first song, To Know Him Is to Love Him, was released in 1958 and was performed by Spector as part of the group The Teddy Bears. The box set includes a booklet with photos, song lyrics, and information about the songs, as well as a small red pin. The song 'To Know Him Is to Love Him' was written and inspired by Phil Spector, who saw the words 'To Know Him Was To Love Him' on his father's tombstone. The song was first recorded by Phil's vocal group, the Teddy Bears, and reached the top of the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart for three weeks in 1958. Later, other artists such as Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton covered the song and changed the title and lyrics to 'To Know You Is to Love You.' In 1987, the song was revived by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt, and Emmylou Harris, who recorded a version that topped the U.S. country singles charts. The song is written in 12/8 time.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.The Trash Box is a 5-CD box set containing mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings by American bands. It's similar to the earlier Pebbles Box, which was a 5-LP set, and includes almost all of the same songs in the same order. However, the Trash Box has some extra bonus tracks at the end of each CD. These tracks are from the first five volumes of the Pebbles series, which were released by AIP Records. However, the tracks on the Trash Box are different from the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in those volumes. Some of the songs on the Trash Box have never been released anywhere else in the Pebbles series. For example, the well-known song I Fought the Law (but the Law Won) by the Bobby Fuller Four is on the Trash Box, but it's replaced the less common song Wine Wine Wine by Bobby Fuller on Pebbles, Volume 2. In 2003, the American blues-rock band ZZ Top released a box set called Chrome, Smoke & BBQ. This set was notable because it featured the original mixes of all the tracks from the band's first five albums, which had never been released on CD before. At the time, these were the only CD releases that included original mixes from ZZ Top's first album, Rio Grande Mud, and Tejas, aside from a 1977 compilation called The Best of ZZ Top which featured a few tracks from those albums. In 2006, two of the band's albums, Tres Hombres and Fandango!, were reissued with their original mixes. Finally, in 2013, the band's entire studio album catalog from 1970 to 1990 was released in a box set called The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990, which included all ten of their studio albums with their original mixes. John Coltrane's Live in Japan is a four-disc box set featuring his final group, which included his wife and pianist Alice Coltrane, saxophonist and bass clarinetist Pharoah Sanders, bassist Jimmy Garrison, and drummer Rashied Ali. The set compiles all the music issued on three albums in the 1970s, including Concert in Japan (1973), Coltrane in Japan (1974), and Second Night in Tokyo (1976). Some of this material was also reissued in 1980 as two 2-LP sets called Coltrane in Tokyo Vol. 1 and Coltrane in Tokyo Vol. 2. The first CD issues were released in Japan as two 2-CD sets called Live in Japan Vol. 1 (the same as Coltrane in Japan) and Live in Japan Vol. 2 (the same as Second Night in Tokyo). The US 4-CD edition includes both of these volumes, with the same mastering as the original mono tapes. The interview on side six of Second Night in Tokyo has never been reissued on any CD edition. Nashville Rebel is a box set by Waylon Jennings, released in 2006 through Legacy Recordings. This collection is the first comprehensive retrospective of Jennings' career, spanning 92 songs recorded between 1958 and 1994. The album features a range of songs from different phases of Jennings' career, including his early recordings with Buddy Holly, his years on RCA Records, and his later work at Epic Records. The box set includes many of Jennings' chart-topping singles, as well as collaborations with other notable artists such as Willie Nelson and The Highwaymen. One notable inclusion is an unreleased duet with Johnny Cash, The Greatest Cowboy of Them All, which was later recorded by Cash alone for two of his albums. The box set comes with a 140-page booklet and liner notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye. Radiohead Box Set is a collection of the band's first six studio albums and one live album, released on December 10, 2007. It's available in three formats: a seven-CD box set, a digital download, or a 4GB USB stick. The box set reached #95 on the album charts in Canada. Mono Masters is a Beatles album that features all of the band's mono mixes, which were only available on some of their releases. This album is a compilation of the mono mixes, and it's different from another album called Past Masters. The reason for this difference is that Mono Masters only includes songs that were mixed for the mono format, while Past Masters includes songs that were mixed for both mono and stereo.\n\nThe track list on Mono Masters is different from Past Masters on the second half of the second disc. This is because some of the later songs, like Old Brown Shoe, The Ballad of John and Yoko, and Let It Be, didn't have a mono mix, so they're not on Mono Masters. Instead, the album includes songs from stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes.\n\nTracks 9-12 and 15 were going to be released as a 7-inch mono EP in 1969, but the project was cancelled. These songs were only released in stereo and in a special mix called a fold-down of the stereo mix. Get Back (with the B-side Don't Let Me Down) was the last Beatles single mixed for the mono format, and it was released in the UK in mono, but not in the US. So, songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are not on Mono Masters. In 1993, Atlantic Records released a double album called Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2. This album features the rest of the English rock band Led Zeppelin's music that was not included in a previous 4-CD box set called Led Zeppelin, which was released in 1990. All of the songs in the box set have been digitally remastered, including a previously unreleased studio track called Baby Come On Home. A 54-page booklet is also included with the release, which features every track from the band's nine studio albums, as well as two live recordings from the BBC, the band's only non-LP b-side, and one studio outtake. In total, this box set covers all of the band's music. The Doors' Vinyl Box Set is the band's seventh box set, featuring remastered versions of their six original albums on 7 records. The release was originally planned for October 2007, but was delayed until February 2008 due to issues with the vinyl and other production problems. The delay was caused by faulty test pressings, concerns about the quality of the artwork for the album L.A. Woman, and problems with the vinyl itself, which required the team to search for a new source of high-quality virgin vinyl."}], "output": "  The song \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\" was written and inspired by Phil Spector, who saw the words \"To Know Him Was To Love Him\" on his father's tombstone.

The Permanent Secretariat, a non-profit organization based in Rome, organizes the Summit every year and is run by a team of volunteers. So far, the Permanent Secretariat has organized 16 Summits, with the most recent one taking place in February 2017 in Bogota, Colombia, which was the first time the Summit was held in Latin America. Mikhail Gorbachev was a former leader of the Soviet Union. He was born on March 2, 1931, and became the eighth and final leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, serving as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union until 1991. He was the country's head of state from 1988 until 1991, holding various titles including Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and finally, Soviet Union.Nikolai Viktorovich Podgorny was a prominent Soviet statesman during the Cold War. He held important positions within the Communist Party of Ukraine, including First Secretary of the Central Committee from 1957 to 1963 and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 1965 to 1977. In 1977, he was replaced as Chairman of the Presidium by General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev. Podgorny also lost his seat in the powerful Politburo (a group of top party leaders) that same year and was forced to retire from active politics.   Andrei Pavlovich Kirilenko was a prominent Soviet leader from the early years of the Cold War until its end in 1990. Born in Alexeyevka, Belgorod Oblast, in 1906 to a working-class Ukrainian family, Kirilenko graduated from a vocational school in the 1920s and the Rybinsk Aviation Technology Institute in the mid-to-late 1930s. He joined the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1930 and rose through the ranks of the Soviet hierarchy, becoming Vice-Chairman of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) by the 1960s. After Nikita Khrushchev's ouster, Kirilenko became Leonid Brezhnev's right-hand man within the Central Committee. In 1958, the Soviet Union's Black Sea Shipping Company built a ocean liner called MS Excelsior Neptune, originally named Feliks Dzerzhinskiy. This ship was constructed in East Germany by a company called VEB Mathias-Thesen Werft. The ship was one of a series called the Mikhail Kalinin, named after a Soviet statesman and founder of the Soviet secret police (Cheka).   Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov was a key figure in the Soviet government during the Cold War. He served as Second Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1965 and was essentially the party's Chief Ideologue, or top thinker, until his death in 1982. Suslov was in charge of ensuring that the party was run democratically and that power was divided appropriately within the party. He was known for being very resistant to change, which made him one of the most prominent anti-reformist leaders in the Soviet government. Ephraim Sklyansky was a prominent Soviet statesman who was born in 1892 and died in 1925. He joined the Bolsheviks during his time at medical school in Kiev and quickly became involved in the party's clandestine activities. After the October Revolution, he served as deputy to Leon Trotsky on the Revolutionary Military Council, where he helped improve the fighting capacity of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War. In 1924, his position was taken over by Mikhail Frunze, and Sklyansky was made chairman of the Mossukno state textile trust. The following year, he went on a tour of Europe to gather technical information, but he died in a boating accident on Long Lake in New York in 1925. Some people believe that Sklyansky was killed on Stalin's orders, and that the accident was organized by Genrikh Yagoda. Anastas Ivanovich Mikoyan was a prominent Soviet politician who served the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for many years. He was born on November 25, 1895, and died on October 21, 1978. Mikoyan was an Old Bolshevik, which means he was one of the early members of the Communist Party and had been involved in Soviet politics since the time of Vladimir Lenin. Throughout the reigns of Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev, and Brezhnev, Mikoyan held important positions within the party and government. Amazingly, he was able to maintain his influence and power within the party even as the leadership changed hands multiple times. Mikoyan retired from politics after the early days of Brezhnev's rule, marking the end of a long and distinguished career in Soviet politics.   David Jonathan Waksberg was born in New York City in 1956 and became a prominent activist in the Soviet Jewry Movement during the 1980s and early 1990s. In the 1970s, he became involved with the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry, and later, he worked for the Bay Area Council for Soviet Jews (BACSJ) as Assistant Director and then Executive Director. Waksberg's work with BACSJ involved coordinating aid and support for Refuseniks and Prisoners of Conscience in the Soviet Union, organizing protest demonstrations and vigils to raise awareness of the plight of Jews in the USSR, and establishing a network of human rights and emigration bureaus in former Soviet Union cities. In 1990, Waksberg became Director of the Center for Jewish Renewal, a new organization established by UCSJ to promote the development and emigration rights of Jews in the former Soviet Union. From 1995 to 2007, Waksberg served on the Board of Directors of the Bay Area Council and directed Development and Communication for UCSJ. Currently, he serves as Executive Director of the Bureau of Jewish Education of San Francisco. Sergo Anastasi Mikoyan (Armenian: Սերգո Անաստասի Միկոյան, Russian: Сергo Анаста́сович Микоян) was one of the most prominent historians in the Soviet Union, specializing in the foreign policies of the Soviet Union and the United States in Latin America.

It contains approximately 700 species, making it the largest genus in the family. These plants are commonly known as campion or catchfly. Many Silene species are found in many parts of the world, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Ferocactus is a group of large, barrel-shaped cacti with sharp spines and small flowers. There are about 30 different species of Ferocactus found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.Silene latifolia, also known as the white campion, is a plant that grows in Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa. It's a member of the Caryophyllaceae family and can be either an annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial. The plant can grow up to 80 centimeters tall and is sometimes called bladder campion in the USA. It's important to note that Silene latifolia should not be confused with Silene vulgaris, which is also called bladder campion but is more common in the plant's name. Silene tomentosa, also known as the Gibraltar campion, is a rare and unique flowering plant. It belongs to the genus Silene and the family Caryophyllaceae. This woody perennial plant grows to be about 40 centimeters tall and has bilobed flowers that range in color from light pink to pale violet. What makes it really special is that it's only found in Gibraltar, making it endemic to that region. Silene conoidea is a type of flowering plant that belongs to the pink family. It's commonly called weed silene or large sand catchfly. This plant is originally from Eurasia, but it's also found in other parts of the world, like western North America, where it's considered a weed. It's an annual herb that can grow up to 1 meter tall, with a hairy and partially glandular stem. The leaves are lance-shaped and can be up to 12 centimeters long near the base of the plant, while the leaves towards the top are smaller. The flower is surrounded by a hairy and glandular calyx (a part of the flower) that's ridged with many veins. When the calyx opens up, five bright pink petals are revealed. Silene stenophylla is a type of flowering plant that belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family. It's often called narrow-leafed campion. This plant is found in the Arctic tundra of eastern Siberia and Northern Japan. Scientists have discovered frozen samples of this plant that are around 32,000 years old in the same area where it's still found today. In 2012, a team of scientists was able to grow a new plant from these old samples using a process called radiocarbon dating. Silene menziesii is a type of flowering plant that is commonly known as Menzies' campion or Menzies' catchfly. It is found in western North America, from Alaska to the southwestern United States, and can grow in various habitats. This plant is variable in size and shape, with some versions growing as perennial herbs, while others are more shrub-like. The plant has small, hairy leaves that are opposite each other and are typically around 1-2 inches long. The flowers are clustered at the top of the stem or in the leaf axils, and are encased in a hairy, veined calyx. Each flower has two white petals with two lobes at the end. Interestingly, the plant is dioecious, meaning that male and female versions of the plant produce different flowers. Male flowers have fewer stamen, while female flowers have fewer stigma. Silene suksdorfii is a type of flowering plant that's part of the pink family. It's also known as Suksdorf's silene, Suksdorf's catchfly, and Cascade alpine campion. This plant is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it grows in high mountain slopes and forested subalpine areas. It's an alpine plant, meaning it lives in places with limited sunlight and harsh conditions.\n\nThe plant has a thick, woody base called a caudex that produces several tall, hairy stems. Each stem can grow up to 10 or 15 centimeters tall and has sticky areas on the upper parts. The leaves are clustered around the caudex and are covered in soft hairs. The plant produces small, solitary flowers that are encased in a purple-veined calyx. The petals are white or purple-tinged and have two lobes at the tips and small appendages at the bases.\n\nOverall, Silene suksdorfii is a unique and interesting plant that's well adapted to the challenging conditions of its mountain habitat. Silene antirrhina is a type of flowering plant that belongs to the pink family. It's commonly known as the sleepy silene or sleepy catchfly. This plant is originally from the Americas, where it can be found in many parts of North and South America. However, it has also been introduced to Europe, where it is now found in some areas. Silene is a type of flowering plant that has evolved to have two different reproductive systems, called dioecy. This means that male and female reproductive organs are found on separate plants. Silene has sex chromosomes that are XY, which means that the sex of the offspring is determined by the Y chromosome. Scientists are interested in studying Silene because it is one of only 39 species of flowering plants that have sex-determining genes, and it can produce offspring with a wide range of reproductive systems. By studying Silene, scientists can learn more about how sex determination works in plants and how it can help us understand the evolution of sex chromosomes."}], "output": "  Yes, Ferocactus and Silene are both types of plants.\n\nFerocactus is a genus of large, barrel-shaped cacti with sharp spines and small flowers, found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.\n\nSilene, on the other hand, is a genus of flowering plants that belongs to the family Caryophyllaceae.

The squadron was formed in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps and has flown various types of aircraft throughout its history, including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) planes. During World War I, the squadron operated in France and conducted fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions. After the war, the squadron was disbanded in 1919 but was re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF. The squadron saw action in World War II as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific and later flew English Electric Canberra jets in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. The squadron was disbanded again in 1982 after retiring the Canberra jets. It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C Wedgetail. In 2014, one of the squadron's Boeing 737s was deployed to the Middle East as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS. In the 1950s, the English Electric Canberra was a British jet-powered medium bomber that was developed in response to a 1944 Air Ministry request for a successor to the de Havilland Mosquito, a fast-bomber used during World War II. The Canberra was designed to have exceptional high-altitude bombing capabilities and high speeds, which were achieved through the use of new jet propulsion technology. When it first entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) in May 1951, the Canberra became the RAF's first jet-powered bomber aircraft.During World War II, the South West Pacific theatre was a key region of conflict between the Allies and Japan. This area included several countries and territories in the Pacific, such as the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (except for the island of Sumatra), Borneo, Australia, and the mandate Territory of New Guinea (which included the Bismarck Archipelago). The Allied powers defined this region as the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command. During World War II, the United States had military operations in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater. This theater was the site of U.S. military activities from 1941 to 1945, during the Pacific War. Initially, there were two U.S. operational commands in the Pacific: the Pacific Ocean Areas (POA) and the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). Admiral Chester W. Nimitz was in charge of the POA, which was divided into three areas: the Central Pacific Area, the North Pacific Area, and the South Pacific Area. General Douglas MacArthur led the SWPA. In 1945, the United States added the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, which was commanded by General Carl A. Spaatz. The Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 Sparviero was a three-engine Italian medium bomber with a wooden and metal structure. Initially designed as a fast passenger plane, it set 26 world records for speed between 1937 and 1939, making it the fastest medium bomber in the world at the time. The Sparviero saw action in various conflicts, including the Spanish Civil War and World War II, flying on all fronts where Italy was involved. It proved to be an effective torpedo bomber in the Mediterranean theater and became well-known as one of the most recognizable Italian planes of the war. Crews affectionately nicknamed it il gobbo maledetto (the damned hunchback) due to its distinctive fuselage hump. During World War II, the Allies had four main military commands in the Pacific. One of these was the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), which was the name given to the supreme military command in the South West Pacific Theatre. This area included several countries in the Pacific, such as the Philippines, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies (except for Sumatra), East Timor, Australia, the Territories of Papua and New Guinea, and a part of the Solomon Islands. The SWPA was primarily made up of US and Australian forces, but other Allied countries like the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom also had troops serving there. During the late 1940s, the Soviet Union's Tupolev Design Bureau developed a new jet-powered bomber called the Tu-12 (also known as the Tu-77). This aircraft was an experimental design that built upon the success of the Tupolev Tu-2, a piston-engined bomber that had been used during World War II. The Tu-12 was intended to help the Soviet military and Tupolev themselves become familiar with the unique challenges of flying a jet-powered bomber.

During World War II, a group of Allied military intelligence operatives called the Coastwatchers or Coast Watch Organisation were stationed on remote Pacific islands. Their job was to keep an eye on enemy movements and rescue stranded Allied personnel. They played a crucial role in the Pacific Ocean and South West Pacific theaters, serving as an early warning system during the Guadalcanal campaign. In other words, they helped protect Allied forces by providing vital information about enemy movements and activities, and rescuing Allied soldiers who were stranded or in danger.   Edwin A.

The Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 was an annual NASCAR Sprint Cup race held at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina. The race was first held in May 1952 as a 100-mile event, but it didn't become a regular fixture on the NASCAR schedule until 1957, when it was renamed the Rebel 300 and held over 300 miles. The race was later expanded to 400 miles in 1966 and then to 500 miles in 1973. However, in 2005, the race was reduced to 400 miles as part of a settlement in a lawsuit and a schedule realignment. The famous Southern 500 race, which was previously held on a different date, was moved to Mother's Day weekend, and the 400-mile race was eliminated. Despite this, Dodge's sponsorship was transferred to the 500-mile race. The Louis Schwitzer Award is given each year to an engineer or team of engineers who have demonstrated exceptional innovation in developing new technology for the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race.

He was known for his powerful voice and his ability to sing complex roles with ease. He was particularly famous for his performances in the spinto and dramatic tenor roles, which are the most challenging and prestigious roles for tenors. Corelli was called the Prince of tenors because of his handsome appearance and charismatic stage presence, which won over audiences everywhere he performed. He worked with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City for many years, and also performed at many of the world's most famous opera houses. He was a very popular and respected singer, and his legacy continues to be celebrated by opera lovers around the world. Tosca is a 1956 Italian musical movie directed by Carmine Gallone and starring Franca Duval, Afro Poli, and Franco Corelli. It is based on the opera Tosca by famous composer Giacomo Puccini. The film was made at Cinecittà, a famous movie studio in Rome, Italy.Ron Bottcher (May 11, 1940 - April 12, 1991) was an American opera singer who performed with two of the most prestigious opera companies in the United States during the 1960s: the New York City Opera (NYCO) and the Metropolitan Opera. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Bottcher earned degrees in music from the University of Montana and the Curtis Institute of Music. He made his opera debut at the Santa Fe Opera in 1961, where he sang roles in three operas: Richard Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier, Giacomo Puccini's La bohème, and Paul Hindemith's Neues vom Tage. At the NYCO, Bottcher sang roles such as Escamillo in Bizet's Carmen and Sharpless in Puccini's Madama Butterfly. He also created roles in the world premieres of two operas at the Metropolitan Opera: Samuel Barber's Antony and Cleopatra and Marvin David Levy's Mourning Becomes Electra. Tragically, Bottcher died at the age of 50 due to complications from AIDS. La Bohème, also known as La Bohème de Puccini, is a 1988 Italian-French film adaptation of an opera directed by Luigi Comencini. The film is based on Giacomo Puccini's famous opera of the same name. Gianni Schicchi is a funny opera written by Giacomo Puccini in 1917-1918. The words are based on a story from Dante's Divine Comedy. It's the last part of a group of three operas called Il trittico (The Triptych), which were written to be performed together. Although it's often performed alone or with other short operas, Gianni Schicchi is now more commonly shown on its own or with other operas by different composers. One of Puccini's most famous arias, O mio babbino caro, is also one of the most well-known arias in all of opera. O mio babbino caro is a beautiful soprano aria from Puccini's opera Gianni Schicchi, which was composed in 1918. The opera's libretto, written by Giovacchino Forzano, tells the story of a young woman named Lauretta who is in love with a boy named Rinuccio. However, their relationship is threatened when tensions between Lauretta's father and Rinuccio's family escalate to the point of breaking. In this emotional moment, Lauretta sings O mio babbino caro, a heartfelt and simple love song that contrasts with the opera's otherwise complex and dramatic plot. This aria is the only solo piece in the opera and provides a brief moment of peace and tranquility amidst the opera's overall theme of hypocrisy, jealousy, and feuding in medieval Florence. Giacomo Puccini's opera, La fanciulla del West (The Girl of the West), is based on a play by David Belasco and premiered in 1910. This opera is unique because it has fewer show-stopping moments compared to Puccini's other works, but it's admired for its impressive orchestration and a score that's more melodically integrated. Some people have noticed similarities between the opera's libretto and the works of Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss, but it's important to remember that the opera remains distinctly Italian in style. Additionally, some have pointed out similarities between the libretto and the work of Richard Wagner, but it's largely due to the original plot of the play and not necessarily an imitation of Wagner's style. The Puccini Festival is an annual summer opera event held in July and August. It celebrates the music of Giacomo Puccini, a famous Italian composer, by performing his operas. The festival takes place every year in the summer, bringing together opera enthusiasts from around the world to enjoy Puccini's beautiful works. Cesira Ferrani (born May 8, 1863 in Turin, Italy - died May 4, 1943 in Pollone) was a legendary Italian operatic soprano who made history by debuting two of opera's most iconic roles. In 1896, she brought to life the character of Mimì in the original production of Giacomo Puccini's La bohème, and in 1893, she premiered the title role in Puccini's Manon Lescaut. Ferrani's impressive vocal range allowed her to perform a diverse array of operas, including works by Verdi, Gounod, Wagner, and Debussy. Jacopo (also known as Giacomo) Puccini was an Italian composer who lived in the 18th century. He was born on January 26, 1712, and passed away on May 16, 1781. Interestingly, he was the first of five generations of composers in his family, with his most famous great-great-grandson being the famous opera composer Giacomo Puccini."}], "output": "  The city where the Prince of tenors, Franco Corelli, starred in a film based on an opera by Giacomo Puccini is Rome, Italy."},

The PNG Solution is a policy implemented by the Australian government in 2013 to deal with people who arrive in Australia by boat without a visa. If they are found to be genuine refugees, they will be sent to Papua New Guinea to be processed and resettled. If they are not found to be refugees, they will be sent back to their home country or detained indefinitely. The policy involves expanding an immigration detention facility on Manus Island, where refugees will be sent to be processed first. The policy was announced by the Australian Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea in response to a growing number of boat arrivals. Some people, including the opposition leader at the time, supported the policy, while others, including human rights groups, protested it.

This happens when the rear of the car turns more than the front, causing the front wheels to point in the opposite direction of the turn. This is known as oversteering. When this happens, the driver needs to use the steering wheel in the opposite direction of the turn to maintain control of the car, which is called counter-steering. This technique is often used in racing and stunt driving to create a dramatic and impressive turn. D1NZ is the premier drifting series in New Zealand, serving as a clubsport advanced event under MotorSport New Zealand. It was established in 2003 as a small competition among drifting teams from different parts of the country to organize and regulate drifting events. Over the years, the series has grown bigger and more professional, featuring professional drivers with sponsored cars. The series now consists of two championships: Pro and Pro-sport. New competitors typically need to prove themselves in the Pro-sport championship before moving up to the Pro championship, unless they come from an equivalent international series. The organizers aim to promote and educate drifting in New Zealand while providing a safe and regulated environment for competitors. It's important to note that D1NZ is not related to the Japanese D1 Grand Prix series, and it's actually the longest running drifting series in the world.Raimund Harmstorf was a famous German actor born in Hamburg on October 7, 1939.

After his playing career ended, Herock went on to work in player personnel for several NFL teams, including the Raiders, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Atlanta Falcons. Perhaps his most notable move was trading Brett Favre from the Falcons to the Green Bay Packers, at the urging of head coach Jerry Glanville. The Atlanta Falcons played in their 25th season in the National Football League (NFL) in 1990. The team hired a new coach named Jerry Glanville, and they changed their helmets from red to black. The Falcons wanted to do better than their poor 3-13 record from the previous season, so they worked hard to improve. Although they didn't make the playoffs for the eighth year in a row, they did have some good wins early in the season, including against teams that were playoff contenders. Unfortunately, the team lost seven games in a row and ended the season with a disappointing 5-11 record. The Falcons played well at home, going 5-3, but they struggled on the road, going winless, which hurt their chances of making the postseason.

Most of these species are native to Europe, Asia, and Africa, but two species can be found in southeastern Australia. These plants grow to be between 5 and 50 centimeters tall and have opposite leaves. Cypress is a type of tree or shrub that grows in northern temperate regions. It belongs to the family Cupressaceae. The word cypress comes from the Old French word cipres, which was borrowed from Latin cypressus. The Latin word is a Latinization of the Greek word κυπάρισσος (kyparissos).Fokienia is a type of conifer tree that belongs to the cypress family. It's similar to other trees in the genera of Chamaecyparis and Calocedrus, but it has some unique characteristics that set it apart. Genetically, Fokienia is closest to Chamaecyparis, but not all scientists agree that it's a separate genus. There are only two species of Fokienia: the living species, Fokienia hodginsii (also known as the Fujian cypress), and one fossil species called Fokienia ravenscragensis. The Frenchman Formation is a geological unit in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin that's about 65 million years old, during the Late Cretaceous period. It's found in southern Saskatchewan and the Cypress Hills of southeastern Alberta. In 1942, a geologist named G.M. Furnival first described the formation based on observations of rock outcrops along the Frenchman River, between Ravenscrag and Highway 37. The Frenchman Formation is known for containing the youngest dinosaur genera, similar to the famous Hell Creek Formation in the United States. The genus Cupressus is one of several genera in the family Cupressaceae that are called cypress. However, there are other genera in this family that are also called cypress. It's important to note that this group is not a monophyletic (meaning it doesn't include all descendants of a single common ancestor) but rather a polyphyletic (meaning it includes multiple groups of descendants that shared a common ancestor). Genetic and morphological analysis has shown that the Cupressus genus belongs to the Cupressoideae subfamily. The common name cypress comes from the Old French word cipres and the Latin cyparissus, which is a Latinization of the Greek word κυπάρισσος (kypárissos). Cedrol is a type of molecule found in the essential oils of certain plants, including conifers like cypress and juniper. It's also been found in a related plant called oregano. Cedrol is important in the production of aroma compounds, and it makes up a significant portion of cedarwood oil in Texas and Virginia. In Texas, it makes up about 19% of cedarwood oil, while in Virginia, it makes up about 15.8%. Libocedrus is a group of five tree species in the cypress family (Cupressaceae) that are native to New Zealand and New Caledonia. These trees are closely related to other genera in South America and New Guinea, including Pilgerodendron and Austrocedrus. In the past, some botanists included these genera within Libocedrus, but they are now known to be distinct. The name Libocedrus means teardrop cedar, likely referring to the resin droplets that can be found on the trees. The genus Pilgerodendron belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae) and has only one species, Pilgerodendron uviferum. This species is unique because it is only found in the Valdivian temperate rainforests and Magellanic subpolar forests of southern Chile and southwestern Argentina. These forests are located between 40° and 55° south latitude, and Pilgerodendron is the southernmost conifer in the world. Interestingly, it is part of a group of genera called subfamily Callitroideae, which are found only in the southern hemisphere and are associated with the Antarctic flora. Cypress-pine refers to three related plant genera in the cypress family (Cupressaceae). These genera are: Cypress (Cupressus), Callitris, and Chamaecyparis. All of these plants are conifers, which means they have needle-like leaves and produce cones. They are commonly found in warm and subtropical regions around the world. Ajugeae is a group of plants in the Teucrioideae subfamily of the Lamiaceae family. This group includes several genera, such as Acrymia, Ajuga, Cymaria, Garrettia, and Holocheila."}], "output": "  Based on the given passage, both Cypress and Ajuga are genera.\n\nCypress is a type of tree or shrub that belongs to the family Cupressaceae, while Ajuga is a group of 40 plant species that belong to the mint family (Lamiaceae)."},

They had a good draft in 1992, selecting center Alonzo Mourning from Georgetown with the second overall pick. Mourning joined forces with second-year player Larry Johnson and point guard Muggsy Bogues, but the team struggled most of the season with a losing record. However, they finished strong, winning 9 of their last 12 games and finishing third in their division with a 44-38 record, qualifying for their first playoff appearance ever. In the playoffs, the Hornets made history by winning a series against the Boston Celtics on a buzzer-beating shot by Mourning. Unfortunately, they were eliminated in the semifinals by the New York Knicks in five games. Tyrone Curtis Muggsy Bogues was born on January 9, 1965, and is an American former professional basketball player. He is the shortest player in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA), standing at just 5 feet tall. During his 14-year career in the NBA, Bogues played point guard for four teams: the Charlotte Hornets, Washington Bullets, Golden State Warriors, and Toronto Raptors. He is most famous for his time with the Charlotte Hornets, where he played for ten seasons. After his playing career, Bogues went on to coach the now-defunct WNBA team, the Charlotte Sting.The Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. They play in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team was originally established in 1988 as an expansion team, but then moved to New Orleans after the 2001-02 season. In 2004, a new team called the Charlotte Bobcats was created. Ten years later, the team changed its name back to the Charlotte Hornets, after the New Orleans franchise changed its name to the Pelicans. This means that the Charlotte franchise is actually a continuation of the original Hornets team that existed from 1988 to 2002. The Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball team, representing Texas Tech University, has had nine players drafted into the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) since the league began holding drafts in 1997. Sheryl Swoopes was the first player from Texas Tech to be drafted into the WNBA, selected in the very first player allocation in 1997. Interestingly, the Charlotte Sting has drafted more Texas Tech players than any other WNBA franchise, with three players being selected - Michi Atkins in the WNBA Elite Draft, Angie Braziel and Jia Perkins during the college draft. The Charlotte Hornets were created in 1988 as an expansion team in the National Basketball Association (NBA). They selected players from other teams at the 1988 NBA Expansion Draft, and then picked college players at the 1988 NBA draft five days later. The Hornets played in Charlotte for 14 years before moving to New Orleans in 2002. Two years after the Hornets left, a new team called the Charlotte Bobcats was established in 2004. The Bobcats held their expansion draft and first NBA draft in 2004, and the franchise's name was changed back to the Hornets in 2014, after the New Orleans Pelicans renamed themselves. The records and history of the original Charlotte Hornets were transferred to the new team. Ayana D'Nay Walker is a former American women's basketball player who was born on September 10, 1979. She played for the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters team from 1998 to 2002 and was a member of the USA Basketball Women's National Team that won gold medals in 2001 and 2001 World University Games. Walker was drafted by the Detroit Shock in the 2002 WNBA Draft and won the 2003 WNBA Championship with the team. She later played for the Charlotte Sting and Los Angeles Sparks before retiring in 2007. The 2003 WNBA season was the seventh season of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA). This was an important year for the league because it saw some significant changes. For the first time, some teams either moved to new locations or closed down completely. The Orlando Miracle, for example, moved to Connecticut and became the Connecticut Sun, while the Utah Starzz moved to San Antonio, Texas and became the San Antonio Silver Stars. Unfortunately, the Miami Sol and the Portland Fire folded. However, the Charlotte Sting became the second WNBA team without a brother NBA team. The number of games each team played increased from 32 to 34, and the season ended with the Detroit Shock winning their first WNBA Championship. The Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and they play in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team has a complicated history, as there have been two different franchises in Charlotte: the original Hornets, who played from 1988 to 2002, and the Charlotte Bobcats, who started playing in 2004. The original Hornets moved to New Orleans, Louisiana and became the New Orleans Hornets in 2002. The Charlotte Bobcats played for ten seasons before changing their name to the Charlotte Hornets in 2014. As part of a deal between the Hornets, Bobcats, and the NBA, the Hornets were able to reclaim the history and records of the original Hornets from 1988 to 2002, while the records from 2002 to 2013 remained with the New Orleans Pelicans. This means that the Hornets are now considered to have suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, and then resumed play as the Bobcats in 2004. Under this arrangement, all of Charlotte's NBA history is now recognized under one single franchise. The Charlotte Hornets are a professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. They play in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and are part of the Eastern Conference Southeast Division. The team is mostly owned by Michael Jordan, a former NBA player and North Carolina native who bought the team in 2010. The Hornets play their home games at the Spectrum Center in the Uptown area of Charlotte. The Charlotte Hornets' 2014-2015 season was their 25th year in the NBA. This was the team's first year as the Charlotte Hornets since 2002, as they were previously known as the Charlotte Bobcats. In May 2014, the team officially changed its name to the Hornets and reclaimed the team's history and records from the original Charlotte Hornets franchise, which played from 1988-1992. The remaining history of the New Orleans Hornets, which played from 2002-2013, is now owned by the New Orleans Pelicans. The Charlotte Hornets were led by head coach Steve Clifford and assistants Patrick Ewing, Bob Beyer, Stephen Silas, Bob Weiss, and Mark Price."}], "output": "  The former NBA player who was a member of the Charlotte Hornets during their 1992-93 season and was head coach for the WNBA team Charlotte Sting is Eddie Jones."},

Instead of writing happy or sad melodies (themes), Goldsmith created a dark and unsettling soundtrack that fits the film's intense and scary atmosphere. The score has very few romantic parts and is mostly dissonant and unsettling, which adds to the overall feeling of unease in the movie. Alien is a 1979 science fiction horror movie directed by Ridley Scott and starring Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm, and Yaphet Kotto. The film's title refers to a terrifying alien creature that attacks the crew of a spaceship. The movie's screenplay was written by Dan O'Bannon, who drew inspiration from other science fiction and horror works, and co-authored the story with Ronald Shusett. The film was produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler, and Walter Hill through their company Brandywine Productions and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Giler and Hill made changes and additions to the script, while Shusett served as executive producer. The iconic Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by the Swiss artist H.R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the more human elements of the film.Christus Apollo is a beautiful cantata (a musical work in four parts) written by the American composer Jerry Goldsmith. The piece is based on a text by Ray Bradbury, a famous science fiction author, and was commissioned by the California Chamber Symphony in 1969. The cantata was first performed that same year at Royce Hall in UCLA, with the famous actor Charlton Heston serving as the narrator. Heston had previously starred in the 1968 movie Planet of the Apes, for which Goldsmith had composed the music. L.A. Confidential is either the original soundtrack or the original film score of the 1997 movie of the same name. The soundtrack features a mix of songs and source music, while the film score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith and released on Varèse Sarabande Records. The movie starred Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, Danny DeVito, and Kim Basinger, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the film. Innerspace is a 1987 science fiction comedy movie directed by Joe Dante and produced by Michael Finnell. Steven Spielberg, who was a well-known film producer at the time, served as the executive producer. The movie was influenced by the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage, which also dealt with science fiction themes. The film stars Dennis Quaid, Martin Short, and Meg Ryan, along with Robert Picardo and Kevin McCarthy. The movie's music was composed by Jerry Goldsmith, a well-respected composer in the film industry. Innerspace performed well at the box office, earning over $25 million in domestic revenue, and it was the only movie directed by Dante to win an Oscar. The score for the 1986 James Cameron movie Aliens was composed by James Horner. The score includes musical references to a famous piece called Adagio from a ballet suite called Gayane by the composer Aram Khachaturian, which had been used in a different movie directed by Stanley Kubrick in 1968. Horner also used musical motifs, sound treatments, and excerpts from Jerry Goldsmith's original score for the 1979 movie Alien, which was also directed by James Cameron. When Horner couldn't finish some of the cues to Cameron's satisfaction, he used additional cues from Goldsmith's score. However, the film's editors altered the score's order and placed the music out of context, sometimes looping or truncating it. Despite these production issues, the score was nominated for an Academy Award in 1986 and was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra. The soundtrack album was released the following year, in 1987. The soundtrack for the 1998 Disney animated movie Mulan is called Mulan: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack. This album was released by Walt Disney Records on June 2, 1998 and features songs by Matthew Wilder and David Zippel, conducted by Paul Bogaev.

She was born on December 13, 1954. Her notable works include Bone Dance, which was nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula awards, and War for the Oaks, an urban fantasy novel. In addition to writing, Emma is also known for creating a shared universe called Liavek, which she developed with her husband Will Shetterly. Emma has also pursued a career in music, playing guitar, singing, and writing songs for the Minneapolis-based folk/rock bands Cats Laughing and The Flash Girls. Adeline Virginia Woolf (born Stephen) was a famous English writer who lived from 1882 to 1941. She is considered one of the most important modern writers of the 20th century and was a pioneer in using a literary technique called stream of consciousness. She was born into a wealthy family in Kensington, London, and attended King's College London, where she met people who were advocating for women's higher education.Virginia Woolf's first published story, The Mark on the Wall, was initially released in 1917 as part of a collection of short stories titled Two Stories that she co-authored with her husband, Leonard Woolf. Later, in 1921, it was included in another collection called Monday or Tuesday, which was published in New York. Virginia Woolf's novel Orlando: A Biography was first published on October 11, 1928. This lively and imaginative book was inspired by the tumultuous family history of Woolf's close friend and lover, the aristocratic poet and novelist Vita Sackville-West. Many readers consider it one of Woolf's most popular novels, as it offers a satirical and humorous take on English literary history. The book follows the adventures of a poet who changes gender and lives for centuries, encountering many of the key figures of English literature along the way. Due to its themes of gender and identity, Orlando has been widely studied by scholars of women's writing and gender studies. The TV play Me! I'm Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a 1978 production by Alan Bennett, produced by London Weekend Television and directed by Stephen Frears. The title of the play is a humorous take on the title of the classic play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, which itself is a play on words of the Disney song Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?. Dr. Jane de Gay is a well-known British academic and lecturer who specializes in the life and works of Virginia Woolf. She has written extensively on Woolf, including a series of articles and a book titled Virginia Woolf's Novels and the Literary Past, which was published by Edinburgh University Press in 2006. Her work has been recognized by the Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain, a prestigious organization dedicated to the study of Woolf's works. In addition, Dr. de Gay has co-edited four books on gender and theatre with Lizbeth Goodman, including Languages of Theatre Shaped by Women. Freshwater is a two-act chamber opera written by Andy Vores, based on Virginia Woolf's 1929 play. Vores worked with Quentin Bell, Woolf's nephew and the executor of her estate, to create the opera. Bell provided Vores with an earlier version of the play's text that served as the inspiration for parts of the libretto. This rare and previously unseen version of the text helped Vores to develop his opera. Virginia Woolf's short story The Duchess and the Jeweller (1938) is a prime example of her stream-of-consciousness writing style, which explores the inner thoughts and feelings of a greedy jeweller. Through this character, Woolf makes a thematic point that corrupt individuals often act selfishly and without remorse, revealing their true nature. First published in British Harper's Bazaar Magazine in April 1938, and later included in the collection A Haunted House and Other Short Stories (1944), this story showcases Woolf's ability to delve into the complexities of human nature through her unique narrative style. Virginia Woolf's Moments of Being is a collection of autobiographical essays that were first discovered in her husband's papers after her death. Quentin Bell, Virginia's husband's biographer, used these essays in his book about her, which was published in 1972. In 1976, the essays were edited and published again, this time by Jeanne Schulkind. The original texts of the essays are now kept at Sussex University in England and in the British Library in London. Jane Marcus was a trailblazing feminist literary scholar who specialized in women writers of the Modernist era. Her area of expertise included analyzing the social and political context of their works, particularly those of Virginia Woolf, Rebecca West, and Nancy Cunard. Marcus challenged the conventional wisdom of her time by highlighting the feminist, pacifist, and socialist themes in Woolf's writing, which had previously been overlooked by many critics. Her groundbreaking research has become the prevailing understanding in the fields of English literature today, despite the fact that some of her ideas were controversial when they were first proposed and faced opposition from other scholars and critics."}], "output": "  Emma Bull was born earlier than Virginia Woolf. Emma Bull was born on December 13, 1954, while Virginia Woolf was born on January 25, 1882. Therefore, Emma Bull was born approximately 8 years before Virginia Woolf."},

MPN started operations in 1955 and all of its operations are located offshore. The company owns 90 platforms on a territory of approximately 3,200 square kilometers.

PRX-07034 is a special kind of drug that blocks certain receptors in the brain. It has been shown to improve cognitive function and memory in animals, and it also helps reduce food intake and body weight. This drug was being developed by a company called Epix Pharmaceuticals to treat conditions like Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and obesity. However, the company went out of business due to financial problems, and the drug was sold to another company. Exxon was previously known as Standard Oil Company of New Jersey before it merged with Mobil in 1999 to form ExxonMobil. Although ExxonMobil is now a single company, Exxon still exists as a brand for certain gas stations, motor fuel, and related products. In fact, most of these Exxon locations are found in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, and the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. Interestingly, Standard Oil Company of New Jersey was one of the powerful companies, known as the Seven Sisters, that dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. In the late 1800s, a company called the Oregon and Transcontinental Company was formed by Henry Villard to control two railroad and shipping companies in the United States. The company was incorporated in Oregon, but in 1889, the state of New Jersey passed laws that allowed other companies to merge with it and become part of a larger corporation. In 1890, the Oregon and Transcontinental Company reorganized itself as a holding company in New Jersey and changed its name to the North American Company. This allowed it to take advantage of the new corporate powers available in New Jersey and invest in a wider range of businesses. Corporate synergy is when two or more companies combine to create a financial benefit. This happens when they work together in a way that makes their resources and abilities stronger. When companies work together, they can share costs and ideas, which can help them grow and make more money. This is what corporate synergy means.

This Standarte, or regiment, was part of the Allgemeine-SS, which was a branch of the Nazi Party. The Standarte was activated on November 12, 1940, and by the end of the year, it had grown to the size of a full battalion. This was significant because it meant that the command had reached its full strength. The 122nd SS-Standarte was a successor to a previous regiment called the 121st SS-Standarte, also located in Strasbourg, which had been disbanded. Strasbourg is the capital and largest city of the Grand Est region of France, located near the border with Germany in the historic Alsace region. It's also the official seat of the European Parliament. According to the latest estimates, the city proper has around 276,000 inhabitants, while the larger metropolitan area has a population of around 773,000 (not including parts of the city that are located across the border in Germany). In total, the transnational Eurodistrict Strasbourg-Ortenau has a population of around 915,000 inhabitants.The 122nd Hydroplane Liaison Squadron (also known as the 122nd Hydroplane Section) was formed on July 24, 1949, as part of the Yugoslav Air Force and Navy. The squadron was created as a fusion of two separate entities: the 122nd Hydroplane Section of the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force's 122nd Aviation Squadron. This merger aimed to strengthen the communication and transportation capabilities of the Yugoslav military by combining the expertise of both branches. The 122nd Fighter Aviation Squadron was a fighter squadron in the Yugoslav Air Force, established in April 1961 as part of the 94th Fighter Aviation Regiment at Skopski Petrovac military airport. In military language, these terms are used to identify a specific unit or division within a country's armed forces. The number 122 is used to distinguish one division from another, much like how a person's name is used to identify them individually. For example, if someone is a member of the 122nd Division, they are part of a particular group of soldiers within their country's military. The 122nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry, also known as the 122nd OVI, was an infantry regiment in the Union Army during the American Civil War. The 122nd Infantry Regiment is part of the United States Army and is based in Georgia. It was formed all the way back in 1857 and is still around today as the 122nd Regiment - Regional Training Institute. The 122nd Fighter Squadron (122nd FS) is part of the Louisiana Air National Guard's 159th Fighter Wing, which is based at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans in Louisiana. The 122nd FS is equipped with the advanced F-15C/D Eagle fighter jets. During World War I, the 122nd Battalion, CEF was a unit in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Based in Huntsville, Ontario, the unit began recruiting in November 1915 in the Muskoka region. In June 1917, the battalion sailed to England, and on June 9, 1917, it was absorbed into the Canadian Forestry Depot. The 122nd Battalion, CEF had only one officer in command, Lieutenant-Colonel D.M. Grant. The 122nd Division of the Imperial Japanese Army, also known as the Maizuru Division (第122師団、舞鶴兵団), was formed on January 16, 1940, in Mudanjiang. It was one of eight divisions created at the same time, along with the 121st, 122nd, 123rd, 124th, 125th, 126th, 127th, and 128th Divisions.

In the Netherlands, there's a fun phenomenon called Oranjegekte or Oranjekoorts that happens during big sports events, like international football championships, and on a special holiday called Koningsdag (King's Day). People get really into it by wearing orange clothing like T-shirts, caps, and scarves. The media pays a lot of attention to sports and sports fans, and people decorate their homes, cars, and even whole streets with orange stuff, which is the traditional color of the royal family, the House of Orange-Nassau.Queen's Day, also known as Koninginnedag, was a national holiday in the Netherlands, the Netherlands Antilles, and Aruba from 1890 to 2013.

This holiday was created by a Belizean civil rights leader named Thomas Vincent Ramos in 1941. In the early 1940s, the British army forced the Garifuna people to leave their homes in the Grenadines and move to Belize. To celebrate their new home, the Garifuna people asked the government to make November 19 a public holiday. This request was granted in 1977, and since then, the holiday has been celebrated with parades, music, and traditional dances in the town of Dangriga. In Saint Lucia, a special day called Jounen Kwéyòl (Creole Day) is celebrated on the last Sunday of October. This event has been happening every year since 1984. On this day, different towns on the island host the festival and show off their preparations. They serve local dishes and drinks, such as roasted breadfruit, Green Fig and Salt Fish (Saint Lucia's national dish), plantain, king fish, Manicou (opossum), Souse (a soup made with pork and cucumber), fried bake and floats, Accra (a fried dough containing salt fish), Paime (also known as Conkies), and Bouillon (a stew made with fish, chicken, or meat, yams, plantains, bananas, and dumplings). The locals also enjoy drinks like Cocoa Tea, Golden Apple Juice, Guava Juice, and more.\n\nApart from the food, the event features traditional Creole music, including drums and singing in the Creole language. People celebrate by wearing the island's national wear, such as the Wob Dwiete, or by making clothing out of special plaid material called Madras, which is one of the cloths used in the national wear. Many places in Saint Lucia celebrate Jounen Kwéyòl every year, including Mon Repos and Dennery. The Eighth was a federal holiday in the United States from 1828 to 1861, honoring the Battle of New Orleans that took place on January 8, 1815. During this battle, Tennessee's Andrew Jackson led a successful fight against both British soldiers and freed slaves. The holiday became widely popular in the southern United States after the final battle of the War of 1812. In 1828, following Jackson's election as President, the Eighth was officially declared an national holiday. The holiday continued to be observed until the start of the American Civil War in 1861. Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, also known as the National Holiday in Quebec, is a special day celebrated on June 24. This is because June 24 is the day when Saint John the Baptist was born.

In the Basque Country, Christmas celebrations begin on December 21st with the feast of Santo Tomas. On this day, people dress up in traditional clothing and dance in the streets while enjoying a local delicacy called talo with txistorra (a type of spicy Basque sausage). The traditional outfit for both men and women includes a long skirt or dress for women, and a long-sleeved shirt and beret for men. The women's outfits are typically dark blue, but can come in various colors. The reason for wearing these traditional outfits is that they represent the clothing worn by the peasants who used to come to town on Santo Tomas to pay their rent to landlords."}], "output": "  People in the Netherlands wear orange clothing during Oranjegekte or to celebrate King's Day (Koningsdag) on April 27th or 26th, depending on the day of the week.

It's a comedy version of William Shakespeare's play Romeo & Juliet, but it has a twist - it's not a faithful adaptation. The movie was directed by Lloyd Kaufman and written by Kaufman and James Gunn, who also helped with the production. James Gunn is an American creative talent who has made a name for himself in various fields of entertainment. Born on August 5, he started his career as a screenwriter in the mid-1990s, penning scripts for movies like Tromeo and Juliet (1996), Scooby-Doo (2002), and its sequel (2004), as well as the 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead. Gunn then began working as a director, starting with the film Slither (2006). He has also created and directed the web series James Gunn's PG Porn, and has written and directed several superhero movies, including Super (2010), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014), and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017).William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet has been adapted for the screen countless times, and some of the most notable film versions include George Cukor's 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired adaptation. Cukor's version featured mature actors Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard as the young lovers, while Zeffirelli's film featured beautiful young actors. Baz Luhrmann's version, on the other hand, was a fast-paced and heavily cut version aimed at a younger audience. In William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, Romeo Montague is the main character. He's the son of Montague and his wife, and he has a secret love for Juliet, who is a member of the rival Capulet family. Unfortunately, Romeo and Juliet get into trouble when he kills her cousin Tybalt in a duel, which forces Romeo to leave town. To make matters worse, Romeo believes Juliet is dead, so he takes his own life in despair. Baz Luhrmann directed, co-produced, and co-wrote the 1996 movie Romeo + Juliet, which is an adaptation and modernization of William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes star as Romeo and Juliet, who fall in love at a party despite being from feuding families, the Montagues and Capulets. The movie also features Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, and Diane Venora in supporting roles. William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet features a famous line where Juliet says, What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. This phrase is often used to suggest that the names of things don't matter, but it's actually a paraphrase of Shakespeare's original words. In the scene known as the balcony scene, Juliet compares Romeo to a rose, saying that if he wasn't named Romeo, he would still be handsome and her love. She also implies that if he wasn't a Montague, her family's rival, she could marry him without any problems.

She is best known for her work in television, starting in the early 1980s. Bobbi Bacha is a private investigator from Texas who was featured in a 2004 TV movie called Suburban Madness produced by Sony Pictures. Actress Sela Ward played the role of Bobbi Bacha in the movie. Interestingly, Bobbi Bacha was also involved in a high-profile case involving New York millionaire Robert Durst, who was accused of murdering his neighbor Morris Black in Galveston, Texas. Despite being charged with murder, Durst was acquitted by a jury in Galveston County.Barend (or sometimes spelled Barent) is a common Dutch male given name and middle name. According to data from 2014, there are over 4,000 men in the Netherlands with this name as their first name, and nearly 3,000 with it as their middle name. The name is believed to have originated from the name Bernard. Some notable people with this name include... Marion Christopher Barry was born in June 1980 to Marion Barry and his third wife, Effi Slaughter Barry. He was their only child. His father had wanted to name him Marion Barry III, but Effi disagreed and they decided to give him the middle name Christopher instead. Throughout most of his adult life, Barry went by his middle name, Christopher. Suburban Madness is a true crime drama TV movie based on a real story, starring Sela Ward as Private Investigator Bobbi Bacha of Blue Moon Investigations. It aired on CBS on October 3, 2004. In Latvia, like in many European cultures, names are made up of two parts: the given name (also called the first name or vārds) and the family name (uzvārds). During the Soviet occupation of Latvia from 1940 to 1991, the practice of giving a middle name was discouraged. However, after Latvia regained its independence, the country's laws once again allow for the use of up to two given names, and it has become more common to give a middle name to children.   Singh is a name that originated in India, specifically from the Sanskrit word for lion. It was originally used as a title by certain warrior castes in India, and later adopted by Guru Gobind Singh as a mandatory name for all Sikhs. Over time, the name Singh has been adopted by various castes and communities throughout the Indian subcontinent and among the Indian diaspora, becoming more of a title than a surname, and is now found across different religious groups and communities. Jeff Strabone is a well-known academic and community leader in Brooklyn. In 2016, he gained national attention when he published the names and addresses of Electoral College members on his website, urging people to write to them and ask them not to vote for Donald Trump. Strabone has been actively involved in various civic issues in Brooklyn, including preserving historic theaters, improving building codes and housing, and promoting better traffic flow. He has also been a leader in the Cobble Hill Association, a neighborhood preservation group. In addition, Strabone is the co-founder and chairman of the New Brooklyn Theatre.

He plays various instruments such as guitar, pedal steel, piano, violin, dobro, hurdy-gurdy, mandolin, saxophone, and theremin, among others. According to Colin Meloy, who said this at the Pilgrimage Festival in Franklin, Tennessee on September 27, 2015, Funk was originally given the middle name Ryman, but a clerical error on his birth certificate resulted in it being recorded as Lyman instead.   In many cultures, people have multiple names that are used to identify them. In some cultures, a given name comes before the surname, and this additional name is called a middle name. In English-speaking American culture, the term middle name is sometimes used to refer to any additional name after a person's given name and before their surname, even if the person prefers to use a different term to describe their name. This can lead to confusion, as some people may consider their middle name to be something else entirely, such as a nickname or a family name."}], "output": "  The middle name of the actress who plays Bobbi Bacha in Suburban Madness is Christopher.**"},

Mexia was based in St. Augustine and had a special job to do with the native people who lived nearby. He was sent to make friends with the Ais tribe, who lived south of St. Augustine and in the Cape Canaveral area. This mission was successful, and it led to a period of peaceful relations between the Spanish and the Ais people. For over 12,000 years, Indigenous people lived in what is now Florida. However, by the early 18th century, most of these original Floridians had died out. Some Apalachees moved to Louisiana, where their descendants live today, while others were taken to Cuba and Mexico by the Spanish in the 18th century. A small number may have also blended in with the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes.The Australian High Commission in London is the official diplomatic representation of Australia in the UK. It is located in a historic building called Australia House, which is a Grade II listed monument. This mission is significant because it is both Australia's first diplomatic mission and the longest continuously occupied diplomatic mission in the UK, meaning it has been serving as the country's representative in the UK for a long time. A diplomatic mission is a group of people from one country or organization sent to another country to represent their home country or organization officially. In simple terms, a diplomatic mission can be thought of as an ambassador's office in a foreign country. The resident mission, which is usually called an embassy, is located in the capital city of the receiving country and serves as the main office for the diplomatic representatives of the sending country. Consulates, on the other hand, are smaller diplomatic missions that are not located in the capital of the receiving country. These missions can also represent their home country in one or more other countries, making them both resident and non-resident embassies. A diplomatic bag, also known as a diplomatic pouch, is a special container that carries important documents or other items between a diplomatic mission and its home government or other official entities. The bag has special legal protections that prevent unauthorized people from opening or tampering with its contents. The bag can be any size or shape, like a cardboard box, briefcase, duffel bag, large suitcase, or even a shipping container. It usually has a lock or seal to show that it's been used by a diplomatic mission. As long as it's marked with a special sign, the bag is protected from being searched or seized by law enforcement, even if it's being carried by a courier who is traveling between countries. The bag can only contain items that are meant for official use.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. The Embassy of China in London is the official diplomatic representation of China in the United Kingdom. It is the only Chinese embassy in the UK, along with two Consulates-General in Edinburgh and Manchester. The London mission has been China's permanent overseas diplomatic mission since 1877, when it was established as the Chinese Legation. This makes it the oldest and most important diplomatic mission in the UK for China. The mission has served as the diplomatic representative of the Qing Empire, the Republic of China, and since 1950, the People's Republic of China. One notable event that took place at the embassy was the detention of Sun Yat-sen, a key figure in the Chinese revolution of 1911. Today, the embassy remains the central location for events related to China in the UK, including celebrations held in 2012 to mark 40 years of diplomatic relations between the UK and the People's Republic of China. The United States Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya (also known as the Embassy of the United States to Kenya or Embassy Nairobi to the State Department) is the diplomatic mission of the United States to Kenya. The embassy has been located in central Nairobi since 1964, when the United States established diplomatic relations with Kenya. Unfortunately, the original embassy was the target of a terrorist attack in 1998, and a new embassy building was constructed in the Gigiri suburb of Nairobi in 2003. Interestingly, the US diplomatic mission to Somalia is also based at the Nairobi embassy. Azerbaijan established its Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1918, when it became an independent republic for the first time. This was followed by diplomatic relations with other countries, including the Ottoman State and Iran. The country's diplomatic delegation attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. After Azerbaijan regained its independence in 1991, it began to establish bilateral relations with other countries and opened diplomatic missions in over 70 countries. Recently, Azerbaijan has also opened embassies and consulates in countries such as Brazil, Australia, and Vietnam.   In diplomatic terms, the head of mission (HOM or COM) is the leader of a diplomatic representation, such as an ambassador, high commissioner, nuncio, chargé d'affaires, permanent representative, or consul-general. This title can also refer to the heads of certain international organizations' representative offices. Other titles or uses that qualify as a head of mission or equivalent may also exist. It is common for the second in command of a diplomatic mission to be referred to as the deputy head of mission or deputy chief of mission (DCM). The United States has a diplomatic mission in Brussels, Belgium called the United States Mission to the European Union (USEU). This mission represents the United States' relationship with the European Union, which has been in place since 1953. The US has had diplomatic relations with the EU's predecessors over the years, starting with a diplomatic mission to the European Coal and Steel Community in Luxembourg that opened in 1956. In 1961, the mission moved to Brussels and became the US Mission to the European Communities. When the European Union was established in 1993, the mission was renamed the United States Mission to the European Union."}], "output": "  Alvaro Mexia had a diplomatic mission with the Ais tribe.**"},

Additionally, he is a member of the prestigious Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. Social Anthropology/Anthropologie Sociale is a quarterly academic journal that has been published since 2007 by Wiley-Blackwell on behalf of the European Association of Social Anthropologists. The journal was initially established in 1992 and was previously published by Cambridge University Press. The current editors-in-chief of the journal are Sarah Green and Patrick Laviolette. Importantly, articles in the journal are published in either English or French. The book Network Analysis and Ethnographic Problems: Process Models of a Turkish Nomad Clan is a groundbreaking anthropological and complexity science study by social anthropologists Douglas R. White of the University of California, Irvine, and Ulla Johansen of the University of Cologne. It is widely regarded as a significant contribution to the field of anthropology and political science in Central Asia. Aleksandar Bošković is a social anthropologist from the former Yugoslavia who has published numerous books and articles on the history and theory of anthropology. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Ethnology and Anthropology at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy and a Professor of Anthropology at the University of Donja Gorica in Montenegro. From February 2017, Bošković also leads the Department of Anthropological Research at the Institute of Social Sciences in Belgrade, where he is the Director of Research. Previously, he taught at several universities worldwide, including the University of St Andrews, Belgrade University, Brasília University, University of the Witwatersrand, and Rhodes University. Between 2000 and 2014, he was a faculty member in the Post-graduate Program in Anthropology at the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia. Recently, Bošković was selected as the EASA Book Series Editor and is co-convenor of the History of Anthropology Network of the European Association of Social Anthropologists, together with Han Vermeulen.   Participant observation is a common data collection method used in qualitative research. It's widely used in fields like cultural anthropology and ethnology, but less so in sociology, communication studies, human geography, and social psychology. The goal of participant observation is to get a close and personal understanding of a specific group of people, such as a religious, occupational, or subcultural group, by immersing oneself in their daily lives over an extended period of time. This method originated in the fieldwork of social anthropologists, including Bronisław Malinowski and his students in Britain and the students of Franz Boas in the United States, as well as in urban research conducted by the Chicago School of sociology. Muted group theory (MGT) was developed by social anthropologists Edwin and Shirley Ardener in 1975. This theory explains how a dominant group controls a language system and how this can affect the way members of a subordinate group express themselves. When people from a subordinate group use the language created by the dominant group, they may struggle to communicate their ideas clearly because they don't fully understand the language or because the dominant group doesn't listen to their perspective. This can lead to the subordinate group being ignored or silenced. MGT was first used to study the differences between men and women, but it can also be applied to any group that is marginalized or silenced due to language barriers. The Association of Social Anthropologists of the UK and Commonwealth is a professional organization in the UK that promotes the study of psychosocial issues. It is part of the Academy of Social Sciences, a prestigious group of academics in the UK. The association is dedicated to advancing the field of social anthropology, which examines the relationship between humans and society. By joining this organization, anthropologists can connect with other experts in the field, share their research, and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in the field. Coral Gardens and Their Magic is the final book in anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski's series of studies on the lives of the Trobriand Islanders. This book focuses on the ways the islanders grew food, specifically yams, taro, bananas, and palms, and how they viewed their gardens as more than just practical spaces. Malinowski believed that the gardens were works of art that held spiritual significance for the islanders. In 1988, Alfred Gell called Coral Gardens and Their Magic the best account of a primitive technological-cum-magical system, and it is still considered a groundbreaking work in the field. Many consider this book to be Malinowski's most important work."}], "output": "  The passage mentions the following nationalities of social anthropologists:\n\n* British (Edmund Leach, Alfred Gell, Thomas Hylland Eriksen)\n* Norwegian (Thomas Hylland Eriksen)\n* Yugoslavian (Aleksandar Bošković)\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nBritish, Norwegian, Yugoslavian."},

But some leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, opposed the move, thinking that Gardnerville was trying to take over the county seat. Despite these protests, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners before it was fully completed, as the Genoa jail burned down and one prisoner was left chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once the jail was finished, it served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail.

In the 1960s, he performed and recorded as Bob Seger and the Last Heard and Bob Seger System in the Detroit area. By the early 1970s, he dropped the 'System' from his recordings and continued to strive for success with different bands. In 1973, he formed the Silver Bullet Band with a group of Detroit musicians, and they became successful on a national level with the live album Live Bullet (1976), recorded at Cobo Hall in Detroit. Seger also worked extensively with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, a group of Alabama musicians who appeared on several of his hit singles and albums. In 1976, he achieved a breakout success with the studio album Night Moves. Bob Seger's eleventh album, Against the Wind, was released in February 1980 and marked his fourth album with the Silver Bullet Band. This album was a major success, reaching the top of the Billboard Top LPs chart for six weeks, knocking Pink Floyd's The Wall from the number one spot.

Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional? \n\n Passage:   In the Rostker v. Goldberg case, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 1981 that the practice of only requiring men to register for the draft was constitutional. After much debate and discussion in Congress, the law was passed to apply only to men. Later, some lawyers, including Robert L. Goldberg, challenged the law, arguing that it was unfair to only require men to register. In a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was not a violation of the equal protection clause of the due process clause and allowed the law to stand as is. (The named defendant in the case is Bernard D. Rostker, the Director of the Selective Service System.) In the United States, conscription, also known as the draft, has been used by the federal government in four major conflicts: the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars). The draft was created in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act, which was the first peacetime draft in the country's history. From 1940 to 1973, men were drafted into the military to fill vacancies that couldn't be filled through voluntary means, both during peacetime and times of conflict. The draft was discontinued when the military transitioned to an all-volunteer force. However, all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are still required to register with the Selective Service System, which remains in place as a contingency plan in case a draft is needed again in the future.On May 9, 2010, a special parade was held in Kiev to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in World War II. The parade was attended by important military officials, including the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces, General Ivan Svyda, who inspected the parade. The commander of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Colonel General Gennady Vorobyov, led the parade, while President Viktor Yanukovych gave a special speech. A total of 2,500 troops from Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus took part in the parade, along with 17 military orchestras led by the Chief of the Military Music Department of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Major General Volodymyr Derkach. The Indian armed forces and veterans have been demanding the One Rank One Pension (OROP) principle for years, which means that all personnel of the same rank and with the same length of service would receive the same pension, regardless of when they retired. This demand stems from a broader issue of pay-pension equity, which was sparked by a controversial decision made by the Indira Gandhi-led Indian National Congress (INC) government in 1973. Two years after India's historic victory in the 1971 Bangladesh war, the government unexpectedly reduced pensions for armed forces personnel by 20-40%, while increasing civilian pensions by 20%. This decision was made without consulting the armed forces headquarters, which upset many veterans and led to the OROP movement. The person in charge of the Canadian Armed Forces is called the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). They are the second most important person in the Armed Forces, after the commander-in-chief. The CDS leads the Armed Forces Council and is responsible for the overall command, control, and administration of the forces, as well as military strategy, plans, and requirements. The CDS is a senior member of one of the three main branches of the Armed Forces, and the current person holding this position is Jonathan Vance, who has been in the role since July 17, 2015. The annual military parade held in Mexico City on September 16th to celebrate the country's independence is a long-standing tradition that dates back to the late 19th century. This parade, which is the largest of several held across the country on Independence Day, is presided over by the President of Mexico in his role as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The event is attended by various high-ranking officials, including members of the Cabinet, Congress, and the diplomatic corps, as well as uniformed service members, veterans, and representatives from various sectors of society, including the religious, indigenous, sports, and private sectors. The parade is broadcast on TV and the internet, and can also be heard on the radio, making it one of the biggest events of the year. Members of the Mexican Armed Forces and Federal Police participate in the parade. Fernando Tapias Stahelin was born on July 14, 1943, and passed away on September 27, 2015. He was a retired General of the Colombian Armed Forces. During his time in the military, he served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff for four years (1998-2002) under President Andres Pastrana. After that, he was the ambassador of Colombia in the Dominican Republic from 2002 to 2004, and then served as Deputy Minister of Defense for a social and business group for two years (2009-2010) under President Alvaro Uribe. Tapias Stahelin spent 41 years in the Colombian Armed Forces, advancing through all the military ranks and eventually becoming General Commander. The Military Covenant, also known as the Armed Forces Covenant, is a term used in the UK since 2000 to describe the mutual obligations between the country and its military forces. It's not a legally binding agreement, but it's still taken very seriously within the military. The term was coined in 2000 and has since become a way for politicians and society as a whole to measure whether they are fulfilling their obligations to support members of the armed forces. In Poland, Armed Forces Day (also known as the Feast of the Polish Armed Forces) is celebrated annually on August 15. This national holiday commemorates the victory of Poland over Soviet Russia in the Battle of Warsaw during the Polish-Soviet War in 1920. The day is celebrated alongside the Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, another public holiday. To mark the occasion, the Polish Armed Forces hold military parades, equipment displays, and rememberance events across the country. The largest event takes place in Warsaw, where a grand military parade winds its way through the city center. This holiday was first celebrated during the Second Republic, but was banned by communist authorities in 1947. It was reinstated in 1992 after Poland's transition to democracy.   In June 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC). This was a significant federal move to support the rights of African Americans between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The order stated that the federal government would not hire anyone based on their race, color, religion, or national origin. The FEPC made sure that federal agencies and companies receiving government contracts did not discriminate during the hiring process. As a result, millions of African Americans and women gained better jobs and higher pay.\n\nDuring World War II, the race issue became more prominent as the Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War. However, by 1940, many African Americans had switched from voting Republican to Democrat, and leaders like Walter Francis White of the NAACP and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League were part of Roosevelt's coalition. In June 1941, A. Philip Randolph, a prominent African-American trade unionist, urged Roosevelt to establish the FEPC, which he agreed to do. However, the military services, particularly the Marine Corps, found ways to circumvent the order, and it was left to Roosevelt's successor, Harry S. Truman, to fully desegregate the armed forces."}], "output": "  The Supreme Court case Rostker v. Goldberg was about the constitutionality of requiring only men to register for the draft, not women.

This happened between 1995 and 1996, and the truth came out in 1998. During a televised speech, Clinton said he didn't have a sexual relationship with Lewinsky, but further investigation showed that he did. This led to charges of lying and impeachment against Clinton by the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998. He was later acquitted of these charges in a 21-day trial in the Senate. Clinton was also punished by a judge in a separate case for giving false testimony in another scandal, and he lost his license to practice law in Arkansas for five years.\n\nI hope this helps!

Parscale was responsible for the Donald J. Trump for President website and digital media strategy throughout the Republican primary, and in June 2016, he was officially named digital media director for the campaign. After the election, Parscale and another senior Trump aide, Nick Ayers, launched a non-profit organization called America First Policies to promote President Trump's agenda and White House initiatives. Donald Trump is mentioned in music through songs, albums, and bands that reference him and his brands, including Trump Tower, his TV show, hotel chain, and casinos.

Since Donald Trump entered the 2016 presidential race, protests against him have been held both in the United States and around the world. These protests have expressed opposition to Trump's campaign speeches, his election victory, his inauguration, and various actions he's taken as president.

Although Trump had never held elected office, he was well-known for his frequent comments on public affairs and business successes as head of The Trump Organization. He had previously considered running for president in 1988 as a Republican, but decided not to. In 2000, Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura convinced Trump to run for the presidential nomination of the Reform Party, which was struggling despite achieving ballot access and qualifying for matching funds due to the 1996 presidential campaign of businessman Ross Perot. Trump's entry into the Reform Party race coincided with that of paleoconservative commentator Pat Buchanan, whom Trump publicly criticized as a Hitler-lover throughout the campaign.

He was known as an amora, which means he was a teacher of Jewish law and tradition. Anani rarely talked about Halakot, which are the laws of Judaism, and when he did, he didn't come up with new ideas. Instead, he would repeat what other scholars had said. However, when it came to the Haggadah, which is a collection of stories and teachings about Jewish tradition, Anani was more original. He believed that the priestly garments in the Temple had atoning powers, and he used this idea to explain why certain rituals were performed in a particular way. For example, he said that the miter on a priest's head atoned for haughtiness, and that the other priestly garments had similar atoning powers. Anani also used the story of God appearing to Moses in the thorn-bush to explain how God's glory can fill the universe. He believed that God's glory can be seen in many different ways, and that when God wants to, He can make it seem like three angels are sitting under one tree. Overall, Anani's teachings show that he was a thoughtful and creative scholar who was able to find new ways to interpret and understand Jewish tradition. Lev Kuleshov was a renowned Russian and Soviet filmmaker and film theorist who played a key role in establishing the world's first film school, the Moscow Film School.

They are based in the town of El Nacimiento in Múzquiz Municipality and are the descendants of Black Seminoles who escaped slavery in the United States and settled in Mexico. The Black Seminoles were a group of black people who were associated with the Seminole people in Florida and Oklahoma. They were the descendants of free blacks and escaped slaves, called maroons, who formed alliances with the Seminole groups in Spanish Florida. The Black Seminoles lived near the Seminole people in small groups, and some were even held as slaves by Seminole leaders. However, they had more freedom than enslaved black people held by white people in the South or by other Native American tribes, including the right to own weapons.  Dhoolpet is a historic neighborhood in Hyderabad, India, located within the old city. Many people from Uttar Pradesh migrated to this area during the Nizam rule, and the Nizam himself helped them settle here. However, Dhoolpet has a reputation for illegal activities such as bootlegging, and there have been instances of violence against police officers and excise department officials during raids. The Seminole people have their own unique music, which is called Seminole music. They are an indigenous group from the Americas who formed in Florida in the 18th century. Today, most Seminoles live in Oklahoma, but some still live in Florida. There are three groups that are recognized by the federal government, and some people belong to other smaller groups. Their traditional music includes instruments like rattles, hand drums, water drums, and flutes. The Seminole are a Native American tribe originally from Florida. Today, most of them live in Oklahoma, with a smaller number still living in Florida. There are three federally recognized tribes of Seminole: the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, as well as some independent groups. The Seminole people developed their own identity over time through a process called ethnogenesis, which means they formed their own distinct culture and community from other Native American groups who settled in Florida in the 18th century. The word Seminole comes from a Creek word that means wild one or runaway, which may have been influenced by the Spanish word cimarrón. The history of draining and developing the Everglades began in the 19th century. During the Second Seminole War (1836), the US military sought out Seminole people in the Everglades to capture or kill them. This led to the creation of maps that showed the complex and challenging terrain of the area. As the US expanded and progressed in the latter half of the 19th century, there was a growing interest in draining the Everglades for agricultural use. Historians believe that during this time, there was a national push to remove wetlands without question, and it was considered the right thing to do. The Muscogee language, also known as Creek, Seminole, Maskókî, or Muskogee, is spoken by the Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole people, primarily in the US states of Oklahoma and Florida. This language is part of the Muskogean language family and is spoken by these indigenous communities. Seminole County is located in the state of Oklahoma, USA. According to the 2010 census, the population of the county was 25,482 people. The town of Wewoka is the main settlement and administrative center of the county. Interestingly, before Oklahoma became a state, Seminole County was the only area of Indian Territory reserved for the Seminole people, who were relocated from Florida in the 1820s. On January 15, 1838, a battle called the Battle of Jupiter Inlet took place between the Seminole Indians (also known as Seminole Negro) and the United States Navy. This was the first of several battles led by the US Navy in the area, also known as the First Battle of Loxahatchee. The battle began when Lieutenant Levin Powell led a group of 200 soldiers, sailors, and marines along the east coast of Florida. They spotted a trail near Jupiter Inlet and sent 75 men to find the Seminole camp nearby. The camp was led by Sam Jones, a spiritual medicine and war chief of the Miccosukee and Seminole people during the war. When the US officers advanced on the camp, they were outnumbered and ambushed. After a long and fierce fight, the US military retreated, with five men killed in action and about twenty others wounded. Lieutenant Powell was one of those killed in the battle. The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma is a Native American tribe recognized by the federal government in the United States. It is the largest of the three tribes that are recognized as Seminole, with the other two being the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma has its roots in the 3,000 Seminoles who were forced to leave Florida after the Second Seminole War and were relocated to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) with 800 Black Seminoles. The tribe is headquartered in Wewoka, Oklahoma, within Seminole County. Today, there are approximately 18,800 enrolled tribal members, with 13,533 living within the state of Oklahoma. The tribe began to rebuild its government in 1936 under the Indian Reorganization Act, and its reservation was originally larger but now covers Seminole County, Oklahoma, where it has various properties."}], "output": "  The descendants of the group of black Indians associated with the Seminole people settled in Oklahoma."},

She is also a philanthropist herself, and her charitable work has primarily focused on the Sherwood Foundation, a non-profit organization in Omaha that provides grants for public education, human services, and social justice. The foundation aims to improve the lives of children from low-income families. In addition to her work with the Sherwood Foundation, Susan is also involved with the Buffett Foundation and Girls, Inc., two other organizations dedicated to supporting children and families. According to her brother Howard Graham Buffett, Susan's philanthropic efforts have always been focused on helping children, education, and family issues, but she has also shown support for other causes such as reducing debt, addressing AIDS, and improving conditions in Africa through her work with the non-profit organization Debt, AIDS, Trade, Africa. The book The Warren Buffett Way by Robert Hagstrom explains the investment principles of Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors in history. Buffett's approach to investing is based on the concept of value investing, which involves looking for companies that are undervalued by the market and holding onto them for the long term. By following these principles, Buffett has built a remarkable track record of success in his investment career."}], "output": "  Howard Buffett, Warren Buffett's son, and Susan Buffett, Warren Buffett's wife, are both involved in philanthropy.

He was the second-best Indian fast bowler in Test cricket, next to Kapil Dev. In 2000, the ICC KnockOut Trophy was a One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament held in Kenya, which helped to grow the popularity of cricket in the country. New Zealand won the tournament and received a prize of US$250,000. This was their first major ODI victory. The tournament also saw the debuts of three talented cricketers: Zaheer Khan, Yuvraj Singh, and Marlon Samuels.In 1998, a cricket tournament called the ICC KnockOut Trophy (also known as the Wills International Cup or Mini World Cup) was held in Bangladesh. This was special because it was the first time that all Test-playing countries participated in a tournament other than the World Cups. The teams that won the knockout stages, which were India, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and the West Indies, made it to the semi-finals. In the first semi-final, South Africa defeated Sri Lanka by 92 runs after the match was reduced to 39 overs per innings due to rain. In the second semi-final, the West Indies beat India by six wickets and advanced to the final. In 2000, eleven cricket teams from different countries (all Test nations and two One Day International nations) participated in the second edition of the ICC KnockOut Trophy. The tournament took place in Kenya from October 3 to 15. In the preliminary quarterfinals, teams from Kenya and Zimbabwe played against India and Sri Lanka, respectively, and India and Sri Lanka won their matches comfortably. In the third preliminary quarterfinal, England defeated Bangladesh to secure their spot in the tournament. Finally, New Zealand won the trophy by defeating India in the final match by four wickets, which was their first International Cricket Council (ICC) event victory. Lindum Sports Club Ground is a cricket ground located in Lincoln, Lincolnshire. Since 1861, when Lincolnshire played an All-England Eleven at the ground, the venue has hosted many cricket matches. In 1907, Lincolnshire played their first Minor Counties Championship match at the ground against Staffordshire. The ground was used by Lincolnshire during different periods in the 21st century, including their final Minor Counties Championship match in 2000 against Cumberland. In 1996, the ground hosted its first MCCA Knockout Trophy match, which saw Lincolnshire play Bedfordshire. From 1996 to 2007, the ground held four MCCA Knockout Trophy matches, including the final match played on the ground to date between Lincolnshire and Staffordshire.   Guy Philip Randall-Johnson, born on December 8, 1959, is a former English cricketer and umpire from Crediton, Devon. He started playing Minor counties cricket for Devon between 1987 and 1991, before moving on to umpiring in 1993. In his early years as an umpire, he stood in matches between Minor counties and Welsh teams, as well as in the MCCA Knockout Trophy. He made his List A umpiring debut in 1999 in a NatWest Trophy match between Somerset and Bedfordshire. Over the next six years, he stood in seven List A matches, the last of which was in 2004. Randall-Johnson continued to umpire in Minor counties cricket until 2008, having stood in 54 Championship matches and 25 Knockout Trophy matches. In 2006, he made headlines when he walked out of a Minor Counties Championship match after being subjected to abuse from Berkshire players after he gave their captain, Julian Wood, out LBW. When he didn't receive an apology, he left the game, with others deputizing for him. In 1998, nine cricket teams from different countries (known as Test nations) participated in the first Champions Trophy tournament. The tournament was held in Bangladesh from October 24 to November 2 of that year. Each team could choose a preliminary team of 30 players, but only 14 players were allowed on the final roster, which was due a month before the tournament started. During the knockout stage of the competition, only New Zealand and Zimbabwe played a pre-quarterfinal match. New Zealand won and advanced to the quarterfinals, where they faced Sri Lanka. Finally, South Africa won the inaugural ICC KnockOut Trophy by defeating West Indies in the final by four wickets. Davies made his second XI debut for Glamorgan against MCC young cricketers and has since played over 25 matches for the county. He later made his Test match debut for Wales Minor Counties against Lincolnshire in the 2009 MCCA Knockout Trophy. His Minor Counties Championship debut came in the same year against Shropshire.

It belongs to a center called the Ogden Air Logistics Center (OO-ALC), which is under the Air Force Materiel Command. The squadron is stationed at Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Hill Air Force Base (IATA: HIF, ICAO: KHIF, FAA LID: HIF) is a significant US Air Force base located in northern Utah, near the cities of Ogden, Clearfield, Riverdale, Roy, Sunset, and Layton. It's about 30 miles north of Salt Lake City. The base was named after Major Ployer Peter Hill of the US Army Air Corps, who died during a test flight of a B-17 Flying Fortress bomber. Today, Hill AFB remains one of the largest employers in Utah, ranking sixth in the state and third excluding government and higher education jobs.The 413th Flight Test Squadron is part of the 96th Test Wing and is located at Duke Field, which is part of Eglin Air Force Base in Florida. The squadron conducts flight testing on various military aircraft, including the C-130 Hercules, CV-22 Osprey, MH-53 Pave Low, UH-1 Iroquois, and HH-60 Pave Hawk. In other words, the 413th Flight Test Squadron is responsible for testing these different types of aircraft to ensure they are safe and functioning properly.   The 486th Flight Test Squadron is a secretive unit based at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, with a misleading name that doesn't fully reveal its true purpose. Despite its designation, the squadron is actually associated with the United States Department of State's Foreign Emergency Support Team and is involved in special operations and intelligence missions around the world. The squadron's motto, Not always what they seem, reflects the secrecy surrounding its activities. Although the squadron has been assigned to different units over time, including the 227th Special Operations Flight and the 150th Special Operations Squadron, it is currently part of the 46th Test Wing at Eglin and operates two aircraft, a Boeing C-32B or a Boeing 757-23A, on standby alert for special missions. Official documents confirm that the squadron's operations fall under the command of Air Force Special Operations Command. The 415th Flight Test Flight is a US Air Force reserve squadron. It belongs to the 413th Flight Test Group, which is part of the Air Force Reserve Command. The squadron is stationed at Randolph Field, which is located within Joint Base San Antonio in Texas. The 10th Flight Test Squadron, which is part of the 413th Flight Test Group based at Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma, performs an important job. They test refurbished military planes, like the Rockwell B-1 Lancer, Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, Boeing E-3 Sentry, and Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, before they are returned to their units. This involves conducting thorough tests to ensure that the planes are safe and ready for use. The 419th Flight Test Squadron is part of the US Air Force. It belongs to a group called the 412th Operations Group, which is under the Air Force Materiel Command. The squadron is based at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The 370th Flight Test Squadron is part of the United States Air Force and is based at Edwards Air Force Base in California. It is part of the 413th Flight Test Group. The 417th Flight Test Squadron is no longer active in the United States Air Force. Its last assignment was to the 412th Operations Group at Edwards Air Force Base in California, where it was inactivated on February 14, 2012. The squadron was first activated in 1989 as the 6517th Test Squadron and tested the McDonnell Douglas C-17 Globemaster III. It was later inactivated in 1995 and then reactivated in 2006 to conduct ground and flight testing on the Boeing YAL-1A. Unfortunately, the squadron was inactivated for good in 2012. The 339th Flight Test Squadron is a US Air Force unit based at Robins Air Force Base in Georgia. It's part of the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, and its main job is to make sure aircraft are safe to fly again after they've had maintenance work done on them. The squadron tests three types of aircraft: the Lockheed C-130 Hercules, the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy, and the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle. They do these tests to make sure these planes are ready to fly again and meet safety standards."}], "output": "  Major Ployer Peter Hill.**"},

Since 1985, he has released 20 studio albums and had more than 50 songs chart on the Billboard Hot Country Songs list, with 16 of those reaching the number-one spot. Travis is considered a significant figure in the history of country music, and his album Storms of Life (released in the mid-1980s) sold over four million copies and helped establish him as a major player in the Neotraditional country movement. He has since followed up this success with a string of platinum and multi-platinum albums, and is known for his distinctive baritone vocals, which are delivered in a traditional style that has made him a country music star since the 1980s. Gruhn Guitars is a popular musical instrument shop and attraction in Nashville, Tennessee. The store specializes in vintage instruments, but also carries new ones from reputable manufacturers. Many famous musicians and collectors visit the shop, including rock stars and well-heeled individuals. The business was founded on January 2, 1970, and gained more attention after a Visa commercial featuring it in 1992. George Gruhn, the owner, is considered the world's leading expert on vintage American guitars, according to Walter Carter, a historian and archivist for the Gibson Guitar Company. The original name of the store was GTR, which stood for George Gruhn, Tut Taylor, and Randy Wood. Hank Williams Jr. is said to have encouraged Gruhn to start the business. The store is conveniently located near the Ryman Auditorium, where many famous musicians perform. In 2006, Garrison Keillor visited Gruhn Guitars for his New Year's Eve show at the Ryman Auditorium, and Vince Gill shared a story about buying guitars from the store. Many famous musicians, including Duane Allman, Mark Knopfler, Conan O'Brien, Robert Plant, and Eric Clapton, have shopped at Gruhn Guitars. Ronnie Milsap, a well-known country music star, released his 15th studio album called Keyed Up in 1983. This album included three hit songs that reached the top of the country music charts: Stranger in My House (which reached No. 5), Don't You Know How Much I Love You (which reached No. 1), and Show Her (which also reached No. 1). Elvis Costello wrote and recorded the song Stranger in the House in 1978, with two different versions: a duet with country music star George Jones and a solo version recorded at a John Peel session. Costello wrote the song specifically for Jones, who was a major influence on his work in the country genre. According to the liner notes from the 2005 reissue of Jones' album My Very Special Guests, Costello said that Jones was his guide when writing in the country style. Randy Travis released his ninth studio album, This Is Me, on April 26, 1994, through Warner Bros. The album was produced by Kyle Lehning, Travis, and A&R executive Martha Sharp, who carefully selected over 1,000 songs before choosing the final ten tracks. Four of these songs were released as singles: Before You Kill Us All, Whisper My Name, This Is Me, and The Box. These singles reached impressive positions on the Billboard country music charts, with Before You Kill Us All peaking at #2, Whisper My Name at #1, This Is Me at #5, and The Box at #8. Interestingly, George Jones later recorded Small Y'all for his 1998 album It Don't Get Any Better Than This. Glen Campbell's recordings from before he became a famous country singer, made around 1960-1961, are included in an album called Country Music Star No. 1. This album was released after Campbell had already become well-known for his hit songs like Gentle on My Mind, By the Time I Get to Phoenix, and Wichita Lineman. However, Campbell sued the label Starday for releasing these recordings without his permission, and eventually settled the case.

The film was shot on location in Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, Arizona, and at the Montezuma Castle National Monument near Sedona. However, things didn't go as planned during filming. The local Yavapai Indians who were hired as extras refused to enter the cliff dwellings because they believed they were the dwelling place of the dead. This caused a delay in production, as the filmmakers needed to find a replacement for the Yavapai Indians. In the end, a group of Navajos were brought in from a reservation 137 miles away to take their place. Montezuma Castle National Monument in Camp Verde, Arizona is home to a group of well-preserved dwellings that were built and used by the Sinagua people, an ancient culture related to the Hohokam and other indigenous peoples of the southwestern United States. These dwellings were constructed between 1100 and 1425 AD and feature five stories and twenty rooms. It's estimated that the main structure took around 300 years to build.Château de Druyes is a medieval castle located in Druyes-les-Belles-Fontaines, Yonne, Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. It was built in the 12th century by the Counts of Nevers and remained in their possession until the 18th century. This castle served as both a noble residence and a fortified stronghold. It was a popular dwelling place for notable figures such as Peter II of Courtenay, the Emperor of Constantinople in the 13th century, and his daughter Matilda, Countess of Nevers, Auxerre, and Tonnerre. In Hebrew, the word Shamayim (שָׁמַיִם) refers to the part of the universe where God and other heavenly beings live. Shamayim actually means heavens or skies, so it's plural. The word is used to describe one of the three main parts of the universe, along with erets (the earth) and sheol (the underworld). Erets is where people and other living things live, while sheol is the place where dead people go, including the righteous dead in Christian and post-Hebrew Bible literature. In Norse mythology, Andlang (also known as Andlàngr or Öndlangr) is the second of nine heavenly realms. It's located between the first heaven, where the gods reside, and the third heaven, called Vídbláin. According to Snorri, Andlang will serve as a safe haven and home for the souls of the dead after the destruction of Ragnarök, the end of the world. The Tabernacle (or dwelling place) in the Hebrew Bible was a portable place where God lived among the Israelites during their journey from Egypt to the Promised Land. It was made of colorful curtains and wooden boards covered in gold, and had furniture made of valuable materials like silver, bronze, and precious gems. God gave specific instructions to Moses on how to build the Tabernacle at Mount Sinai, and it was transported by the Israelites during their journey through the wilderness and their conquest of the Promised Land. Later, around 300 years later, a new dwelling place for God called Solomon's Temple was built in Jerusalem, replacing the Tabernacle. In zoology, an inquiline is an animal that lives in the home of another animal, like a lodger or tenant. For example, some insects might live in a gopher's burrow and feed on leftovers or debris. Insects like ants and termites often have many inquilines living in their nests, and these species can be found in other nests as well. Inquilines are different from parasites, which are harmful to their host, and social parasites, which live in a group and rely on others for food or protection. Inquilines don't harm their hosts, and in fact, they can even help keep their homes clean by eating leftover food or debris. So while inquilines share some characteristics with parasites, they are not the same thing.   In Norse mythology, Víðbláinn is the third heaven, according to Snorri's Gylfaginning, located above the realms of Andlang and Asgard. It will serve as a safe place for the souls of the dead during and after the end of the world, known as Ragnarök. Determining which synagogue is the oldest in the United Kingdom can be tricky. Archaeologists and historians have discovered some synagogues that predate the expulsion of Jews from England, which occurred centuries ago. These synagogues have been in use for various purposes over time, such as residential buildings or places of worship for other religions. Additionally, some synagogues were rebuilt on the same site after being destroyed or demolished. This means that even if the building itself is modern, the site where it stands may have a long history of being a synagogue. Furthermore, some historic synagogues have been sold by their congregations and are now used for different purposes, such as schools or recital halls. Finally, there are some synagogues that have been in continuous use as places of worship for many centuries.   The term oldest synagogue in the world can be a bit tricky to define. There have been many ancient synagogues discovered through archaeological digs, but the age of a building doesn't always mean it's the oldest synagogue in existence. Some synagogues have been rebuilt multiple times on the same site, so while the site or congregation may be old, the actual building may not be. Additionally, some very old synagogue buildings have been used for other purposes, such as churches or mosques, for centuries. Furthermore, there are some synagogues that have been in continuous use as synagogues for many centuries, which could make them the oldest in the world."}], "output": "  The passage provides information about various dwelling places throughout history, including:\n\n1.

He has written several books, including the only official biography of the Beatles, a famous rock band. In 1967, a British film called Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush was made based on the novel of the same name by Hunter Davies. The movie was planned to be shown at the 1968 Cannes Film Festival, but the festival was cancelled due to the May 1968 events in France.The phrase Here we go round the prune bush has multiple meanings and can be used in different contexts. In a nursery rhyme, it refers to a game where children dance around a prune bush, but it can also be used to describe a situation where something is constantly changing or repeating in a cycle. For example, if someone is going through a difficult time and can't seem to escape a particular problem, you might say Here we go round the prune bush again! In this way, the phrase can be used to express frustration or annoyance at a repetitive or never-ending situation. The song The Wheels on the Bus was written by Verna Hills in the United States no later than 1939. It's a very popular children's song in the US, UK, Australia, and Canada, and kids love to sing it on bus trips to pass the time. One reason the song is so catchy is that it has a simple, repetitive melody, similar to the song 99 Bottles of Beer. The Wheels on the Bus is actually based on an older British song called Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, and some people also sing it to the tune of Buffalo Gals, as done by Raffi. Roy Holder was born on June 15, 1946, and is an English actor who has appeared in many TV shows and movies. Some of his early roles were in the 1961 movie Whistle Down the Wind and the 1967 TV shows The Taming of the Shrew, Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, Romeo and Juliet, and The Virgin Soldiers. He also appeared in the 1970 movie Loot and the 1973 movie Psychomania. In the 1970s and 1980s, he had roles in other TV shows and movies like The Land That Time Forgot, Trial by Combat, and Jesus of Nazareth. More recently, he played the role of Mr. Hill in the 2005 TV show Pride & Prejudice and Gaffer Tom in the 2010 movie Robin Hood. Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush is a popular English language nursery rhyme and singing game. It has a special number called Roud Folk Song Index number 7882. Did you know that the same tune from this rhyme is also used for other songs like Lazy Mary, Will You Get Up, and even The Wheels on the Bus? Traffic's hit single Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush is the title track from the film of the same name. The song features all four members of the band singing lead vocals together, with Steve Winwood singing solo in the bridge and parts of the chorus. The single was released in late 1967 and reached the UK Top 10. Interestingly, footage of the band performing the song was commissioned by The Beatles for their film Magical Mystery Tour, but it wasn't used in the final edit. However, the footage is now included in the special features of the 2012 DVD/Blu-ray edition of the film. Michael Finnegan (or variations like Michael Finnagen and Michael Vinnegan) is a type of song that can keep going on and on with different variations until the singer decides to stop. This song is often sung by children, and it's a popular choice for campfire sing-alongs and scouting events. The words and music of the song are unknown, but the tune bears a resemblance to Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush. The first known reference to the song is in The Hackney Scout Song Book published in 1921 by Stacy & Son Ltd.

When combined in a specific ratio of 70/30, the mixture becomes an explosive. During the early 20th century, Shellite was commonly used as a filling in armor-piercing shells used by the Royal Navy. Picric acid is a chemical compound with the formula (ON)CHOH. Its full name is 2,4,6-trinitrophenol, or TNP for short. The name picric comes from the Greek word for bitter, which refers to the bitter taste of the compound. Picric acid is one of the most acidic types of phenols, which are a class of chemicals. Historically, picric acid was used primarily as an explosive, but it has also been used in medicine (as an antiseptic) and in the production of dyes.Isopropyl alcohol, also known as propan-2-ol or dimethyl carbinol, is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CHO or CHOH or CHCHOHCH (sometimes represented as i-PrOH). It's a colorless, flammable liquid with a strong odor. This compound is called a secondary alcohol because the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms, which are linked together in a (CH)CH pattern. Isopropyl alcohol is similar to 1-propanol, but they have a slightly different chemical structure. It has a wide range of uses in industry and the home, including as an ingredient in antiseptics, disinfectants, and detergents. Alcohol is a type of organic compound that has a hydroxyl group (-OH) bonded to a carbon atom. This carbon is usually connected to other carbon or hydrogen atoms. One important class of alcohols are simple acyclic alcohols, which have the general formula CHOH. Ethanol, which has the formula CHOH, is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic drinks and is the specific type of alcohol that people usually mean when they use the term alcohol. Related articles include ones about ethanol and other types of alcohols. Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride (THPC) is a type of chemical compound called an organophosphorus compound. Its chemical formula is [P(CHOH)]Cl. The P in the formula represents a positively charged ion called a cation. In this case, the cation is four-coordinated, which means it has four atoms or groups of atoms surrounding it. THPC has important uses as a starting material for making materials that are used to fight fires. 1-Hexanol is a type of organic alcohol with a six-carbon chain. Its simple structural formula is CH(CH)OH. This colorless liquid is only slightly soluble in water, but it can mix well with other liquids like diethyl ether and ethanol. There are also two other straight chain isomers of 1-hexanol, called 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, which have the same formula but are different in terms of where the hydroxyl group is located. Many other alcohols have the same formula, CHOH. 1-Hexanol is used in the perfume industry. 1-Pentanol, also known as n-pentanol or pentan-1-ol, is a type of alcohol with five carbon atoms. Its molecular formula is CHOH. This colorless liquid has a disagreeable odor. Importantly, it is the straight-chain form of amyl alcohol, which means it is one of eight isomers with that formula. An aldonic acid is a type of sugar acid that is formed by oxidizing the aldehyde group in a sugar molecule. This process creates a carboxylic acid group, which gives the acid its characteristic formula: HOOC-(CHOH)-CHOH. Depending on which part of the molecule is oxidized, different types of acids can be formed. For example, oxidizing the terminal hydroxyl group (the top of the molecule) produces a uronic acid, while oxidizing both terminal ends (the ends of the molecule) creates an aldaric acid. Xylitol is a sweetener that comes from the Greek words xylon, meaning wood, and the suffix -itol, which means sugar alcohol. It's also known as a polyalcohol or sugar alcohol (alditol). Xylitol has the chemical formula CHOH(CHOH)CHOH and is similar to the compound pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol, but it's not chiral (meaning it doesn't have a specific handedness). Research using electron microscopy has shown that xylitol can help remineralize deeper layers of tooth enamel that have lost minerals. Some studies also found that chewing gum, lozenges, or nasal sprays containing xylitol can reduce the risk of middle ear infections in healthy children. In a mixture of a dielectric and a metallic component, something interesting happens when the proportion of metallic component reaches a certain threshold value. The formulas for the conductivity (formula 1) and dielectric constant (formula 2) of this mixture start to behave in a critical way. Near this threshold, the conductivity changes smoothly from the conductivity of the dielectric component to the conductivity of the metallic component, and this change can be described using two critical exponents, s and t. However, the dielectric constant behaves differently - it diverges when approached from either side of the threshold. To account for the frequency-dependent behavior, a simple model called the resistor-capacitor (R-C) model is used."}], "output": "  The component of shellite with the formula (ON)CHOH is picric acid."},

Many talented Argentine golfers have supported the event over the years, and some of the notable champions include Eduardo Romero, who won the tournament eight times, José Jurado, who won it seven times, Vicente Fernández, who won it five times, José Cóceres, who won it twice, and Ángel Cabrera. However, the person with the most victories in the tournament is Roberto De Vicenzo, a former British Open champion who won 16 times between 1944 and 1985. Roberto De Vicenzo was a professional golfer from Argentina who played golf from 1942 to 2017. During his career, he won over 230 golf tournaments in total, including eight on the PGA Tour. The most notable victory of his career was the 1967 Open Championship, which is considered one of the most prestigious golf tournaments in the world.In 1939, the 22nd PGA Championship was held at Pomonok Country Club in Queens, New York. This was a match play tournament, and Henry Picard won his only PGA Championship by defeating Byron Nelson with a birdie on the 37th hole. It was the second of Picard's two major titles, after he won the Masters in 1938. Nelson, on the other hand, had already won the U.S. Open three months prior to the PGA Championship, and went on to win his second title in the event in 1945. Interestingly, Nelson made it to the finals in five out of six PGA Championships held between 1939 and 1945. The Middle Atlantic PGA Championship is a significant golf tournament that takes place every year in Virginia, Maryland, or Washington, DC. It's the championship event for the Middle Atlantic section of the PGA of America, and it's been happening since 1932. The tournament has been won by some talented golfers over the years, including Fred Funk, who holds the record for the most wins with six. Other notable winners include Chandler Harper, who won the tournament seven times and the 1950 PGA Championship, Bobby Cruickshank, who won the tournament 17 times, Lew Worsham, who won it four times, and George Fazio, who won it twice and is also a well-known golf course designer. In 2000, the PGA Championship was held at the Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville, Kentucky from August 17-20. This was the 82nd PGA Championship and the second time the event was held at Valhalla, which had previously hosted the tournament in 1996. Tiger Woods won his second straight PGA Championship and fifth major title in a three-hole playoff against Bob May. Woods and May finished the tournament at 18 under par, setting a new record for the PGA Championship. This was the first time since 1937 that a PGA Championship title was successfully defended, and the first time as a stroke play event. Woods and May were five shots ahead of third-place finisher Thomas Bjørn. The Northern California PGA Championship is a prestigious golf tournament for professional golfers in Northern California. Mark Fry, a skilled golfer from Sequoyah Country Club in Oakland, has won the most championships with 10 victories. Interestingly, Tony Lema, a British Open winner in 1964 and a 12-time PGA Tour winner, won the tournament three years in a row from 1962 to 1964. Other well-known PGA Tour winners who have also won the Northern California PGA Championship include Bob Lunn, Dick Lotz, Bruce Summerhays, Bob Wynn, and John McMullin. In 2006, the PGA Championship was held at Medinah Country Club in Illinois, a suburb northwest of Chicago. This was the 88th PGA Championship, and Tiger Woods won his third title, five shots ahead of the runner-up, Shaun Micheel. Woods' victory was his 12th major championship overall. The No. 3 Course at Medinah was the longest course to host a major championship at the time, and it had previously hosted the tournament in 1999, when Woods won his first PGA Championship. The total purse for the event was $6.8 million, with the winner receiving $1.224 million. The 2018 PGA Championship is happening in August at Bellerive Country Club in Town and Country, Missouri. This is the 100th PGA Championship and the second time it's being held at Bellerive. Note that this will be the last PGA Championship held in August, as the organization announced in 2017 that the tournament will now take place in May starting from 2019. In 1977, the 59th PGA Championship was held at Pebble Beach Golf Links in California from August 11-14. Lanny Wadkins, who was just 27 years old, won his only major championship in a thrilling sudden-death playoff against Gene Littler. This was the first playoff at the PGA Championship in ten years and the first ever sudden-death playoff in a stroke-play major championship. In fact, the last time a sudden-death playoff occurred at the PGA Championship was 36 years earlier, in 1941, when the final match went to two extra holes. The 1940 PGA Championship was the 23rd edition of the competition, held from August 26 to September 2 at Hershey Country Club in Hershey, Pennsylvania, near Harrisburg. At the time, the tournament was a match play event, and Byron Nelson won his first PGA Championship by defeating Sam Snead 1 up in the 36-hole final. This victory was Nelson's third major title, and he went on to win the PGA Championship again in 1945. From 1939 to 1945, Nelson made it to the final round of the tournament five times, missing out only in 1942 when the competition was not held."}], "output": "  The Argentine PGA Championship record holder has won 16 tournaments worldwide.**"},

In Nazi Germany, the position of Abteilungsleiter, which translates to department head, was a mid-level administrative position in the Party. It was not a formal Nazi Party rank, but rather a title given to a Party member who held a leadership role in a specific department or region. The position was created in 1933, after the Nazis had taken power in Germany, and was often held by political officers attached to different regions or Gaue within the country. While the position was not a formal rank, it gave the holder significant authority and influence within the Party. The Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (ILSFDA), a law that helps protect consumers from land-related scams when buying property across state lines, has been around since 1968. The law requires sellers to provide detailed information about the property they're selling and disclose it in a document called a Property Report. Initially, the law was enforced by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), but it is now overseen by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). In 2013, a new bill called H.R. 2600 was introduced to the US House of Representatives to make changes to the ILSFDA as it relates to condominiums.

However, the bill did not pass into law when Parliament was dissolved in November of that year. But, similar legislation was reintroduced in 2013 under the name Bill C-13, known as the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act. This bill passed through all stages of legislation and received royal assent in December 2014. Campaign finance regulation in the United States has a long history, dating back to 1867. However, the modern era of campaign finance reform began in 1971 with the passage of the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA), which required candidates to disclose the sources of their campaign contributions and expenditures. In 1974, significant amendments were made to FECA, which placed limits on individual and PAC donations for the first time and created the Federal Election Commission (FEC) as an independent enforcement agency. These amendments aimed to restrict the influence of wealthy individuals by limiting donations to $1,000 and $5,000 for individuals and PACs, respectively.

Codornices Creek, which is sometimes spelled and pronounced Cordonices, is a significant creek that flows out of the Berkeley Hills in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The creek is approximately 2.0 miles long and passes through both the city of Berkeley and the adjacent city of Albany. Prior to European settlement, Codornices Creek likely did not have a direct and permanent connection to San Francisco Bay. Instead, it flowed through grasslands and filtered into a large, northward-running salt marsh and slough that also received waters from Marin Creek and Schoolhouse Creek. In the 19th century, a channel was cut through the area, and Codornices Creek now flows directly into San Francisco Bay through a narrow remnant slough located adjacent to Golden Gate Fields racetrack.

He died at Spynie Palace near Elgin sometime before November 7, 1435. Spynie Palace, also known as Spynie Castle, was the residence of the Bishops of Moray for approximately 500 years. The palace was built in the late 12th century and is located at grid reference NJ 230658, about 500 meters from the site of the first officially established cathedral church of the Diocese of Moray, which is now Spynie Churchyard. Until the 16th century, the castle was not referred to as a palace, but rather as a fortified residence. The term palace was first used in a writ from 1524.The title Earl of Dunbar was a noble title held in south-eastern Scotland from the early 12th century until the early 15th century. The first person to use this title was Gospatric II, Earl of Lothian, who was the son of Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The title then passed down through generations until it was held by George de Dunbar, the 11th Earl of March, who lost his titles and estates in 1435 after being convicted by Parliament. George's son Patrick retained a barony in Fife, known as Kilconquhar. George de Dunbar, the 11th Earl of Dunbar and March Lord of Annandale and the Isle of Man, lived from around 1370 to after 1457. He was the last member of his family to hold these titles, which were important positions of power and influence in Scotland and the Isle of Man. Haripur Barabari (Bengali: হরিপুর বড়বাড়ি) is a palace located in Horipur Union of Nasirnagar Upazila in Brahmanbaria district, Bangladesh. Earlier, it was known as East Bengal. The palace was founded by Jamindar Krishna Prasad Roy Choudhury in the 18th century. Gospatric or Cospatric (also known as the Servant of Saint Patrick) lived after 1073 and was either the Earl of Northumbria or Bernicia, and later owned large estates around Dunbar. While we're not sure about his father's family history, his descendants held the Earldom of Dunbar, which was later called the Earldom of March in southeast Scotland, until 1435. Patrick IV, Earl of March, was a powerful nobleman in the Scottish border regions during the 13th century. He was also known as Patrick de Dunbar, 8th Earl of March. He was one of the leading contenders for the Scottish throne, a position that made him a key figure in the country's political landscape. George de Dunbar, who lived from 1338 to 1420, was one of the most powerful nobles in Scotland during his time. He held several important titles, including Earl of Dunbar and March, Lord of Annandale, and Lord of the Isle of Man. He was a rival of the Douglases, another influential family in Scotland.

Sadly, he passed away on September 13, 2013, at the age of 64, after battling cancer in his hometown of Dupont, Washington. Bishop Dunbar's Hospital was founded in 1531 by Bishop Gavin Dunbar, who endowed the hospital before he died. Dunbar asked King James V of Scotland to approve the foundation of the hospital, and the king granted his request. The hospital was called St Mary's Hospital and was located near the cathedral church but outside the cemetery. In his mortification, Dunbar outlined the charitable purpose of the hospital, which was to support bedesmen (people who prayed in a cycle of Divine Office). The Bedesmen used to live in the Bede House in Old Aberdeen from 1789 until the end of the 19th century. Unfortunately, the original 1531 building is no longer standing, but a perimeter wall from the hospital can be seen in Seaton Park in Old Aberdeen. The last Bedesman passed away in 1988.

In Santa Claus' Visit from 1900, Santa appeared on the roof, entered the chimney, and distributed presents to the children.\n\nIn the early 1900s, films continued to show Santa's visit, with some featuring children setting traps to catch him. For example, in A Trap for Santa Claus from 1909, children tried to capture their father who had abandoned them and their mother, but instead caught him trying to burglarize the house.\n\nIn the 1920s, films about Santa became more elaborate, with one featuring Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer. Another film from 1926, also with sound, showed Santa visiting a family and bringing them gifts.\n\nOver the years, many actors have played Santa Claus, including Monty Woolley, Alberto Rabagliati, Dan Aykroyd, Jan Rubes, David Huddleston, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, and Ed Asner. Some films featured Santa in different settings, such as exploring the Arctic or visiting a modern family. Other films focused on different aspects of Santa's life, such as his workshop or his relationship with Mrs. Claus.

This book is credited with playing a crucial role in advancing the feminist movement. Journalist Liza Featherstone has acknowledged that Millett's efforts have contributed to several significant advancements in women's rights, including the legalization of abortion, greater gender equality in the workplace, and a greater sense of sexual freedom. In other words, Millett's work has helped pave the way for many of the rights and freedoms that women enjoy today. Kate Millett wrote the book Sexual Politics in 1970, which was based on her PhD dissertation. The book provides an in-depth analysis of the relationship between sex and power, and how it affects society. Millett's groundbreaking work challenged traditional notions of gender roles and sexuality, and it remains an influential work in the fields of feminist theory and sexual politics.Jane Rule's 1980 novel, Contract with the World, is set in Vancouver, British Columbia in the mid-1970s.

They believe that there is scientific debate about the validity of Darwin's theory of evolution, which is rejected by many leading scientific bodies, including the Royal Society and over 50 Academies of Science around the world. Despite this, Truth in Science is affiliated with the Discovery Institute, a hub of the intelligent design movement, and promotes their materials in an effort to get pseudoscientific creationism taught alongside evolution in schools. The Discovery Institute (DI) is a conservative non-profit organization based in Seattle, Washington, that promotes the idea of intelligent design (ID). This is a pseudoscientific theory that argues that certain features of the world can only be explained by the intervention of a designer, rather than natural processes. The DI's Teach the Controversy campaign aims to encourage teachers to include ID in science classes alongside established scientific theories, such as evolution. The campaign claims that there is a scientific debate about these topics, when in fact the overwhelming consensus among scientists is that evolution is the most well-supported and evidence-based explanation for the diversity of life on Earth.Every Voice is a nonprofit organization that advocates for political campaign finance reform in the United States. It was created in 2014 when two groups, the Public Campaign Action Fund and Friends of Democracy, merged. Every Voice and its affiliated Super PAC, Every Voice Action, work together to push for public financing of political campaigns and limits on political donations. The organization's leader, David Donnelly, has acknowledged the irony of using a Super PAC (a group that can raise unlimited amounts of money) to fight the influence of Super PACs (which are also able to raise unlimited amounts of money). Spirit Caravan's final album, The Last Embrace, was released in 2003 by Meteor City Records. It includes 19 songs from their previous albums, Jug Fulla Sun and Elusive Truth, as well as three songs from their debut album (released under the name Shine), two songs from their final album, and a song from their split 7-inch with Sixty Watt Shaman. Additionally, the album features the last three songs the band recorded: The Last Embrace, Brainwashed, and Dove-Tongued Aggressor. The Discovery Museum and Planetarium in Bridgeport, Connecticut is a science museum that's both fun for tourists and a valuable resource for local schools. The museum offers interactive science exhibits and activities that spark curiosity and encourage visitors to learn through hands-on experiences.

By providing a fun and engaging environment, the Discovery Museum inspires young minds to explore and learn. Truth Initiative is a nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing tobacco use, especially among youth and young adults. It was created in 1999 as a result of a settlement between states and the tobacco industry. Truth Initiative is best known for its youth smoking prevention campaign, but it also conducts research, organizes community programs, and develops digital cessation and prevention products. In 2015, the organization changed its name from the American Legacy Foundation to Truth Initiative to better match its mission. As of 2016, Truth Initiative had over $957 million in assets and a staff of 133 based in Washington, D.C. In 1986, the band Extrema was formed in Milan, Italy. The original lineup included guitarist Tommy Massara, vocalist/guitarist Andrea Boria, bassist Luca Varisco, and drummer Stefano Bullegas. They were one of the first thrash metal bands in Italy and released their first EP, We F**kin' Care, in 1987. Unfortunately, local heavy metal fans were not supportive of their music, so the band had to open for visiting bands like Slayer, D.R.I., and Corrosion of Conformity for four years. To get noticed, the band decided to take matters into their own hands and started sending their demos to international heavy metal critics. They even financed a trip to New York City for a one-off gig, which paid off when their four-track demo from 1991 started getting attention from major international publications. This led to a record deal with Contempo Records, which allowed them to release their debut album, Tension at the Seams, in 1993. The album featured an unconventional cover of The Police's Truth Hits Everybody and spawned a music video for the track Child O' Boogaow, which was played heavily on Italy's MTV affiliate, Videomusic. As a result of their hard work and determination, the band was able to secure stadium support slots with Italian rock star Vasco Rossi and perform at a high-profile metal festival alongside metal legends like Megadeth, The Cult, Suicidal Tendencies, and Metallica. The truth campaign is a nationwide effort to reduce smoking among young people in the United States. The campaign is produced and funded by the American Legacy Foundation, a nonprofit organization established in 1999 as part of a settlement between tobacco companies and 46 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and five territories. The truth campaign creates TV and online content to teach young people about the dangers of smoking and encourage them to stay away from cigarettes. In August 2014, the campaign launched a new phase called Finish It, which aims to inspire young people to be the generation that ends smoking for good.

They take him in, hoping to help him, but they soon discover that he has come to help the townspeople as well. No one knows who he is or where he came from, and some think he might be a miracle or a fake prophet. The town's sheriff, Brody, is determined to uncover the truth, but he has his own struggles keeping the town together. Miracles start happening in the town, and the residents begin to embrace the boy, but when the beloved doctor dies, the truth must be revealed. The boy pleads with Brody to believe that he's come to help, not harm anyone, and finally, with his back against the wall, he reveals his true identity.

Watkins was a founding member, lead vocalist, and lyricist of the rock band Lostprophets, which gained popularity. However, in 2012, Watkins was charged with sexual offenses and the band disbanded in 2013. In November 2013, he pleaded guilty to 13 charges, including attempting to rape and sexually assault children under the age of 13. These crimes were committed against the infants of two women who were also convicted. Watkins was sentenced to 29 years in prison and an additional six years on extended license. Joseph Scott Sappington, better known by his stage name Josey Scott, was the lead vocalist of the rock band Saliva. In addition to being the lead singer of Saliva, Josey Scott also co-wrote and performed a song called Hero with Chad Kroeger of the band Nickelback. Hero was used as one of the theme songs for the 2002 movie Spider-Man.Lostprophets, a Welsh alternative rock band, released Where We Belong as their second single from their fourth studio album, The Betrayed. The song was released on January 4, 2010, and vocalist Ian Watkins told Kerrang! that although the song may sound happy and catchy, the lyrics could also be interpreted as saying that the band belongs in hell. The single reached number 32 on the Official UK top 40 chart on January 10, 2010. The band wrote the song after returning to their native Wales after recording in Los Angeles, and they described it as their love letter to home. Lostprophets, a Welsh rock band, released a song called Shinobi vs. Dragon Ninja in 2001. The song was written by the band's lead singer, Ian Watkins, and was included on their debut studio album, The Fake Sound of Progress. This was the only song from the album that charted on the Billboard charts, and it remained a part of the band's live setlist until they disbanded in 2013. The song Family Reunion is from Saliva's sixth studio album, called Cinco Diablo. The lead singer of the band, Josey Scott, has explained that the song is about meeting their fans during their concerts on the road. According to Billboard, the song reached #14 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 2008. Lostprophets was a Welsh rock band from Pontypridd, Wales, formed in 1997. The band was started by lead singer and songwriter Ian Watkins, along with bassist (later guitarist) Mike Lewis, drummer Mike Chiplin, and guitarist Lee Gaze. Initially, Lostprophets was a side project for Watkins and Lewis while they were also playing in the hardcore punk band Public Disturbance. The band was also part of the vibrant music scene in Cardiff. Saliva's seventh studio album, Under Your Skin, was released in 2011. This was the final album to feature the band's lead singer, Josey Scott, who left the group in 2012. Interestingly, the album had been titled differently before its release - it was originally called Take That Society and then Skin Deep. Lostprophets, a Welsh alternative rock band, was set to release We Bring an Arsenal as their second single from their fifth studio album, Weapons, on June 4, 2012. However, the single has only been played on rock radio stations in the United States since that date, and it has yet to be officially released in the UK as of June 5, 2012. This is unlikely to happen due to the imprisonment of the band's lead singer, Ian Watkins, in 2013. The song was first performed live on February 25, 2012, in Brisbane, Australia. Saliva's eighth studio album, In It to Win It, was released in 2013 after the band's lead singer, Josey Scott, left the group in 2012. This album was initially released through a record label called Rum Bum Records on September 3, 2013. Unfortunately, the album is no longer available for purchase as the band has since re-released it under the title Rise Up. The only songs that are missing from the new version are Animal, Flesh, and I.D.N.A.E. The song Always by the rock band Saliva was the first single released from their album Back into Your System in 2003.

It was named after the Battle of Maiwand, which took place during the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878-1880). The statue was erected in 1884 to honor the 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot who died in the battle. Locals sometimes refer to the statue as the Forbury Lion. The Reading Post (formerly known as the Reading Evening Post) was a local newspaper that served the town of Reading, Berkshire, and surrounding areas. The newspaper's title page featured an iconic image of the Maiwand Lion, a well-known landmark located at Forbury Gardens. The Reading Post was published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd., a division of Trinity Mirror plc, until 2009.The Kargil War Memorial, also known as the Vijaypath, is a war memorial built by the Indian Army in Dras, near the foothills of Tololing Hill. The memorial is around 5 kilometers away from the city center and is located on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway 1D. It honors the soldiers and officers of the Indian Army who died during the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan, which became known as the Kargil War. The memorial has a large epitaph with the names of all the soldiers who died in the war. Every year on July 26, the Prime Minister of India pays tribute to the soldiers at the Amar Jawan Jyothi at the India Gate in New Delhi, while simultaneously celebrating Kargil Vijay Diwas at the memorial. The main attraction of the memorial is a sandstone wall with the names of all the Indian army personnel who lost their lives during the war. Visitors can also see some of the peaks that were captured back from Pakistan. To commemorate the 13th anniversary of India's victory in the war, a giant national flag was hoisted at the Kargil war memorial, weighing 15 kilograms. The Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial located on the cathedral green in Exeter, the capital of Devon, in southwest England. It was designed by renowned architect Sir Edwin Lutyens and is one of fifteen War Crosses he designed to a similar specification. Of these, only two were meant to serve as civic memorials in cities. Initially, the Devon County War Memorial Committee wanted to build a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to honor the county's war dead, but due to funding issues, this plan was abandoned. After considering several proposals, the committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead. They chose to locate the memorial on the green in front of the cathedral after scouting several sites. Unfortunately, the committee failed to work together with another committee responsible for creating a war memorial for Exeter, resulting in two separate memorials - one for the county on the cathedral green and another for the city in Northernhay Gardens. Manchester Cenotaph is a memorial for the First World War, with additions for later conflicts, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square, Manchester, England. Manchester was late in creating a war memorial compared to other British towns and cities, as the city council didn't form a war memorial committee until 1922. Once the committee raised £10,000, they faced a challenge in finding a suitable location for the monument. Some artists opposed the idea of moving statues in Albert Square, so the council considered Piccadilly Gardens instead. However, the council decided to build the memorial in St Peter's Square instead, even though it already had a memorial cross for the former St Peter's Church. Unfortunately, negotiations to move the cross failed, so the war memorial was constructed with the cross in its original location. The York City War Memorial was built to honor the soldiers who died in the First World War. The idea for the memorial started in 1919, but there was controversy over what it should look like and where it should be built. Some people wanted it to be a functional building, while others wanted it to be a monument. After a public meeting in January 1920, the decision was made to build a monument. The city's engineer gave an estimate of the cost, and the war memorial committee hired a famous architect named Sir Edwin Lutyens to design it. Lutyens' first design was approved, but some people in the community didn't like it because they thought it wouldn't match the old buildings in York. They also thought the memorial for the North Eastern Railway (NER) would be too big and overshadow the city's memorial. The committee had to pick a new site for the memorial, and Lutyens came up with a new design that was simpler and cheaper. Spalding War Memorial is a memorial to those who died in the First World War located in the beautiful gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall in Spalding, Lincolnshire, England. The memorial was designed by the famous architect Sir Edwin Lutyens. In January 1918, Barbara McLaren, the wife of the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, who was killed in a tragic flying accident during the war, came up with the idea of building a memorial to Spalding's war dead. She reached out to Lutyens through a mutual acquaintance and he designed a stunning plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, with a cross in the middle. The memorial was to be built in the beautiful gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local government.\n\nWhen McLaren presented her proposal to the council, there was a lot of debate among the community and some alternative ideas were suggested. After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a smaller version of McLaren's original proposal was chosen as the preferred option, along with a clock to be placed on the town's corn exchange building.

He was the son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the founder of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle. Aonghus Mór took over as leader after his father's death in the middle of the 13th century. At that time, the rulers of the Isles were very independent and only nominally acknowledged the authority of the Scottish Crown. However, Aonghus Mór became involved in helping Irish tribes resist the growing power of the Anglo-Irish in northern Ireland. This could have been part of a larger effort by Clann Domhnaill and other Irish kindreds to form alliances and gain support against Scottish encroachment. The Kingdom of the Isles was a group of islands in the North Atlantic that existed from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. These islands included the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde, and the Isle of Man. The Norse people called these islands the Suðreyjar, or Southern Isles, to distinguish them from the Norðreyjar or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland. The historical records are incomplete, so we don't know much about the kingdom's exact boundaries and rulers. Some of the rulers called themselves kings of Mann and the Isles, but not all of them did. The islands are quite large, covering over 8300 square kilometers and stretching more than 500 kilometers from north to south. During this time, the islands had overlords from Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland, or Orkney, but they also had periods of independence. There were also competing claims for some or all of the territory.In the 13th and 14th centuries, the leaders of the Clann Domhnaill clan before they became known as Lords of the Isles were called Lord of Islay. The first person to use this title was Aonghus Mór, the son of the clan's founder, Domhnall mac Raghnaill. The title of Lord of Islay was commonly used by these leaders and later members of the clan. Forests in Himachal Pradesh cover a vast area of 37,691 square kilometers, which is about 38.3% of the state's total land area. In the past, these forests were a significant source of income for the state, but most of the original forests were cleared. However, the focus has shifted from exploiting the forests to conserving them. The state government is working to increase the forest cover to 50% of the total land area through various projects, such as establishing protected areas like National Parks, to preserve and expand the forests. The Ashanti Region is located in southern Ghana and is the third largest of the country's 10 administrative regions, covering an area of 24,389 square kilometers (or about 10.2% of Ghana's total land area). Despite being the third largest in terms of land area, the Ashanti Region is the most populated, with a population of 4,780,380 people according to the 2010 census, which accounts for about 19.4% of Ghana's total population. The region is known for its significant production of gold bars and cocoa. The largest city and regional capital is Kumasi. Tasmania, the southernmost state of Australia, is made up of several islands. The main island of Tasmania is the largest, covering an area of 64,103 square kilometers (94.1% of the state's total land area).

The band consisted of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. They became known as the most influential rock band of their time and were widely regarded as the best act of the rock era. The Beatles got their start in music by playing a mix of skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll. As their music evolved, they experimented with different styles, including pop ballads, Indian music, psychedelia, and hard rock. They also used unusual recording techniques and incorporated classical elements into their music. In 1963, the Beatles became extremely popular, and their music grew more sophisticated over the years. The band's primary songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, were seen as symbols of the ideals of the 1960s counterculture.

As a 15-year-old girl, Marsha introduced The Beatles' song I Want to Hold Your Hand on American radio for the first time on December 17, 1963. This was a significant moment because it forced a major record company to release the Beatles' debut single earlier than planned, during the holiday season when record companies typically didn't release new music. Beatles historian and author Bruce Spizer confirmed this in 2004. Cargo Records was a Canadian independent record label and distributor that operated in the 1980s and 1990s.

The Orioles are one of the original eight teams in the AL, established in 1901, and started their first season as the Milwaukee Brewers in Wisconsin before moving to St. Louis, Missouri and becoming the St. Louis Browns. After 52 years in St. Louis, the team was purchased by a group of Baltimore business and civic leaders, including lawyer/civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr., in 1953. The team is currently majority-owned by lawyer Peter Angelos. Marcus Wayne Garland was a professional baseball player who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine seasons from 1973 to 1981. During this time, he played for the Baltimore Orioles from 1973 to 1976 and the Cleveland Indians from 1977 to 1981. Garland was one of the lucky few players who benefited from the introduction of MLB free agency in 1976. However, his career was cut short due to a serious injury to his arm, which made it difficult for him to perform at his best. Despite his best efforts, he was constantly criticized by the Cleveland Indians' management and fans for not living up to his contract, even though his decline in performance was caused by the injury. In fact, fans were so upset with him that they would boo him and even vandalize his car during games.The Washington Senators baseball team was one of the original eight teams in the American League. They were founded in Washington, D.C. in 1901 and were known as the Senators until 1957, when they changed their name to the Washington Nationals. However, the name Nationals only appeared on their uniforms for two seasons before being replaced by the W logo for the next 52 years. Despite this, the names Senators, Nationals, and Nats were still used interchangeably by fans and the media for many years. In 2005, the team that had previously played in Montreal as the Expos adopted the name Washington Nationals. During their early years, the Senators were one of the most successful teams in Major League Baseball, with players like Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, Joe Cronin, Bucky Harris, Heinie Manush, and Walter Johnson. However, they are also remembered for their many years of mediocrity and struggling to win, including six last-place finishes in the 1940s and 1950s. Other notable players who played for the Senators but didn't get much recognition include Joe Judge, Cecil Travis, Buddy Myer, Roy Sievers, and Eddie Yost.

This lamp produces a brighter light, around 6 to 10 candela, compared to earlier lamps. The lamp's design allows for more complete combustion of the candle wick and oil, which means it needs to be trimmed less often. The Lewis lamp is a special light fixture used in lighthouses. It was invented by Winslow Lewis and patented in 1810. The Lewis lamp used less oil than other lamps used before it, which made it a big selling point. It worked like an Argand lamp, but with some extra parts to help it shine brighter. The inventor of the Argand lamp, Aimé Argand, came up with a similar design that became popular in Europe. However, the Lewis lamp design was chosen by the United States to be used in their lighthouses.A hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is a type of lamp that is used in physics and chemistry for producing specific wavelengths of light. HCLs are particularly useful in atomic absorption spectrometers and lasers because they can produce a steady, consistent stream of light at a specific frequency. The hollow cathode effect is what makes HCLs so useful - it allows them to conduct electricity at a lower voltage and with more current than other types of lamps, making them more efficient and reliable. In simple terms, the hollow cathode effect allows the lamp to suck up electricity more efficiently, which means it can produce more light with less power. Antoine Quinquet was a French pharmacist who was born in Soissons on March 9, 1745. After completing his apprenticeship as an apothecary in Soissons in 1760, he moved to Paris in 1777 to work for a pharmacist named Antoine Baumé. During his time in Paris, Quinquet met Aimé Argand, a well-known pharmacist from Geneva. In 1779, Quinquet returned to Paris and opened his own pharmacy, where he worked for the rest of his life. A kerosene lamp, also known as a paraffin lamp in some countries, is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene as fuel. Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle that glows, and they are protected by a glass chimney or globe. These lamps can be placed on a table or used as hand-held lanterns for portable lighting. They are useful for lighting areas without electricity, such as in rural areas without electricity, during power outages, at campsites, and on boats. There are three main types of kerosene lamps: flat wick, central draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp. Portable kerosene lanterns come in different variants, such as dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast. A glow switch starter is a type of preheat starter used with fluorescent lamps. It's filled with either neon gas or argon gas and has a bimetallic strip and a stationary electrode. When current flows through the starter, the gas inside ionizes and heats the bimetallic strip, which then bends towards the stationary electrode and connects the two electrodes of the fluorescent lamp. This process repeats until the lamp is lit. Unfortunately, one disadvantage of glow switch starters is that when the lamp is near the end of its life, it will blink on and off continuously until the starter wears out or one of the electrodes on the lamp burns out. The qulliq (also known as a seal-oil lamp, blubber lamp, or soapstone lamp) is a traditional oil lamp used by people living in the Arctic regions, including the Inuit, Chukchi, and Yupik peoples. A trouble light, also known as a rough service light, drop light, or inspection lamp, is a special lamp designed to illuminate dark or hard-to-reach areas. It can withstand some rough handling and has a protective cage around the light bulb. The lamp also has a long power cord, which allows it to be used from a distance, and some models may have an electrical outlet on the handle, allowing the light to also serve as an extension cord. The Hefner lamp, also known as Hefnerkerze in German, is a special type of lamp used in photometry. It burns a substance called amyl acetate, which produces a consistent and controlled amount of light. Nikola Tesla invented the carbon button lamp, a type of incandescent lamp that's simple in design. Inside the lamp, there's a small carbon sphere placed in the middle of a vacuum-sealed glass bulb. To make the lamp work, we need to pass a high-frequency alternating current through it. When the current flows through the lamp, it creates an electric arc or a vacuum arc around the carbon electrode, which heats up the electrode to incandescence. This happens because the ions in the lamp collide with the carbon electrode, generating heat that makes it glow. Tesla discovered that these lamps could also emit harmful radiation, making them useful for certain applications."}], "output": "  The lamp used in many lighthouses is similar to the Argand lamp, which was patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand. **"},

In the horticulture industry, it is commonly abbreviated as Lc. This means that Laeliocattleya is a group of plants that have characteristics of both Laelia and Cattleya, and are bred to produce new and unique orchid hybrids. Broughtonia is a type of orchid (family Orchidaceae) that is found in the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles. In trade journals, this genus is often abbreviated as Bro.Broughtonia sanguinea, also known as Blood Red Broughtonia, is a type of plant in the Broughtonia genus. This genus is part of the Orchidaceae family, and is commonly referred to by the abbreviation Bro in trade journals.   William Henry Nicholls was an Australian botanist and photographer who was particularly interested in orchids. He wrote many articles about orchids for a scientific journal called The Victorian Naturalist, and he even contributed drawings of new species he discovered. Nicholls was working on a big project to illustrate all the different types of orchids in Australia, but he sadly passed away before he could finish the whole series. However, his work was later published in a single book called Orchids of Australia in 1969. Nicholls named many different types of orchids, and some of the names he gave them are still used today, such as Caladenia caudata, Caladenia echidnachila, and Caladenia ornata. Otaara, commonly referred to as Otr in the horticultural trade, is a type of orchid that is created by cross-breeding different orchid genera. These genera include Brassavola, Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia, and Sophronitis. By combining the genetic material from these different genera, Otaara creates a unique and diverse group of orchids with desirable traits. Paracaleana, also known as duck orchids, is a group of flowering plants in the orchid family (Orchidaceae) found in Australia and New Zealand. These orchids are found in all Australian states, but they haven't been spotted in the Northern Territory. While they look similar to Caleana major, there are some differences in their flowers and the insects that pollinate them. Paracaleana orchids, along with hammer orchids (Drakaea), are pollinated by male thynnid wasps. These orchids have only one leaf and produce one or a few dull-colored, inconspicuous flowers. Caladenia, also known as spider orchids, is a group of 350 species of plants in the orchid family (Orchidaceae). These plants are actually terrestrial herbs, meaning they grow in the ground, and they have a single hairy leaf and a hairy stem. One of the most distinctive features of spider orchids is the labellum, which is fringed or toothed in most species. The labellum is the lower petal of the flower, and it often has small projections called calli. These adaptations help attract specific types of insects for pollination. The genus Caladenia is divided into three groups based on the shape of the flower: spider orchids, zebra orchids, and cowslip orchids. While they can be found in other countries, the majority of spider orchids are from Australia, where there are 136 species, making it the most species-rich orchid genus in Western Australia. Calochilus, also known as beard orchids, is a group of about 30 species of plants in the orchid family (Orchidaceae). These plants are different from other Australian orchids because they don't have any tubers and can't reproduce by producing new tubers. Instead, they self-pollinate when they don't get cross-pollinated. Beard orchids are usually found in Australia, but some species can also be found in New Zealand, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. Another interesting thing about beard orchids is that they have a thick layer of hair on their special part (called the labellum) that gives them their common name. Cattleytonia is a type of orchid that is created by crossing two other types of orchids, Cattleya and Broughtonia. In the horticulture industry, it is commonly referred to by the abbreviation Ctna. In the world of horticulture, Hawkinsara (often shortened to Hknsa) is a unique type of orchid. It's actually a hybrid of four different orchid genera: Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia, and Sophronitis. Put simply, this means that Hawkinsara is a cross between these four genera, creating a new and interesting type of orchid."}], "output": "  Yes, Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya are both types of orchids.\n\nBroughtonia is a type of orchid (family Orchidaceae) that is found in the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles. It is commonly referred to as Bro. in trade journals.\n\nLaeliocattleya, on the other hand, is a type of orchid hybrid that is created by crossing two other types of orchids, Laelia and Cattleya. In the horticulture industry, it is commonly abbreviated as Lc. This means that Laeliocattleya is a group of plants that have characteristics of both Laelia and Cattleya, and are bred to produce new and unique orchid hybrids.\n\nSo, while Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya are both types of orchids, they are different in terms of their genus and the way they are created."},

They have only advanced to the knockout rounds once, when they reached the round of 16 in 2014 before losing to Germany. Interestingly, 32 years prior, Algeria came close to advancing to the second round of the 1982 World Cup after defeating both West Germany and Chile. However, an arrangement match between West Germany and Austria ultimately eliminated them. In 2014, Algeria finally qualified for the round of 16 for the first time. The 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th FIFA World Cup, a tournament for men's national football teams held every four years. This particular tournament took place in Brazil from June 12 to July 13, 2014, after Brazil was chosen to host the event in 2007. It was Brazil's second time hosting the World Cup, with the first time being in 1950. Additionally, it was the fifth time the tournament was held in South America.The opening ceremonies of the 2015 Cricket World Cup took place on the eve of the tournament in New Zealand and Australia. Both ceremonies occurred simultaneously, one in North Hagley Park in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the other in Melbourne, Australia. Thousands of fans attended the events in each location. This was significant because it was the first major sporting event held in Christchurch since the devastating 2011 earthquake.   Orvar Bergmark was a talented Swedish football player and manager, born on November 16, 1930, and passed away on May 10, 2004. As a manager, he played a crucial role in qualifying the Swedish national football team for the FIFA World Cup in Mexico in 1970, after defeating France and other teams in the qualifying rounds. This was a significant achievement, as it marked Sweden's first appearance in a World Cup in 12 years and their first qualification in 20 years, following their hosting of the 1958 FIFA World Cup. However, Sweden did not qualify for the World Cups in 1954, 1962, and 1966. The 2002 FIFA World Cup was the 17th edition of the tournament held from May 31 to June 30, 2002, in South Korea and Japan. This was the first World Cup held in Asia and the first to take place on a continent other than Europe or the Americas. It was also the last tournament where the golden goal rule was in effect, and the only one to be jointly hosted by multiple countries. Brazil won the tournament for the fifth time, defeating Germany 2-0 in the final. This victory qualified Brazil for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and made them the World representatives. In the third-place match, Turkey defeated South Korea 3-2 to take third place. This was Turkey's second appearance in the World Cup finals, while China PR, Ecuador, Senegal, and Slovenia made their debuts. Russia, Sweden, and the Republic of Ireland returned to the tournament after missing the 1998 edition. The 1991 Rugby World Cup was the second edition of the tournament, held in Europe and jointly hosted by five countries: England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and France. This was the first Rugby World Cup to be held in the northern hemisphere, and it received more attention than the inaugural tournament in 1987 due to increased interest in the sport. To qualify for the tournament, a total of 33 countries participated, with eight automatic qualifiers from the previous tournament and 25 additional countries competing in qualifying matches. Unfortunately, only one new team qualified for the tournament, replacing Tonga with Western Samoa. The tournament format remained the same as the previous edition, with minor changes to the points system. The Ukrainian national football team (Ukrainian: Збірна України з футболу) represents Ukraine in international football competitions. After Ukraine gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, the team played its first match against Hungary on April 29, 1992. Ukraine's biggest achievement in international football was reaching the quarterfinals of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which was also their first appearance in a major championship. As the host nation, Ukraine automatically qualified for the UEFA Euro 2012 tournament. Four years later, they qualified for Euro 2016 through the playoff route, which was their first time qualifying for a UEFA European Championship through the qualifying process. This marks their fifth playoff appearance, and they finally managed to win the tie after failing in previous playoff matches for the Euro 2000, 2002 World Cup, 2010 World Cup, and 2014 World Cup. The 1968-1969 football season in Belgium was the 66th year of competitive football in the country. Standard Club Liégeois won their fourth Division I title. Unfortunately, no Belgian team was able to advance beyond the second round of European competitions, but there was some consolation as six Belgian clubs qualified for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, which was a major achievement. K Lierse SK won the Belgian Cup final against RR White with a score of 2-0. The Belgium national football team continued their FIFA World Cup qualification campaign with three home victories against other teams in Group 6 (Finland, Yugoslavia, and Spain) and a draw in Spain. This was a significant achievement for Belgium, as they qualified for the 1970 FIFA World Cup finals in Mexico for the first time since 1954, marking a major milestone in their football history. The Tertiary Student Rugby League World Cup, also known as the University Rugby League World Cup, was first held in 1986 in New Zealand. This was the first time that teams from five different countries, who were not the best first-grade teams, competed in a Rugby League World Cup hosted by the Rugby League International Federation. The Switzerland women's national football team represents Switzerland in international women's soccer competitions. They were established in 1972 and have been competing in various tournaments since then. In 2015, they qualified for the FIFA Women's World Cup, which will be their first time participating in the tournament. This is also the first time both the men's and women's teams from Switzerland have qualified for a World Cup simultaneously.

American and Filipino soldiers fought against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. The battle lasted for a month and resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 civilians and the complete destruction of the city. The fighting was some of the worst in the Pacific and Japanese soldiers committed mass murder against Filipino civilians. The battle also destroyed important historical buildings and cultural landmarks that date back to the city's founding. After three years of Japanese occupation, the city was finally captured, which was a key victory for General Douglas MacArthur in the campaign to retake the Philippines. During the American Civil War, there were six major battles fought over the course of seven days in June and July 1862 near Richmond, Virginia. Confederate General Robert E. Lee successfully drove the Union Army of the Potomac, led by Major General George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula. Although some people call this series of battles the Seven Days Campaign, it was actually the final part of a larger military operation known as the Peninsula Campaign.During the Seven Days Battles of the American Civil War, which took place from June 25 to July 1, 1862, several Confederate States Army units and commanders fought. We compiled the list of these units and commanders based on the army organization during the battle, casualty returns, and reports. In addition, we have included the Union order of battle in a separate list. Here are the Confederate units and commanders that participated in the battles During the Seven Days Battles of the American Civil War, which took place from June 25 to July 1, 1862, several Union Army units and commanders fought on the Union side.

The Confederate units that fought in the battle are listed separately.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. On June 8, 1862, a significant battle called the Battle of Cross Keys took place in Rockingham County, Virginia, during the American Civil War. This battle was part of Confederate General Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley. The following day, on June 9, there was another important battle called the Battle of Port Republic, which was also part of Jackson's Valley Campaign. These two battles were crucial victories for the Confederacy, as they forced the Union army to retreat and allowed Jackson to reinforce General Robert E. Lee's troops outside of Richmond, Virginia, for a series of battles known as the Seven Days Battles. On June 27, 1862, during the American Civil War, the Battle of Gaines's Mill took place in Hanover County, Virginia. This battle was the third of the Seven Days Battles (Peninsula Campaign) and occurred after an inconclusive battle the day before at Beaver Dam Creek (now Mechanicsville). Confederate General Robert E. Lee tried to attack the isolated Union Army, which was positioned on the northern side of the Chickahominy River. The Union's V Corps, led by Brigadier General Fitz John Porter, had set up a strong defensive line behind Boatswain's Swamp. Lee's forces consisted of about 57,000 men in six divisions, and they launched a series of attacks throughout the day. Despite heavy casualties, Porter's troops held their ground until reinforcements arrived from the VI Corps. However, the arrival of Major General Stonewall Jackson's command was delayed, preventing the Confederates from fully concentrating their forces before the Union troops received reinforcements. During the American Civil War, Savage's Station was a crucial supply depot, ammunition dump, field hospital, and command headquarters for the Army of the Potomac. Located in Henrico County, Virginia, along the Richmond and York River Railroad, the station was operational during the Peninsula Campaign. However, the historical department of the Norfolk Southern Railroad, which owns the railroad track today, has no records of a train station or house on the property. A farmhouse was located nearby, in a grove of trees next to the railroad track, and it is visible in period drawings and photographs from the war. The house served as a large field hospital during and after the Battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles, and it also functioned as General George B. McClellan's headquarters during the Battle of Savage's Station on June 29, 1862. Unfortunately, the house was burned by Federal cavalry under General Philip H. Sheridan in 1864. The house was never rebuilt, and no trace of it remains today. A 19th-century smokehouse on the property survived until the 1930s, when it was photographed during a survey of local historical structures as part of the Civilian Conservation Corps. The smokehouse fell into ruin and collapsed before the 1980s. A small 18th-century cemetery still exists near the former location of the house, not far from the railroad track. On June 9, 1862, a significant battle called the Battle of Port Republic took place in Rockingham County, Virginia, during the American Civil War. This battle was part of Confederate General Thomas Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley. The battle was a fierce and intense fight between two equally determined opponents, and it was the most costly battle fought by Jackson's Army of the Valley during its campaign. The battle of Port Republic, along with the previous day's battle of Cross Keys, were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign. These victories forced the Union army to retreat, giving Jackson the freedom to reinforce General Robert E. Lee's army for the Seven Days Battles outside of Richmond, Virginia. The Northern Virginia Campaign, also known as the Second Bull Run Campaign or Second Manassas Campaign, was a series of battles that took place in Virginia during August and September of 1862. This was during the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War. Confederate General Robert E. Lee, following up on his successes in the Peninsula Campaign, moved his troops north toward Washington, D.C. and defeated Major General John Pope and his Army of Virginia in battle. The Battle of Malvern Hill, also known as the Battle of Poindexter's Farm, took place on July 1, 1862, during the American Civil War. This was the final battle of the Seven Days Battles, which happened near the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia. The battle was between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by General Robert E. Lee, and the Union Army of the Potomac, led by Major General George B. McClellan. More than 50,000 soldiers from each side fought, using over 200 pieces of artillery and three warships. The battle took place on a 130-foot elevation of land called Malvern Hill, which is near the James River."}], "output": "  The Seven Days Battles were fought earlier in our nation's history than the Battle of Manila during World War II.

Block Ave. It's one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas and has been around since 1950. Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar when she was just 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents. She paid them back within a year. In 1960, she tore down the old wooden building and replaced it with a long, narrow brick structure. The new building had only one window, which was the minimum size allowed by building codes at the time. This was likely a business decision to prevent break-ins. Miller was known for her shrewd business tactics, such as keeping a private club behind the bar, only having a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees to attract customers. The bar had a unique charm, with a 50-foot long bar that dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box playing 45s, and a deer head decorated with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses, and a tie. Miller ran the bar for 50 years until her health started to decline in 2000. She passed away at age 82 in May 2006, and the bar caught fire a month later.

It was written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. In the scene where Uncle Albert sings the song, he and Bert start floating up towards the ceiling because they're so happy. Mary Poppins eventually joins in and starts floating too. The idea of the scene is that laughter can make people feel light and happy, like they're floating on air. It's similar to how Peter Pan's flight power works, too. If someone's thinking about something sad, they'll come back down to earth. The song is saying that laughter is really important and can make people feel good, even if Mary Poppins doesn't always approve of Uncle Albert's wild behavior. The infectious mood even makes the Banks children and Bert start floating too! In the movie Mary Poppins, there is a song called Step In Time that is composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The dance choreography for this song was done by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood. The song is sung by Bert, a chimney sweep played by Dick Van Dyke, and the other chimney sweeps while they are working on the rooftops of London. In the first part of the song, Bert sings lines like Kick your knees up, round the chimney / Flap like a birdie, up on the railing / Over the rooftops and link your elbows. An interlude follows, with Bert, Mary Poppins, Michael, Jane, and all the chimney sweepers dancing around the rooftops. Admiral Boom watches them with a telescope and thinks they're Hottentots, so he orders the chimney sweepers to scram with colorful fireworks. In the second part of the song, the chimney sweepers enter the home of George Banks and Mrs. Brill comes in, screaming They're at it again! and trying to hit one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan. The song ends with Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins, and Bert in the same place, with Ellen running around the dining room and the chimney sweepers flipping her. The other phrases in the song are Votes for women, It's the master, and What's all this? The song My Kind of Town (Chicago Is) was written by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn and became popular due to its inclusion in the 1964 musical film Robin and the 7 Hoods, which starred members of the Rat Pack. The song was nominated for two prestigious awards: the Academy Award for Best Original Song and the Grammy Award for Best Original Score Written for a Motion Picture. However, it lost both awards to other songs from the same year: Chim Chim Cher-ee from Mary Poppins won the Academy Award, and the Mary Poppins score won the Grammy Award in the newly created category of Best Original Song for a Motion Picture. Despite these losses, the song remains a beloved classic. The song A Man Has Dreams from the Disney movie Mary Poppins was written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman. The melody is a slower version of The Life I Lead, which was used as George Banks's theme song when he was fired. In the movie and stage musical, Bert (played by Dick Van Dyke) and George Banks (played by David Tomlinson) sing the song as a duet in a conversational style. Unusually for a musical of that time, the song is operatic in style and features reprised elements of A Spoonful of Sugar, which is Mary Poppins's own theme song. Mary Poppins Opens the Door is a popular children's fantasy novel written by P.L. Travers, a British-Australian author. It's the third book in the Mary Poppins series, which follows the magical adventures of the beloved English nanny Mary Poppins. The novel was published in 1943 by Harcourt, Brace & World, Inc. and features beautiful illustrations by Mary Shepard and Agnes Sims. Mary Poppins Returns is an upcoming musical fantasy movie that's a sequel to the 1964 film Mary Poppins. The movie is directed by Rob Marshall and written by David Magee. It stars Emily Blunt, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer, Pixie Davies, Joel Dawson, Nathanael Saleh, Julie Walters, Colin Firth, Dick Van Dyke, and Meryl Streep. The movie takes place 25 years after the first film and follows Mary Poppins, the former nanny of Jane and Michael Banks, as she returns to their lives after a family tragedy. The movie is scheduled to be released on December 25, 2018, which is quite a long time after the original film was released. Mary Poppins is a 1964 American musical-fantasy movie directed by Robert Stevenson and produced by Walt Disney. The movie features songs written and composed by the Sherman Brothers, and the screenplay is based on P.L. Travers' book series. The film combines live-action and animation and stars Julie Andrews as Mary Poppins, who visits a family in London and uses her unique style to improve their lives. Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, and Glynis Johns play supporting roles. The movie was filmed entirely at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California, using painted background scenes to create the illusion of London. Mary Poppins is a song from the 2015 stage musical Love Birds. It's sung by a group of penguin barbershop quartet called The Original Quack Pack, who look like the penguins from the 1964 Walt Disney movie Mary Poppins. In the lead-up to the song, the penguins explain that they knew Mary Poppins, but they're not the same penguins from the movie. The song expresses their longing for the magical nanny who became famous in literature."}], "output": "  The song \"Chim Chim Cher-ee\" can be heard in the Mary Poppins scene of a Disney ride that debuted in 1964."},

Lowy, born on October 22, 1930, is an Australian-Israeli businessman who serves as the Chairman of Westfield Corporation, a global shopping center company with assets under management worth US$29.3 billion in the United States, United Kingdom, and Europe. He has also served as the former Chairman of Scentre Group, the owner and manager of Westfield-branded shopping centers in Australia and New Zealand. Australia tried to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but unfortunately, their bid was unsuccessful. On December 2, 2010, FIFA announced that the event would actually be held in Qatar instead. Australia had also submitted a bid for the 2018 World Cup, but they withdrew it on June 10, 2010. The 2018 and 2022 World Cups are the 21st and 22nd editions of the FIFA World Cup, and the bidding process began in January 2009. National associations had until February 2, 2009, to express their interest in hosting the event. The bid was presented by Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley, Quentin Bryce, and Elle Macpherson, but due to controversies surrounding Qatar's hosting, there is a possibility that Australia could still host the 2022 World Cup if FIFA decides to strip Qatar of their rights.The 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was a proposal by Qatar to host the global soccer tournament. However, the bid has faced scrutiny from the FBI due to allegations of bribery and corruption. As a result, the FIFA President, Sepp Blatter, has resigned. Notably, Qatar will be the first Arab country to host the World Cup, with a population of just 2 million people. Russia announced its intention to bid for the FIFA World Cup in early 2009 and submitted its request to FIFA on time. Russia's President, Vladimir Putin, showed great interest in the bid and instructed the Minister of Sports, Vitaly Mutko, to prepare a bid for Russia to host the 2018 World Cup. According to a report submitted by Mutko, who was also the President of the Russian Football Union (RFU) at the time, Russia was ready to spend around $10 billion on the tournament. The bid committee also included RFU CEO Alexey Sorokin and Alexander Djordjadze, who served as the Director of Bid Planning and Operations. In October 2010, Russia unexpectedly withdrew its bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. However, on December 2, 2010, Russia was officially chosen as the host country for the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The Indonesia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the first time the Football Association of Indonesia (PSSI) officially applied to host the FIFA World Cup. However, FIFA rejected their bid on March 19, 2010 due to a lack of government support. Indonesia was one of four countries in Asia competing to hold the tournament for the second time, following the 2002 event in Japan and South Korea. Interestingly, Indonesia, then known as the Dutch East Indies, was the first Asian country to participate in the World Cup when they competed in 1938, losing to Hungary in the first round. The Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the second time the Japan Football Association (JFA) had officially bid for the tournament. If they had been successful, Japan would have hosted their second World Cup Finals, and it would have been the first time they hosted alone since they shared the 2002 FIFA World Cup with South Korea. This would have made Japan the sixth country to host the tournament twice, after Italy, France, Mexico, Brazil, and Germany. The JFA decided to focus solely on the 2022 World Cup bid on May 4, 2010. The bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups was how FIFA chose the locations for these events. This process started in March 2009 and lasted until November 2010. In total, FIFA received 11 bids from 13 countries, but one of these bids was withdrawn and another was rejected before the FIFA executive committee voted. Of the remaining bids, two applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applied for both events. During the bidding process, all non-European bids for the 2018 World Cup were withdrawn, which meant that all European bids were not considered for the 2022 World Cup. The bids for the 2018 World Cup included England, Russia, a joint bid from Belgium and the Netherlands, and a joint bid from Portugal and Spain. The bids for the 2022 World Cup came from Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States. Unfortunately, Indonesia's bid was disqualified due to a lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid due to financial reasons. The Korea 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was the second time the Korea Football Association (KFA) had officially bid for the tournament. If the bid was successful, South Korea would have hosted their second World Cup Finals and first solo event since they shared the 2002 FIFA World Cup with Japan. Despite some recent tensions between the two countries, Han Sung-joo, the chairman of the bid committee, expressed a desire to involve North Korea in the event if South Korea were to win the bid. The United States Soccer Federation wanted to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, so they submitted a bid. In February 2007, U.S. Soccer said they would try to host the 2018 World Cup, but then in January 2009, they announced they would also bid for the 2022 Cup. However, in October 2010, they decided to focus on winning the 2022 Cup instead of the 2018 one, and on December 2, 2010, it was announced that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup. Former US President Bill Clinton said that the people in charge of the FIFA (the organization that runs the World Cup) were in the mood to give the tournament to countries that didn't have it before, and they wanted to make soccer a popular sport around the world. Morocco is trying to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. They are competing with a group from North America, which includes Canada, Mexico, and the United States, to host the tournament. Morocco announced on August 11, 2017 that they would submit their bid to host the World Cup."}], "output": "  Frank P. Lowy was born on October 22, 1930. **"},

He was also a founder of the Nash Ensemble and has worked with other early music ensembles. In addition to his performance career, Slatford is also a publisher of sheet music for double bass players. He studied music with Adrian Beers and wrote an obituary for Beers in The Independent.   In simple terms, a walkdown in country music is a bassline that connects two chords that are three notes apart. This is often done by playing an inverted chord (a chord played upside down) between the root notes of the first two chords. For example, if you start with the chords G Major and E minor, you can play a walkdown by going from G to D/F♯ (an inverted chord) followed by Em. This creates a smooth, stepwise motion in the bassline. Walkdowns can be played by any instrument in a country band, including the upright bass, electric bass, guitar, or piano. Dave Meros was born on February 8, 1956, in Salinas, California. He is a well-known bass guitar player and is best recognized for his work with the progressive rock band Spock's Beard.

His fast and impressive slapping style can be heard online. Winnebago Deal is a rock band from Oxford, UK, formed in the late 1990s. The band started when Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (formerly on guitar) began writing songs together at Bartholomew School in Eynsham. They then recruited a drummer and bass player through an ad and played their first gig in early 1999. However, the band members weren't happy with their bass player, so they let him go and Ben Thomas switched from guitar to bass. By the summer of 2000, the band's drummer had left, and Thomas switched back to drums so the band could continue as a two-piece. Today, Winnebago Deal consists of just two Bens - Ben Perrier (vocals, guitar) and Ben Thomas (drums). Zachary Throne is an American actor and musician who has had a successful career in both fields.

The movie is based on a true story that took place in 1987 in McFarland, California, where a mainly Latino high school team won a state championship under the coaching of Jim White, played by Kevin Costner. The movie also stars Maria Bello and Morgan Saylor. The film was produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Mayhem Pictures. Dinosaur is a 2000 animated movie produced by Disney and a company called The Secret Lab. It's the 39th movie in the Disney animated series and the first to use computer animation. However, it's not considered one of the classic Disney animated movies in the UK, where another movie called The Wild (2006) is included in the group instead.Cinizasaurus is an informal name used for fossilized remains found in New Mexico during the Late Triassic period, which were initially thought to belong to a theropod dinosaur. These remains, NMMNH P-18400, include a tibia, vertebrae, and other fragments, and came from a layer of rock known as the Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation, near Fort Wingate. In an unpublished thesis by Andrew Heckert, the name Cinizasaurus hunti was proposed for the specimen, but it was never officially adopted and was first mentioned in scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Triassic fossils from North America that were thought to belong to dinosaurs. In this redescription, the authors could only classify the material as belonging to a group of ancient creatures known as Archosauriformes. Sphaerotholus is a type of dinosaur called a pachycephalosaurid, which lived during the Upper Cretaceous period in the western United States and Canada. So far, three species of Sphaerotholus have been discovered: S. goodwini from New Mexico, S. buchholtzae from Montana, and S. edmontonense from Alberta. The name Sphaerotholus comes from the Greek words sphaira, meaning ball, and tholos, meaning dome, which refers to the distinctive dome-shaped skull of these dinosaurs. It's interesting that Sphaerotholus lived from the Campanian period in New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian period in Montana, which means it survived for about 7-8 million years. When it was first discovered in 2002, the scientists who described the genus said that Sphaerotholus is different from other pachycephalosaurids in that it has a special bone on its skull called a parietosquamosal bar that gets smaller as you look at it from the side, and it's surrounded by a single row of bumps and one bump on the side. Because of these unique features, Sphaerotholus is considered a very specialized or derived pachycephalosaurid. Oryctodromeus was a small dinosaur called an ornithopod that lived around 95 million years ago during the Cenomanian stage of the Cretaceous period in Montana and Idaho. Its name means digging runner, which suggests that it was good at moving quickly and digging holes. Scientists have found fossils of Oryctodromeus in these areas, which are part of a formation called the Blackleaf Formation in Montana and the Wayan Formation in Idaho. Oryctodromeus was a member of a family of small, fast-moving herbivores called Thescelosauridae, and it is the first dinosaur known to have evidence of burrowing behavior, which means it probably lived in underground burrows. The name Cryptoraptor means secret thief and refers to fossilized remains found in New Mexico during the Late Triassic period. These remains, NMMNH P-17375, consist of a few scattered bones like vertebrae, a pubic bone, and parts of the thigh bones. They were discovered in the Bull Canyon Formation in Quay County, which is located in New Mexico and dates back to the Norian age of the Triassic period. A scientist named Adrian Hunt first suggested the name Cryptoraptor for these remains, but the name was never officially adopted. In 2007, three scientists (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker) re-examined the remains and could only identify them as belonging to a group of animals called Archosaurs, which includes both dinosaurs and their ancestors. Comanchesaurus is a name used for fossil remains found in New Mexico that were initially thought to belong to a theropod dinosaur. These remains, known as NMMNH P-4569, consist of partial skeleton pieces, including vertebrae and hind limb bones, and come from the Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation in Guadalupe County. In the past, a scientist named Adrian Hunt proposed the name Comanchesaurus kuesi for the specimen, but this name was never officially adopted and was first mentioned in a scientific paper in 2007. In this paper, three scientists reexamined the material and determined that it actually belonged to an unknown type of saurischian, rather than a dinosaur. Mark Thomas Ciardi was born on August 19, 1961, and is an American film producer and former professional baseball pitcher. He is the founder and CEO of Apex Entertainment, an independent content production company that also serves as a financier for media properties. Prior to Apex, Ciardi co-founded Mayhem Pictures, which had a twelve-year overall first-look deal with Walt Disney Studios. During his time at Mayhem, he produced several successful films, including The Rookie, Miracle, Invincible, The Game Plan, Secretariat, and Million Dollar Arm, as well as the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary Big Shot. Upcoming releases include the best-selling novel Fallen. Fruitadens is a type of dinosaur called a heterodontosaurid, which lived during the Late Jurassic period, around 150 million years ago. The name Fruitadens means Fruita tooth because the first fossils of this dinosaur were found in Fruita, Colorado (in the United States). Scientists have discovered partial skulls and skeletons from at least four different individuals of Fruitadens, and they believe that these individuals were of different ages. Fruitadens is the smallest known dinosaur of its kind, with young adults estimated to be around 65 centimeters (25 inches) long and weighing around 0.5 kilograms (1.1 pounds). Based on their discoveries, scientists think that Fruitadens was an omnivore (meaning it ate both plants and animals) and was one of the last heterodontosaurids to exist. Dakotadon is a type of dinosaur called an iguanodont that lived during the Lower Cretaceous period, around 120 million years ago. It was discovered in South Dakota, USA, and is known from a partial skull. The first description of Dakotadon was in 1989 by scientists David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork, who originally called it Iguanodon lakotaensis. However, there has been some debate among scientists about where Dakotadon fits in the evolutionary tree of iguanodonts. Some researchers think it might be more closely related to a different species called Theiophytalia, while others believe it is the same as Iguanodon bernissartensis. In 2008, the paleontologist Gregory S. Paul created a new genus, Dakotadon, to categorize this species separately from Iguanodon bernissartensis."}], "output": "  Dinosaur came out first, in 2000.

This was the 58th time the country had held a presidential election every four years. The election was held on November 8, 2016, and it was a big surprise when the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, and his running mate Mike Pence won. They defeated the Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine. Trump became the 45th President of the United States, and Pence became the 48th Vice President. Along with the presidential election, there were other important elections held on the same day, including elections for the Senate, House of Representatives, and governor positions in various states. In 2016, the Michigan Democratic primary was held on March 8th as part of the Democratic Party's presidential primaries leading up to the general election. This primary took place in the US state of Michigan.In 1976, the United States held its 48th presidential election on Tuesday, November 2nd. The election was won by Jimmy Carter, a little-known governor from Georgia, who unexpectedly defeated the incumbent President Gerald Ford, who was from Michigan. Carter's running mate was Walter Mondale, a U.S. senator from Minnesota. The election was a surprise because Carter was not one of the front-runners, but he ultimately emerged victorious over Ford and his running mate, Bob Dole, a senator from Kansas, who were the Republican candidates. The 2012 presidential election in the United States was held on November 6, 2012. This was the 57th presidential election in the country's history. The incumbent president, Barack Obama, ran for re-election and won, defeating his opponent, Mitt Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts. Obama's running mate, Joe Biden, also won the election. This means that Obama and Biden will serve another four-year term as president and vice president of the United States. The 2044 United States presidential election will take place on Tuesday, November 8, 2044. This will be the 65th presidential election in the US, in which voters will choose presidential electors who will either elect a new president and vice president through the electoral college or re-elect the current incumbents. The process of selecting the presidential nominees will begin in the first six months of 2044, through a series of primary elections and caucuses. In this process, voters will cast ballots to choose a group of delegates who will then officially elect their party's presidential nominee at a political party convention. The 2020 United States presidential election, taking place on Tuesday, November 3rd, 2020, will be the 59th quadrennial presidential election in the country's history. Voters will choose presidential electors who will then either elect a new president and vice president through the electoral college or re-elect the current incumbents. The process of selecting these electors will take place through a series of primary elections and caucuses held in the first six months of 2020. This process is indirect, meaning that voters cast ballots for a group of delegates representing their preferred political party, and these delegates then choose their party's nominee at a convention. The 1968 presidential election in the United States was the 46th quadrennial election held on November 5, 1968. The race was between former Vice President Richard Nixon, the Republican nominee, and incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic nominee. Analysts believe that this election was a significant turning point in American politics because it marked the end of the New Deal Coalition, which had been the dominant force in presidential politics for 36 years. In 1960, the 44th presidential election in the United States took place on November 8th. The incumbent President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, couldn't run for re-election since he had reached the limit of two terms allowed by the 22nd Amendment. The Republican Party chose Vice President Richard Nixon as their candidate, while the Democratic Party selected John F. Kennedy, a U.S. Senator from Massachusetts. This election was historic because it was the first time that residents in Alaska and Hawaii were able to participate, as both states had become part of the Union in 1959. In 1964, the 45th presidential election in the United States took place on November 3. Incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson, who had become president after John F. Kennedy's assassination just a year earlier, ran for re-election as a Democrat. Johnson won a landslide victory, receiving an impressive 61.1% of the popular vote, the highest percentage for a candidate since James Monroe's re-election in 1820. This election was the most one-sided in terms of popular votes in US history, and the tenth most lopsided in terms of electoral votes. No candidate has since achieved a higher percentage of the popular vote, and only a few have won by a larger electoral vote margin, including Abraham Lincoln in 1864, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, Richard Nixon in 1972, and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984. In 1892, the United States held its 27th presidential election, which was a rematch of the closely contested election four years earlier.

Some people believe he is the same person as the legendary British king Guiderius. The Catuvellauni were a Celtic tribe or state located in southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest. We know about them through inscriptions that date back to the 4th century.The Romano-British culture emerged in Britain after the Roman Empire conquered the region in AD 43 and established the province of Britannia. This culture blended the Roman and indigenous Briton cultures, with the Britons being a Celtic-speaking people. Despite the Roman legions leaving Britain in AD 410, the Romano-British culture survived for several centuries, until AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived. During this time, the southern part of Britain maintained a subtle form of Roman culture, using everyday Latin in their writing. The history of Wales begins thousands of years ago, when the first humans arrived in the region. Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales at least 230,000 years ago, while modern humans arrived around 31,000 BC. People continued to live in Wales continuously from the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and the region has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, the region was controlled by the Celtic Britons and their language. The Romans conquered Wales in AD 43 and ruled the area until the 5th century, when they left and allowed the Anglo-Saxons to invade. After the Romans departed, the Brittonic language and culture began to split into different groups, and the Welsh people became one of the largest of these groups. They are often discussed separately from the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples from the 11th century onwards. The Durotriges were one of the Celtic tribes living in Britain before the Roman invasion. They lived in the modern-day counties of Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, and Devon, east of the River Axe. In 2009, an Iron Age hoard was discovered on the Isle of Wight, which suggests that the Durotriges also lived in the western half of the island. After the Roman conquest, the Durotriges' main settlements, called civitates, or administrative centers, were Durnovaria (modern-day Dorchester) and Lindinis (modern-day Ilchester). The Durotriges' territory was bordered to the west by the Dumnonii tribe and to the east by the Belgae tribe. The Corieltauvi were an ancient tribe of people who lived in Britain before and during the Roman occupation. They were located in the English East Midlands, and their territory was bordered by several other tribes, including the Brigantes to the north, the Cornovii to the west, the Dobunni and Catuvellauni to the south, and the Iceni to the east. The Corieltauvi had their capital city, called Ratae Corieltauvorum, which is now known as Leicester. In the year 43 AD (which was also known as XLIII in the Julian calendar), Tuesday was the first day of the year. This was during the time when Julius Caesar and Vitellius were consuls (or leaders) of Rome. The term AD 43 was first used in the early Middle Ages to refer to this year, as the Anno Domini (AD) calendar era became more widely used in Europe for naming years. The Roman conquest of Britain began in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, with General Aulus Plautius serving as the first governor of Roman Britain (known as Britannia). The Romans had previously tried to invade Britain several times, both during the Roman Republic and Empire. Britain had established diplomatic and trading ties with the Romans in the century leading up to the conquest, particularly in the south, where Roman economic and cultural influence was significant. The Sussex chicken is a popular breed of chicken that originated in England around the time of the Roman invasion of Britain in AD 43. It is a dual-purpose breed, meaning it is suitable for both egg production and meat production. There are eight standard colors of Sussex chickens, with a few additional colors being developed. Additionally, there is a bantam version of the breed, which is smaller in size and can be any of the eight standard colors. England was first inhabited over 800,000 years ago, as evidenced by flint tools and footprints found at Happisburgh in Norfolk. The oldest evidence of early modern humans in North West Europe was discovered in Devon at Kents Cavern in 1927, and was re-dated to between 41,000 and 44,000 years old in 2011. Humans have continuously lived in England since around 13,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age. The region has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age, such as Stonehenge and Avebury. In the Iron Age, England, along with the rest of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was inhabited by the Celtic people known as the Britons, including some Belgic tribes like the Atrebates, Catuvellauni, and Trinovantes in the south east. In AD 43, the Roman conquest of Britain began, and the Romans ruled their province of Britannia until the early 5th century."}], "output": "  The Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 ruled southeastern Britain prior to the conquest by the Roman Empire.

LaValle was born in Brooklyn, New York on May 22, 1939. He represents District 1 in the New York State Senate, which includes five towns on the East End of Long Island and the eastern half of the Town of Brookhaven, New York. LaValle was first elected in 1976 and is currently the chair of the Higher Education Committee in the State Senate. New York has 62 State Senate districts, and one of these districts is the 1st district. The 1st district is currently represented by a senator named Kenneth LaValle, who is a member of the Republican party.New York's 2nd State Senate district is one of 62 districts in the New York State Senate. The district is currently represented by John J. Flanagan (R), who is not only the representative of the district but also the Majority Leader and Temporary President of the New York State Senate. Nesting is a process of dividing a larger area into smaller voting districts for the purpose of electing representatives to a different government body. For example, in California, the State Assembly (the lower house) has 80 members, each representing a fraction of California's population, while the State Senate (the upper house) has 40 members, each representing a different fraction of the population. The nesting process involves defining the voting districts for the State Assembly first, and then dividing those districts into smaller areas to create the State Senate districts. Alternatively, the State Senate districts can be defined first, and then the Assembly districts can be created by splitting each Senate district into two. If the districts are created separately, without nesting, then the process is simpler. The California State Senate is the upper house of California's legislature. Because California has a large population and a relatively small number of state legislators, each senator represents a larger number of people than representatives in the US House of Representatives. In fact, each senator represents more than 931,000 people, which is roughly the same as the population of the state of Delaware. There are 40 senators in total, and they are limited to serving two four-year terms (eight years) in office. However, if they were elected before 2012, they are limited to two four-year terms, while those elected in or after 2012 can serve up to 12 years in the legislature in any combination of four-year state senate or two-year state assembly terms.

Prior to his election to the state senate, Bradford served in the California State Assembly for the 62nd district. He was first elected to represent the 51st district in a special election held on September 1, 2009, after Curren Price resigned his seat to take a seat in the California State Senate.

Frisian speakers in South Jutland (modern-day Northern Friesland) also used Old Frisian, but there are no medieval texts from this region. The language of the earlier inhabitants of the area between the Zuiderzee and Ems River, mentioned by the Roman historian Tacitus, is known only through a few personal names and place-names. Old Frisian evolved into Middle Frisian, which was spoken from the 16th to the 19th century. The Leda is a river in northwestern Germany, specifically in the state of Lower Saxony. It flows into the Ems River near the town of Leer. The Leda originates from the confluence of two rivers, the Sagter Ems and the Soeste (Dreyschloot), located near the town of Barßel. The river is about 29 kilometers long, and the last 1.9 kilometers are navigable for large ships. The settlement of Kloster Muhde, located on the southern bank of the Leda, is situated opposite Leer. The word Muhde comes from the Old Frisian language and means river mouth.German (also known as Deutsch) is a language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe. It's the main language spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (in Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein. In fact, it's one of the two official languages of Luxembourg too. German is closely related to other West Germanic languages like Afrikaans, Dutch, English, Frisian, Low German/Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. Of all these languages, German is the second most widely spoken after English. English is a language that originated in medieval England and has since become a widely spoken language around the world. It gets its name from the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England. Although it is related to other Germanic languages like Frisian, English has been heavily influenced by other languages, including Norse (a North Germanic language), Latin, and Romance languages like French. Proto-Norse, also known as Proto-Scandinavian or Ancient Nordic, was an Indo-European language spoken in Scandinavia around 2,000 years ago. It is believed to have evolved from a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic, which is the ancestor of all North Germanic languages, including Old Norse, Swedish, and Danish. Proto-Norse is the earliest stage of a North Germanic language and the language attested in the oldest Scandinavian Elder Futhark inscriptions, which date back to the 2nd to 8th centuries CE (corresponding to the late Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age). Over time, Proto-Norse evolved into the dialects of Old Norse, which later developed into the modern North Germanic languages spoken today. Dutch is a West Germanic language spoken by around 24 million people as their first language, including the majority of the population of the Netherlands and about 60% of Belgium. Additionally, another 5 million people speak Dutch as a second language. Dutch is the third most widely spoken Germanic language, after English and German. Afrikaans is a language spoken in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, and Zimbabwe. It originated from the Dutch language spoken by Dutch settlers in what is now South Africa, and developed its own unique characteristics over time, becoming a distinct language. Afrikaans was previously known as Cape Dutch or kitchen Dutch, but is now commonly referred to as Afrikaans. It is a creole or partially creolized language, meaning that it has elements of both Dutch and other languages. Afrikaans is the first language of many Afrikaners and Coloureds in Southern Africa. Leer is a town located in the district of Leer, which is situated in the northwestern part of Lower Saxony, Germany. It is situated near the border with the Netherlands and is nestled along the river Leda, a tributary of the river Ems.

The road over the dam is open for hikers, but not for cars, and it provides a possible route into the northern parts of Sarek National Park without the need for a boat. Old Saxon, also known as Old Low German, was an ancient Germanic language that was spoken in several regions, including Northern Germany, the northeastern Netherlands, southern Denmark, the Americas, and parts of Eastern Europe. It is closely related to the Anglo-Frisian languages, such as Old English and Old Frisian. The language was first documented in the 8th century and continued to be used until the 12th century, when it evolved into Middle Low German. It was primarily spoken in the coastal regions of modern northwestern Germany and the eastern Netherlands by a Germanic tribe called the Saxons. One unique feature of Old Saxon is that it shares some similarities with the Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law, which is also found in Old Frisian and Old English, but not in languages like Dutch, Luxembourgish, and German."}], "output": "  The Western Germanic language spoken from which the small settlement situated on the river Leda opposite Leer derives its name is Old Frisian."},

Harrison wrote the song in 1967, while he was still a member of the Beatles, in response to the public reaction to Paul McCartney's announcement that he had taken the drug LSD. This news caused a similar reaction in the media as John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity in 1966. The song's lyrics encourage self-awareness and careful consideration of one's actions, while the music features unusual time signature changes from the standard 4/4 beat to 9/8. The song's lyrics also reflect the era in which it was written by revisiting themes first introduced in Beatles songs like Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love. George Harrison wrote the song Within You Without You for the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. This was Harrison's second song written in the Indian classical style, after Love You To. He was inspired to write the song after spending six weeks in India with his sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, in September and October of 1966. The song features Indian instruments like the sitar, dilruba, and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle. The recording was different from the Beatles' usual work because it had a spiritual and introspective feel to it, reflecting Harrison's interest in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas. Although Harrison was the only Beatle to contribute a composition to the album, his support for Indian culture is evident in the inclusion of Indian spiritual leaders like Paramahansa Yogananda on the album cover.Love Songs: A Compilation... Old and New is an album by English musician Phil Collins, released by Atlantic Recording Corporation and Rhino Entertainment on September 28, 2004. This album came out just a few months after the box set The Platinum Collection, which was released earlier in the year (in 2004). Sharon Gannon was born on July 4, 1951, in Washington, D.C. She is a yoga teacher, animal rights activist, musician, author, dancer, and painter. Along with David Life, she co-founded the Jivamukti Yoga Method, which popularized yoga in the West in the late 20th century. Jivamukti Yoga teaches that compassion for all living beings is essential for spiritual growth. Students are encouraged to adopt a vegan diet to minimize harm to the environment and other living beings. The method also emphasizes the concept of shunyata, or the idea that everything we experience is created by our perception of it. This means that by changing our perspective, we can change ourselves and the world around us. According to Gannon, how we treat others determines how they treat us, and how we see ourselves determines who we are. Syd Barrett, a talented English musician, recorded many songs during his time as a musician. He was one of the founding members of the rock band Pink Floyd and played a crucial role in shaping their early sound. Barrett wrote most of the material on their first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and contributed to their second album, A Saucerful of Secrets. However, due to his mental health issues, Barrett was replaced by guitarist David Gilmour in April 1968. After leaving Pink Floyd, Barrett released two solo albums in 1970 before retiring from the music industry in 1972. David Bowie released an EP called No Plan on January 8, 2017, which would have been his 70th birthday. The EP features songs he wrote and recorded before his death, including Lazarus, No Plan, Killing a Little Time, and When I Met You. These songs were originally recorded by the cast of Bowie's Broadway musical, Lazarus, and were later included on No Plan. The EP was released almost a year after Bowie's death and debuted at #138 on the Billboard 200 chart. To promote the EP, a music video for the title track was also released, directed by Tom Hingston. Billy Bragg released a three-track single called We Laughed as part of the Rosetta Life project in 2005. The single peaked at number 11 in the UK and number 38 in Ireland in 2006. To create the single, Bragg worked with three patients from Trimar Hospice in Weymouth, who wrote lyrics about their experiences with illness and their emotions. The songs were produced by English guitarist Robbie McIntosh. George Harrison's song Who Can See It was released on his album Living in the Material World in 1973, three years after the Beatles' break-up. The lyrics of the song express Harrison's feelings of unease about the expectations placed on him following the Beatles' unprecedented popularity. Some music critics and biographers believe that Harrison wrote the song during a difficult time in his life, following his success as a solo artist with the triple album All Things Must Pass and his humanitarian work in Bangladesh. The lyrics of Who Can See It are thought to be a reflection of Harrison's desire for independence from the Beatles' legacy. The song has been compared to John Lennon's Plastic Ono Band, which was also inspired by Lennon's personal struggles and therapy. Charlotte Gainsbourg, a French musician and actress, released her second album, titled 5:55, in 2007. This was her first album release in 20 years. She worked with several talented musicians on the album, including the French duo Air, English musician Jarvis Cocker, Irish singer-songwriter Neil Hannon, and Nigel Godrich, who is best known for his work with Radiohead. Two songs from the album, The Songs That We Sing and 5:55, were released as singles. The album was a hit in France, selling over 500,000 copies and earning a platinum certification. However, it didn't do as well in the United States, selling only 22,000 copies. Despite this, The Songs That We Sing was ranked #78 on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007.

After Oasis broke up in August 2009, Archer started working with other former members of the band, including Liam Gallagher, to form Beady Eye. The band released two albums, Different Gear, Still Speeding in 2011 and BE in 2013, before disbanding in October 2014. In 2017, Archer joined Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds as lead guitarist, reuniting with his former Oasis bandmate Noel Gallagher."}], "output": "  The English musician who wrote the songs \"See Yourself\" and \"Within You Without You\" is George Harrison."},

The Stanley Cup is a trophy awarded each year to the champion team of the National Hockey League (NHL). It was donated by Lord Stanley of Preston in 1892 and is the oldest professional sports trophy in North America. Initially, the trophy was awarded to Canada's amateur ice hockey clubs through challenge games and league play. However, professional clubs began to dominate the competition in the early 1900s, and in 1913, the two major professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), agreed to let their champions play each other in an annual series for the Stanley Cup. After several league mergers and folds, the Cup became the official championship trophy of the NHL in 1926, although it was still technically subject to challenge from other teams.

This series is significant because it featured early performances by some very talented actors, including Audrey Hepburn, James Dean, and Grace Kelly. These actors were just starting their careers at the time, and their appearances on the show helped launch their fame.

In 1994, Lou Arkoff, the son of film producer Samuel Z. Arkoff, created and produced a TV series called Rebel Highway for the Showtime channel. The show was a revival of the classic B-movies from the 1950s, but with a modern twist. Arkoff wanted to see what it would be like to remake these old movies for a new generation, so he gave each director a free hand to create their own version with a modern edge. The directors were given a budget of $1.3 million and 12 days to shoot their films, with the freedom to choose their own cast and creative team. Arkoff wanted the show to be fun for both younger and older audiences, so he encouraged the directors to pay close attention to the details of the era while also adding their own modern spin. The result was a series of 10 entertaining and nostalgic films that celebrated the spirit of rebellion and creativity.

Born in Iceland and living in Canada, Jon follows three Icelandic-Canadians as they embark on a journey to discover their Icelandic heritage by traveling to Iceland. Along with their experiences in Iceland, Jon also captures their reactions when they return to Canada and attend the Islendingadagurinn festival in Gimli, which celebrates Icelandic culture.

Each time, von Trier would give Leth a different obstacle or challenge to make the task harder. This is all done as a way for von Trier to pay tribute to his favorite film and to see how Leth would handle the challenge.A film laboratory is a business that provides services to the movie industry.

The PFSh held power until 1943, when Italy surrendered to the Allies. After Italy's defeat, Albania was occupied by Germany, and the PFSh was replaced by a new group called the Guard of Greater Albania. Tefik Selim Mborja was an important figure in Albanian politics during the early 20th century. He served as the leader of the Albanian Fascist Party during World War II. This party was a political organization that believed in fascist ideology, which emphasized nationalism, authoritarianism, and suppression of political opposition. As the general secretary of the party, Mborja played a significant role in shaping the party's policies and actions during this time.In September 1982, Sweden held general elections. The results saw the return of the Swedish Social Democratic Party to power after six years in the opposition. This was the longest period the Social Democrats had been in opposition since the early 1900s. The center-right coalition, led by Thorbjörn Fälldin, had lost power the year before the election when one of its parties, the Moderate Party, withdrew from the government in protest of the centrist tax policies of the Fälldin government. After the Social Democrats regained power, their leader, Olof Palme, was successfully re-elected as Prime Minister. Palme had previously held the position from 1969 to 1976 and went on to retain it until his assassination in 1986. Bal'arab bin Himyar (died 1749) was one of the leaders during the civil wars in Oman towards the end of the Yaruba dynasty. He was chosen as Imam in 1728 and held power in the interior of Oman while his cousin, Saif bin Sultan II, controlled the coast. However, in 1737, he gave up his claim after being defeated by Saif's Persian allies. He was later chosen as Imam again in 1743 during another Persian invasion, and once more held power in the interior while Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi was recognized as the ruler by the coastal people. Unfortunately, he died in battle against Ahmad bin Said in 1749, and Ahmad became the undisputed ruler of the country. The Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) is the largest labor union in Mexico. For a long time, the CTM was a powerful ally of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled Mexico for over 70 years. However, starting in the 1980s, the CTM's influence within the PRI began to decline as technocrats took control of the party. By the time the PRI lost the 2000 general election, the CTM's influence in Mexican politics had significantly decreased. The United Bermuda Party (UBP) was a political party in Bermuda that existed from 1968 to 2011. It positioned itself as a centrist party with a moderate stance on social and fiscal issues. The UBP held power in Bermuda's House of Assembly continuously for 47 years, until it officially ceased operations on June 30, 2011, when most of its members joined the newly formed One Bermuda Alliance. On December 2, 1972, federal elections were held in Australia for the House of Representatives. The Australian Labor Party, led by Gough Whitlam, won the majority of seats, taking 67 out of 125.

Albania was a country in southeastern Europe that had a socialist government from 1946 to 1992. During this time, the government was known by different names, including the People's Republic of Albania and the Democratic Government of Albania. The country was led by a Stalinist-style government dominated by Enver Hoxha and the Party of Labour of Albania. Albania was known for having strict travel and visa restrictions, and in 1967, it declared itself the world's first atheist state. Despite being a member of the Warsaw Pact military alliance, Albania withdrew from the alliance in 1968 after the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia. In 1991, the country held its first multi-party elections, and in 1992, the socialist government was officially dissolved when a new constitution was adopted. In February 1967, the fourth legislative assembly election of Madras State (which later became Tamil Nadu) took place. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) coalition, led by C.N. Annadurai, won the election by defeating the Indian National Congress (Congress). The main issues that influenced the election were anti-Hindi agitations, the rising prices of essential goods, and a shortage of rice. The incumbent Congress government, led by K. Kamaraj, had weakened due to Kamaraj's resignation in 1963 to focus on party affairs and persistent rumors of corruption. This election marked the second time a non-Congress party had gained a majority in a state in India, and the last time the Congress held power in Tamil Nadu. The DMK formed a non-Congress government with an absolute majority, which signaled the beginning of Dravidian dominance in Tamil Nadu's politics. After Annadurai's death in 1969, V.R. Nedunchezhiyan took over as acting chief minister. The Hungarian Communist Party (HCP) was established on November 24, 1918, and ruled Hungary for a brief period from March to August 1919, led by Béla Kun and the Hungarian Soviet Republic. However, the communist government was overthrown by the Romanian Army and forced to go underground. After World War II, the party regained power and held it from 1945 under the leadership of Mátyás Rákosi. In 1948, the HCP merged with the Social Democrats to form the Hungarian Working People's Party. The Communist Party of Hungary was also a member of the Communist International, a global organization of communist parties."}], "output": "  Tefik Selim Mborja held power in Albania until 1943.**"},

They play in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and are part of the Pac-12 Conference. The team is commonly called the Ducks, but they were previously known as the Webfoots. The University of Oregon started playing football in 1894. The Ducks play their home games at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, which seats over 54,000 people. Their main rivals are the Oregon State Beavers and the Washington Huskies. At the end of each regular season, the Ducks and Beavers play each other in the Civil War rivalry game in November. Joe Walker, born on December 11, 1992, is an American football player who plays linebacker for the Philadelphia Eagles in the National Football League (NFL). He attended college at Oregon and played football there.The Civil War is the name of an annual college football game between the University of Oregon Ducks in Eugene and Oregon State University Beavers in Corvallis. This historic rivalry game has been played since 1894 and is the fifth most played college football rivalry game in the NCAA's Division I Football Bowl Subdivision. Both universities are members of the North Division of the Pac-12 Conference, making this game a fierce competition between two of the state's top universities. The Textile Bowl is an annual college football game between the Clemson Tigers and the NC State Wolfpack, two rival teams from North Carolina and South Carolina. The game has been played since 1981, and it's called the Textile Bowl because both universities are known for their textile programs, which are two of the largest in the world. The two teams are members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and they play in the ACC's Atlantic Division. The name Textile Bowl reflects the importance of the textile industry to the economies of their home states. The Rivalry is a classic American college football game played between the Lafayette Leopards and Lehigh Mountain Hawks teams of Lafayette College and Lehigh University, respectively. This is the longest and most-played football rivalry in the country, with 152 games played since 1884. The two schools are located just 17 miles apart in the Lehigh Valley of eastern Pennsylvania, and the rivalry extends beyond football to include meetings in all sports and other activities. The teams have played each other twice a year (except in 1891 when they played three games and 1896 when they didn't play at all) since 1901. In 1983, the Oregon State and Oregon football teams played each other in a big game at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon. This was the 87th time they had played each other, which is called the Civil War rivalry game. Unfortunately, the game ended in a tie with no one scoring any points. This is interesting because overtime wasn't allowed in college football games back then, and since overtime was added to Division I games in 1996, it's likely that this game was the last time a game ended in a tie without overtime. The LSU–Ole Miss football rivalry, now called the Magnolia Bowl, is an annual college football game between the LSU Tigers and Ole Miss Rebels. The teams compete for a trophy and have been playing each other since 1894. The rivalry was strong in the 1950s and 1960s, when both teams were highly ranked and claimed a national championship. However, the rivalry lost popularity in the 1970s and 1990s due to Ole Miss not being as successful. Despite this, the rivalry still creates excitement among fans in Oxford and Baton Rouge. The Battle of the Blue is an annual college football game between the University of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens and Villanova University Wildcats. The game has been played since 1895, with breaks in the 1960s and 1970s, and has been known as the Battle of the Blue since 2007. The winning team gets to keep the Battle of the Blue Trophy at their institution for a year and brings it to the next game. The trophy is a football with the logos of both teams on either side and the scores of each game are engraved on the base. Villanova had possession of the trophy for the first four years, but Delaware won it in 2011. The Army-Navy Game is a big college football rivalry in the United States between two military academies: the Army Black Knights at West Point, New York, and the Navy Midshipmen at Annapolis, Maryland. Both teams represent their service branches, which have a long history of working together in the military. The game is important because it marks the end of the college football season and is the final game of a series called the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, which also includes the Air Force Falcons near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The game has become a symbol of the rivalry between the different branches of the US military. The Battle for the Bell is a big football game played between two colleges in the United States: Marshall University and Ohio University. The game is held every year and is a big deal for both teams and their fans. The two universities are close to each other, about 80 miles away, and the game is played for a special trophy called the Bell. The game used to be played every year, but stopped for a few years when Marshall changed football conferences. However, the game started again in 2009 when the two teams played each other in a bowl game called the Little Caesars Pizza Bowl, and since then, the game has been played every year. Ohio has won more games against Marshall than Marshall has, with a total score of 33-20-6."}], "output": "  Joe Walker played for the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFL.**"},

He conducted groundbreaking research on the viral respiratory disease SARS, which helped the Chinese government prevent a major outbreak of the disease in 2004. Currently, he is the Director of China affairs at the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Hong Kong. In 2017, Guan warned that the H7N9 influenza virus poses a significant threat to humanity, being the greatest danger in the past 100 years.Pulmonary rehabilitation, also known as respiratory rehabilitation, is an important part of managing and keeping chronic respiratory diseases under control. It's a comprehensive treatment that involves multiple healthcare professionals and is based on evidence. It's for people who have chronic respiratory diseases and are still experiencing symptoms or have difficulty doing daily activities despite standard medical treatment. The goal of pulmonary rehabilitation is to improve the patient's quality of life. It can be done in different settings and may or may not include medication, depending on the patient's needs. The Journal of Thoracic Disease is a medical journal that focuses on pulmonology. It was started in December 2009 and is published monthly by AME Publishing Company. This journal is officially associated with several prestigious institutions, including the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, and the Society for Thoracic Disease. The editor-in-chief of the journal is Dr. Zhong Nanshan, who is based at the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases. According to a report called Journal Citation Reports, the journal's impact factor in 2016 was 2.365. The Irish Thoracic Society (ITS) is the official organization for healthcare professionals in Ireland who specialize in or are interested in treating people with breathing problems, such as chronic or acute respiratory diseases. Members include doctors like respiratory physicians, internal medicine physicians, pediatricians, thoracic surgeons, general practitioners, junior doctors, nurses, physical therapists, pharmacists, dietitians, and other healthcare providers. They come from all over Ireland, both North and South. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral illness that affects the lungs and is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV. In 2002-2003, a big outbreak of SARS happened in southern China, which caused 8,098 cases and 774 deaths in 37 countries. The majority of these cases were in Hong Kong, where the death rate was 9.6%. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there haven't been any new cases of SARS reported globally since 2004. Chronic Respiratory Disease is a quarterly medical journal that focuses on research related to breathing problems, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory failure, and obstructive sleep apnea. The journal is edited by three medical professionals: Mike Morgan from Glenfield Hospital, Carolyn Rochester from Yale University, and Sally Singh also from Glenfield Hospital. It was first published in 2004 and is currently released by SAGE Publications. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is a very serious respiratory disease that is caused by a virus. This virus comes from animals and can make people sick. It's called a zoonotic virus, which means it can be transmitted between animals and people. The disease is called SARS because it affects the respiratory system, which is the system in the body that helps us breathe. It can cause severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing and coughing, and can be very dangerous if it's not treated quickly. Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is a common upper respiratory or lung infection in cats caused by a virus called feline herpesvirus 1. This virus belongs to the Herpesviridae family. FVR is often referred to as feline influenza, feline coryza, or feline pneumonia, but these names don't accurately describe the condition. In fact, these terms can be misleading because they refer to other different respiratory problems in cats. Viral respiratory diseases are a significant concern for cats, especially in catteries and kennels, and FVR is the most common of these diseases, affecting cats worldwide. Another important cause of feline respiratory disease is feline calicivirus. Chronic infections with Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia can trigger or worsen asthma. These microbes cause long-term airway inflammation, impair mucus clearance, and increase mucus production, which can lead to asthma. Children who get severe respiratory infections, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or human rhinovirus (HRV), early in life are more likely to develop asthma later on. While RSV infections may increase asthma risk in young children, the association between RSV and asthma decreases with age. On the other hand, HRV is a key culprit in causing bronchiolitis and is strongly linked to asthma development. In people with established asthma, viral infections, particularly HRV infections, can cause acute asthma flare-ups. So, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and human rhinoviruses are important microorganisms that contribute to non-atopic asthma."}], "output": "  The full name of the viral respiratory disease that Yi Guan's research helped to prevent the outbreak of is Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)."},

When he was just 16 years old, he was arrested by the United States and held at Guantanamo Bay for ten years. During his time there, he pleaded guilty to some charges, including the murder of U.S. Army Sergeant 1st Class Christopher Speer. However, Khadr later claimed that he had falsely pleaded guilty in order to be returned to Canada. In 2017, Khadr sued the Canadian government for violating his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The lawsuit was settled with a payment of $10.5 million (approximately $8 million USD) from the government and an apology. The documentary Son of al Qaeda is about a young Canadian named Abdurahman Khadr, whose father was a close associate of Osama bin Laden.

The case went to a settlement, and as a result, Facebook sent checks to the people in the group worth $15 each starting from November 17, 2016. Insurance companies have a legal duty to settle claims in a fair and reasonable manner. This duty is implied in the insurance policy and is based on the insurer's promise to act in good faith. While most policies don't explicitly state that they promise to settle claims, insurers still have a duty to attempt to settle claims promptly and fairly. In California, if an insurer wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement offer within the policy limits, they can be held liable for the full amount of the judgment against the insured, even if it exceeds the policy limits.\n\nThe reason for this duty is that when an insurer receives a settlement offer that is within the policy limits, a conflict of interest arises between the insurer and the policyholder. The insurer must decide whether to accept the settlement or risk losing the case and being responsible for the full judgment. If the insurer denies coverage, they do so at their own risk. The insurer must also inform the policyholder of any settlement offers and cannot unreasonably coerce the policyholder into contributing to a settlement fund.

The cyclone started as a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on October 25, and its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days earlier. The storm gradually strengthened as it moved west-northwest, reaching cyclone strength the next day. Taking advantage of favorable weather conditions, the storm rapidly intensified and reached super cyclone status on October 28, with winds of up to 160 mph (260 km/h) and a record-low pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg). The cyclone made landfall in Odisha on October 29, and although it slowly weakened due to land interaction and dry air, it remained quasi-stationary for two days before drifting offshore as a weaker system. The storm finally dissipated over the Bay of Bengal on November 1. Kathantara (which means 'Another Story' in Odia) is a 2007 Indian Oriya language film directed by Himansu Khatua. The movie tells the story of the hardships faced by people during the 1999 Odisha cyclone, which caused widespread destruction and loss of life in the state of Odisha (formerly known as Orissa).In May 2017, Severe Tropical Cyclone Donna formed in the South Pacific, becoming the strongest off-season tropical cyclone on record. Donna was the 21st tropical disturbance, 3rd named storm, and 2nd severe tropical cyclone of the year. It started as an area of disturbed weather west of Fiji on May 1st and slowly moved eastward in a favorable environment. By May 3rd, it had intensified into a tropical depression and 12 hours later, it became a Category 1 cyclone. Donna's winds continued to strengthen, reaching its peak as a Category 4 cyclone on May 6th. However, wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken, and it reintensified into a Category 5 cyclone on May 8th. Donna then entered an area of strong westerly flow and rapidly weakened, eventually dissipating by May 16th. In the 1980s, Severe Tropical Cyclone Anne was one of the strongest tropical cyclones in the South Pacific. It started as a weak tropical depression near Tuvalu on January 5, 1988, along with another cyclone in the North-Western Pacific basin. Over the next few days, the system moved southwest and developed into a tropical cyclone, which was named Anne on January 8. Anne rapidly intensified and became a major tropical cyclone on January 11, reaching peak intensity as a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale and a Category 4 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. After turning southward, Anne hit New Caledonia on January 12, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory. The system weakened as it interacted with another tropical cyclone, and Anne eventually became a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia. In 2008, the strongest and longest-lasting tropical cyclone of the season, Intense Tropical Cyclone Hondo (designated as 16S by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center), formed in the South West Indian Ocean. Hondo was the third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of the season, developing from a tropical disturbance on February 2nd, about 1,020 kilometers (635 miles) east-southeast of Diego Garcia. The disturbance quickly intensified into a moderate tropical storm, and then a severe tropical storm the following day. Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone on February 7th, reaching peak winds of 215 kilometers per hour (130 miles per hour). Over the next few days, the cyclone gradually weakened as it moved forward, and on February 12th, it degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area. However, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction without developing, and on February 20th, it began to regenerate. The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression. But according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Hondo continued to strengthen and had winds of 95 kilometers per hour (60 miles per hour) before passing directly over Réunion. The interaction with the island caused the storm to weaken and degenerate into a remnant low once more. Finally, the storm dissipated on February 29th after executing a counterclockwise loop. The 2002-2003 Australian cyclone season was particularly active, with Cyclone Inigo being the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the region. The season began on November 1, 2002, and ended on April 30, 2003. The regional tropical cyclone plan defines a tropical cyclone year and season separately, with the year running from July 1 to June 30, and the season from November 1 to April 30. This means that most tropical cyclones form in the Australian region between July 1 and June 30 each year. During the 2002-2003 season, ten tropical depressions formed within these dates, with the first one, Tropical Cyclone 07S, entering the basin on December 27, 2002, and the last one, Cyclone Epi, dissipating on June 6, 2003. These tropical cyclones were monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers (TCWCs) located in Perth, Darwin, Brisbane, and Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu (also known as Cyclone Gonu) was the strongest tropical cyclone ever recorded in the Arabian Sea and the northern Indian Ocean. It developed in the eastern Arabian Sea on June 1, 2007, and quickly intensified due to favorable weather conditions and warm sea surface temperatures. Gonu reached peak winds of 235 kilometers per hour (145 miles per hour) on June 4, according to the India Meteorological Department. However, it weakened after encountering dry air and cooler waters, and made landfall on the easternmost tip of Oman on June 6, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Arabian Peninsula. It then moved northward into the Gulf of Oman and dissipated on June 7 after making landfall in southern Iran, the first landfall in the country since 1898. In May 2002, Tropical Cyclone Kesiny made landfall in the south-west Indian Ocean, becoming the first tropical cyclone to do so in the month of May. Kesiny formed on May 2nd from a trough (a low-pressure area) near the equator, and its formation was caused by an increase in the Madden-Julian oscillation (a climate phenomenon). This increase also led to the formation of other storms in the north Indian Ocean and northeast and southeast Indian Ocean. Kesiny initially moved southeast, but then turned southwest due to a strengthening ridge (a high-pressure area). On May 6th, Kesiny intensified into a tropical cyclone, but then weakened and was not expected to re-strengthen. However, Kesiny developed an eye and re-intensified into a tropical cyclone on May 9th, reaching wind speeds of 130 km/h (80 mph) before making landfall in Madagascar. The cyclone weakened as it crossed the country, then turned south and struck the country again before eventually dissipating on May 11th. In February and March 1992, a powerful tropical cyclone named Esau formed in the Pacific Ocean. It started as a shallow depression near Vanuatu and slowly grew stronger as it moved southwestward. Esau passed over several islands in Vanuatu and nearby New Caledonia before making landfall in New Caledonia on March 4 as a Category 3 severe tropical cyclone. After making landfall, Esau weakened and became an extratropical cyclone before its remnants were last seen over the South Pacific Ocean.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to explain any part of the rewritten paragraph. The 2011-2012 South Pacific cyclone season was one of the least active on record, with only three tropical cyclones forming during the period from November 1, 2011 to April 30, 2012. Any tropical cyclones that occurred before June 30, 2012 would be counted towards the season total. The strongest and only severe tropical cyclone of the season was Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine, which entered the South Pacific from another basin. Tropical cyclones in the South Pacific are monitored by two centers: the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center (TCWC) in Wellington, New Zealand. RSMC Nadi assigns an F designation to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the South Pacific, while the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issues unofficial warnings within the South Pacific and assigns numbers and a P suffix to tropical storm-equivalent or greater tropical cyclones. Both RSMC Nadi and TCWC Wellington use the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale to measure windspeeds, but RSMC Nadi measures windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC measures sustained winds over a period of one minute and uses the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale."}], "output": "  The strongest tropical cyclone to form in the South Pacific is Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine, which entered the basin from another region in 2011-2012."},

The original title of the magazine in Spanish is La Memoria de Nuestro Pueblo.The National Hot Rod Reunion is an event where people with a love for old cars and drag racing come together. It started as a copy of a popular event called the California Hot Rod Reunion. The first few years of the National Hot Rod Reunion were held in Bowling Green, Kentucky. In 2007, the event moved to Columbus, Ohio and took place on June 15-17. After that, the event returned to Bowling Green, Kentucky and has been held there every year since. Fender's Hot Rod DeVille is a combo tube guitar amplifier that was first introduced in 1996 as part of Fender's Hot Rod line of amplifiers. It's a modified version of the earlier Fender Blues DeVille, which was part of the Blues amplifier line, and has a higher level of gain in its preamplification signal. The DeVille has a 60-watt amplifier and comes in two different models: the 212, which features a pair of 12 speakers, and the 410, which features four 10 speakers. The DeVille is similar to the Fender Hot Rod Deluxe, which is another popular amplifier from Fender. California Hot Rod Reunion is an annual event held in Bakersfield, California, where drag racers, hot rod enthusiasts, and street rodders come together. The event was created in 1992 by Steve Gibbs, the vice-president of the National Hot Rod Association, as a one-time gathering of old drag racers. However, it became an annual event in October at Auto Club Famoso Raceway outside Bakersfield, and has since expanded to include the National Hot Rod Reunion in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Each year, a select group of pioneers in the sport of drag racing and hot rodding are honored at the event. The 25th annual California Hot Rod Reunion, presented by AAA and associate sponsor Good Vibrations Motorsports, will take place from October 21-23, 2016. In 2005, Volvo unveiled a concept car called the T6 at the SEMA show. Only one hand-built copy of the car was made, but there was talk of a potential limited production run. Under the hood, the T6 is powered by a twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter inline 6-cylinder engine from the Volvo S80, which generates 300 horsepower and can reach a top speed of 205 mph. What's unique about the T6 is that the engine is located behind the driver, giving it a hot rod-inspired design. The car's design is reportedly influenced by classic hot rod cars, and many people believe it resembles the Plymouth Prowler due to its sleek shape and body style. The T6 was named the 2004 Hot Rod of the Year by Hot Rod Magazine, and it was designed by Per Gyllenspetz of Labyrint studio and built by Leif Tufvesson. A rat rod is a type of custom car that mimics or exaggerates the style of hot rods from the 1940s, 1950s, and early 1960s. Unlike traditional hot rods, which are accurate reproductions or restorations of hot rods from the same era, rat rods are more playful and creative in their design. They often feature a mix of vintage and modern parts, and are known for their rough, unfinished look. So, while traditional hot rods aim to accurately preserve the past, rat rods are more about having fun and expressing personal style. The Fender Hot Rod Deluxe is a guitar amplifier made by Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. It was introduced in 1995 as part of the Hot Rod line of guitar amplifiers and has been produced continuously since then. The Hot Rod Deluxe is similar to the Fender Blues Deluxe from the earlier Blues line of amplifiers, but it has more gain in its preamp signal. This model, along with the Hot Rod Deville, were originally called Fender American Tube (F.A.T.) amplifiers, but Fender stopped using that name in 2002 when it moved production to its factory in Baja-Ensenada, Mexico.

He served as the King's Chamberlain and Colonel of the military staff, and he traveled with the monarch on a world tour in 1881. Kalākaua, born David Laʻamea Kamananakapu Mahinulani Naloiaehuokalani Lumialani Kalākaua, was the last king of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. He ruled from February 12, 1874 until his death in San Francisco, California on January 20, 1891. Kalākaua was known for his fun-loving personality and enjoyed entertaining guests with his singing and ukulele playing. During his reign, he made it okay for the traditional Hawaiian dance, called the hula, to be performed in public again after it had been banned in the kingdom. On special occasions like his coronation and birthday, the hula became a celebration of Hawaiian culture.James Alexander Sandy Winnefeld Jr. was born on April 24, 1956, and is a retired United States Navy admiral. He served as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from August 4, 2011, to July 31, 2015, which is the second-highest rank in the US Armed Forces. Prior to this position, Winnefeld commanded various naval forces, including the U.S. Sixth Fleet and the Allied Joint Command Lisbon. He also served as the Director for Strategic Plans and Policy at the Joint Staff and as a member of the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations Military Staff Committee. Winnefeld retired from the Navy in 2015 after over 37 years of service. The Merrie Monarch Festival is an annual week-long cultural celebration held in Hilo, Hawaii after Easter. It honors King David Kalākaua, who was known as the Merrie Monarch for his love of the arts and his efforts to revive many Hawaiian cultural traditions, including hula. Each year, many hula schools from Hawaii and around the world gather to showcase their skills in exhibitions and competitions. This festival has gained international recognition and is considered the most important hula competition in the world. The muumuu or muʻ umuʻ u is a flowing dress that originated in Hawaii. It hangs loosely from the shoulder and is often brightly colored with floral patterns or generic Polynesian designs. While muumuus for tourists are vibrant and eye-catching, those worn by local Hawaiians are more muted in tone. While muumuus were once commonly worn to work, they are no longer as popular as aloha shirts. However, they continue to be the preferred choice for formal events like weddings and festivals, such as the Merrie Monarch hula competition. Additionally, muumuus are a great option for pregnant women because they don't restrict the waist. George Walter Hunter Macfarlane was a British businessman, courtier, and politician who lived in the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1849 to 1921. He served as a high-ranking official in King Kalākaua's military staff and traveled with the monarch on his world tour in 1881. Macfarlane also served as the king's final chamberlain, which means he took care of the king's personal affairs and was by his side when he passed away in 1891. The Canadian Army had an administrative group called the Corps of Military Staff Clerks. This group was created in 1905 and was responsible for handling administrative tasks within the army. The Ottoman Military College, also known as the Imperial Military Staff College or Ottoman Army War College, was a two-year military training institution in Istanbul, Turkey. Its main goal was to educate and train high-level officers for the Ottoman Army. The college was established to provide advanced military training to officers, equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary to lead the army effectively. Located in the capital city of Istanbul, the college was an important part of the Ottoman Empire's military infrastructure. In the military, there is a team called a staff that helps the commander of a unit manage the day-to-day operations. The staff is made up of officers, enlisted personnel, and civilians who take care of things like logistics, communications, and other administrative tasks. The staff acts as a middleman between the commander and the units under their command, making sure important information gets through and unnecessary information is filtered out. In other words, the staff helps the commander make informed decisions by providing them with the right information at the right time. Fabianne Pomaialoha Wong Dalire, known professionally as Aloha Dalire, was a renowned Hawaiian hula teacher and master of the art. Born on June 22, 1950, and passing away on August 6, 2014, Aloha dedicated her life to preserving and sharing the traditional Hawaiian hula dance. In 1971, she won the prestigious Miss Aloha Hula title, which is considered the highest honor for a female hula dancer. This was the same year that the Merrie Monarch Festival was established, further solidifying Aloha's legacy in the world of Hawaiian hula."}], "output": "  The answer to your question is: Colonel Charles Hastings Judd.**"},

He wrote an impressive three hundred papers, making significant contributions to the fields of set theory and topology. Semyon Aronovich Gershgorin was a brilliant Soviet mathematician born in Pruzhany, Belarus, on August 24, 1901. He began his studies at the Petrograd Technological Institute in 1923 and became a professor there in 1930. In the same year, he was appointed to the Leningrad Mechanical Engineering Institute, where he made significant contributions to the field of mathematics, including the discovery of the Gershgorin circle theorem.  In topology, a nerve of an open covering is a way to create an abstract simplicial complex from an open covering of a topological space X. This construction helps to reveal many interesting topological properties in a straightforward and combinatorial manner. It was first introduced by Pavel Alexandrov and has since been developed into various versions and extensions, including the Čech nerve of a cover and hypercoverings. Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (February 3, 1898 - August 17, 1924) was a Russian mathematician who made important contributions to the field of topology. He is best known for developing two important theorems: Urysohn's Metrization Theorem and Urysohn's Lemma. These theorems are fundamental to the study of topology and are still used today. Urysohn's work is also remembered through various terms and concepts in mathematics, such as Urysohn universal space, Fréchet-Urysohn space, Menger-Urysohn dimension, and Urysohn integral equation. In addition, Urysohn and another mathematician named Pavel Alexandrov defined the modern concept of compactness in 1923. In the field of mathematics called topology, there's a technique called the Alexandroff extension. This technique allows us to take a non-compact space (meaning it's not bounded or finite) and add just one point to it in a special way. The resulting space is then compact, which means it's also bounded and finite. This technique was developed by the Russian mathematician Pavel Alexandrov. Semyon Davidovich Aranovich was a film director who was born on July 23, 1934, in Derazhnya, Ukraine, which was then part of the Soviet Union. He was known professionally as Semyon Aranovich. Aranovich passed away on September 8, 1996, in Hamburg, Germany. During his lifetime, he directed films in the Soviet and Russian film industries. Rafferty (also known as Рафферти in Russian) is a Soviet drama television film released in 1980, directed by Semyon Aranovich and based on the novel by American writer Lionel White. The Soviet six-part television film Confrontation (Russian: Противостояние), directed by Semyon Aranovich in 1985, is based on the novel by Yulian Semyonov. The movie Year of the Dog (Russian: Год собаки, God sobaki) is a 1994 Russian drama film directed by Semyon Aranovich. It was selected to compete at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won an award for its artistic merit. In math, the Gershgorin circle theorem helps us understand the range of values a square matrix can have. This theorem was first introduced by Soviet mathematician Semyon Aronovich Gershgorin in 1931. His name has been spelled differently in different languages, such as Geršgorin, Gerschgorin, Gershgorin, Hershhorn, and Hirschhorn."}], "output": "  Pavel Alexandrov has written more than 300 papers.**"},

It is the second ship ever named after the U.S. state of New Jersey. Interestingly, New Jersey has earned more battle stars for its actions in combat than any of the other three completed Iowa-class battleships. In fact, it was the only U.S. battleship to provide gunfire support during the Vietnam War. Rear Admiral J. Edward Snyder, USN (Ret.), was a notable naval officer who served as the captain of the USS New Jersey during its deployment to Vietnam in 1968. He was well-liked by his crew for his relaxed leadership style, which helped to motivate them during their time at sea. According to those who served under him, Captain Snyder was a sailor's captain, meaning that he understood the needs and concerns of his crew and was able to lead them effectively.The United States Navy and South Vietnam worked together in a successful operation called Operation Market Time, which started in 1965. The goal of this operation was to stop the flow of soldiers, weapons, and supplies from North Vietnam to parts of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The US Coast Guard also participated in the operation, providing heavily armed patrol boats and large cutters that were equipped with cannons for battle and gunfire support. These boats and cutters were used to patrol the coast and rivers, blocking the flow of supplies from the north. The USS Trippe (FF-1075) was a frigate in the US Navy that was built in Louisiana and commissioned in September 1970. After completing training and a surveillance mission, the ship entered a shipyard in Boston for an overhaul and the installation of a new missile system called the Basic Point Defense Missile System. This system featured short-range missiles called Sea Sparrows and was the first of its kind on a destroyer-type ship in the Navy. The ship spent the first months of 1972 testing its new weapons and participating in exercises. In June, the Trippe passed through the Panama Canal and headed to Southeast Asia, where it provided air and missile protection services during the Vietnam War. The ship then traveled to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, visiting many ports in the region. After a deployment that took it around the world, the Trippe returned to the US East Coast in December 1972. The United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and other groups are having a debate about what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play in the navy. The debate centers around the question of how these types of support can best help troops during amphibious assaults and other operations. At the core of the issue is how naval gunfire support, which involves using naval artillery to provide fire support, can contribute to the U.S. Navy's mission in the 21st century. Naval gunfire support (NGFS) is a tactic where Navy ships use their big guns to help ground troops during battles. NGFS is part of a larger field called Naval Fires. During amphibious assaults (attacks on coastal areas), NGFS is one of the three main ways that Navy ships help troops on the ground. The other two ways are by using aircraft and ship-launched missiles. Navy ships have been using their guns against shore defenses since the early days of naval warfare. * Launching air strikes from aircraft carriers against enemy forces\n* Providing naval gunfire support to ground troops\n* Conducting amphibious operations, such as landings and beachhead establishments\n* Patrolling and reconnoitering enemy areas\n* Engaging in mine warfare to disrupt enemy movements\n\nOverall, the Seventh Fleet played a significant role in the military efforts during the Vietnam War. In the 1890s, the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) began building modern battleships. Early designs were smaller, had light armor, and were faster than those of other countries. The first pre-dreadnought battleship design, the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class, was limited by budget constraints imposed by the government. Two ships were ordered by Admiral Simone de Pacoret Saint Bon, who was influenced by Benedetto Brin, who later became the naval minister after Saint Bon's death. Brin designed the next pair of battleships, the Regina Margherita class, which were larger than the previous class and intended to compete with Austro-Hungarian battleships. Brin died before the construction was complete. The next class of small pre-dreadnoughts, the Regina Elena class, were the fastest battleships in the world when they were finished. These ships served in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911-1912, providing naval gunfire support for the Italian ground troops while the Ottoman Navy mostly stayed in port. Kirov was a cruiser in the Soviet Navy that played a role in several major conflicts. During the Winter War, World War II, and the early years of the Cold War, Kirov bombarded Finnish coastal defense guns and helped evacuate the city of Tallinn. However, she was damaged by near misses and could only provide gunfire support during the Siege of Leningrad. Kirov also participated in the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive in 1944, but did not play a significant role in the war after that.

It's the official mammal of British Columbia. What makes this bear unique is that about 10% of its population has white or cream-colored fur, similar to polar bears. This coloration is due to a rare genetic trait that is only found in this subspecies. They are not albinos or related to polar bears, and they are the same species as other black bears found in Alaska and other parts of North America. Sometimes, a mother black bear will give birth to a white cub, but this is just a rare genetic occurrence and not a guarantee that the cub will have white fur.

The building was designed by the architectural firm of Kimball & Thompson and was slightly extended north in 1904, which changed its address to 64-70 Broadway. This made it the first skyscraper in Manhattan to exceed 100 meters in height. 712 5th Avenue is a 650-foot skyscraper located at the intersection of 56th Street and 5th Avenue in Manhattan, New York City. It was built from 1990 to 1991 and is currently the 53rd tallest building in New York City. The tower had to be designed to accommodate the historic facades of the Coty and Rizzoli Buildings at the base of the tower. In 2007, the Bannister Trust purchased the building in a private deal and placed it in Property Fund #1, which is managed by JP Morgan. Some people also refer to this building as the Henri Bendel building.Whole life insurance, also called straight life or ordinary life, is a type of life insurance that guarantees to remain in force for the rest of the insured person's life as long as required premiums are paid. It's a contract between the insured and the insurance company, where the insurer promises to pay a death benefit to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured person dies, as long as the terms of the contract are met. Unlike term life insurance, which has a fixed premium for a limited time, whole life insurance premiums are fixed and do not increase with age. The insured person pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies that can be paid off in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65. Whole life insurance is a type of cash value life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

The Supreme Life Building is a historic insurance building located at 3501 South Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the Douglas community area of Chicago, Illinois. It was built in 1921 and served as the headquarters of the Supreme Life Insurance Company, which was founded two years earlier. This company was groundbreaking because it was the first African-American owned insurance company in the northern United States, at a time when white-owned insurance firms often denied life insurance to black customers. As a result, the company played a crucial role in providing life insurance to Chicago's African-American community. Over time, the company became the largest African-American owned business in the northern states and a symbol of the economic success of the predominantly black Bronzeville neighborhood during the 1920s to 1950s. The Montreal New York Life Insurance Building, also known as the Quebec Bank Building, is an office building located in the heart of Old Montreal, built in 1887-1889. At the time of its completion, it was the tallest commercial building in Montreal, standing out among the other buildings due to its impressive height. The first eight floors of the building were designed for retail office space, which quickly became popular among the city's top lawyers and financiers. As a special addition, the building's owner filled the ninth and tenth floors with the largest legal library in the entire country, a generous gift to the tenants. The building is situated next to another historic office tower, the Aldred Building, adding to the rich history of the area.

Doyle was originally a doctor, but he decided to become a writer in 1887 when he published his first Sherlock Holmes novel, A Study in Scarlet. He went on to write four more novels and over 50 short stories featuring Holmes and his trusty sidekick, Dr. Watson. Dame Penelope Margaret Lively is a talented British writer who has made a significant impact in both the children's and adult literary worlds. Born on March 17, 1933, she has won prestigious awards for her works, including the Booker Prize for Moon Tiger in 1987 and the Carnegie Medal for The Ghost of Thomas Kempe in 1973, which is a highly regarded award for British children's books.Dead Man's Land is a book by Robert Ryan, set during World War I. It features Sherlock Holmes' trusty sidekick, Dr. Watson, who was created by Arthur Conan Doyle. Importantly, the book has been officially authorized by the Conan Doyle Estate Ltd. and written under license from the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle literary estate. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short story The Adventure of the Empty House is one of 13 tales in the collection called The Return of Sherlock Holmes. In this story, public demand led Doyle to revive the iconic detective Sherlock Holmes after he had seemingly died in a battle with his nemesis, Professor Moriarty. Doyle himself ranked The Adventure of the Empty House as the sixth best of his 12 favorite Holmes stories. The film The Return of Sherlock Holmes, released in 1929, is an American Pre-Code mystery movie directed by Basil Dean and written by Arthur Conan Doyle, Basil Dean, and Garrett Fort. The movie shares its title with the third volume of the Sherlock Holmes stories, also called The Return of Sherlock Holmes, written by Arthur Conan Doyle. The film stars Clive Brook, H. Reeves-Smith, Betty Lawford, Charles Hay, and Phillips Holmes. It was released on October 29, 1929, by Paramount Pictures and is currently held at the Library of Congress. Sherlock Holmes, a 1916 American silent film, stars William Gillette as Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective created by Arthur Conan Doyle.

This film is different from the original stories by Doyle because it features an original plot and not one of Holmes' well-known cases. In the movie, Holmes (played by Ben Syder in his film debut) and his trusty companion Dr. John Watson (played by Gareth David-Lloyd) investigate a series of strange monster attacks and uncover a plot to destroy London. This film was directed by Rachel Lee Goldenberg and produced by an independent American film studio called The Asylum.

Over the course of two years, Lydia flew 66 combat missions and shot down 16 enemy planes, making her the first female fighter pilot to achieve this feat. This was an impressive achievement, especially considering she was just one of two female fighter pilots in the entire Soviet Air Force. Tragically, Lydia was shot down and killed during the Battle of Kursk in 1943, as she attacked a formation of German planes. Despite her untimely death, Lydia's bravery and skill as a pilot have made her a legend in the history of aviation. Eino Ilmari Illu Juutilainen was a skilled fighter pilot in the Finnish Air Force during World War II. He is notable for being the top scoring non-German fighter pilot of all time, and therefore the top flying ace of the Finnish Air Force.

He was the son of King Khosrau II. In other words, Farrukhzad was the son of the previous king and took over as king for a short time before being replaced by another ruler. The Sasanian Empire, also known as the Sassanian or Neo-Persian Empire, was the last Persian Empire before the rise of Islam. It was named after the House of Sasan who ruled from 224 to 651 AD. The Sasanian Empire succeeded the Parthian Empire and was one of the most powerful nations in the world during its time, recognized alongside its neighboring rival, the Roman-Byzantine Empire. It lasted for over 400 years, making it a significant period in Iran's history.The Duchy of Thuringia was a region on the eastern border of the Merovingian kingdom of Austrasia, established around 631 by King Dagobert I after his troops were defeated by the Slavic confederation of Samo at the Battle of Wogastisburg. The duchy was re-established in the Carolingian Empire and its rulers were appointed by the king. In around 908, the territory was taken over by the Saxon dukes. From around 1111/12, the Duchy of Thuringia was ruled by the Landgraves of Thuringia as princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Khosrow IV was a short-lived ruler of the Sasanian Empire in 631 AD. Unfortunately, there isn't much information available about his reign, as this was a time of great turmoil and upheaval within the empire. He was the son of Mah-Adhur Gushnasp, who was a prominent minister during the reign of Ardashir III, and Kahar-dukht, the daughter of Yazdandar, who was the son of Khosrau I. It's possible that Khosrow IV ruled over a specific region or province rather than the entire empire, as there were other pretenders around the same time, such as Hormizd VI. Unfortunately, he was killed shortly after taking power. Samo, a Frankish merchant, founded the first recorded political union of Slavic tribes, known as Samo's Empire, which spanned from present-day Silesia to Slovenia. He ruled from 623 until his death in 658. According to the only contemporary source, Fredegarius, Samo united several Slavic tribes to protect them from robber raids and violence by nearby settled Avars. He showed great bravery and leadership skills in battle, earning him the title of Slavic king (Latin: Rex Sclavorum). In 631, Samo successfully defended his realm against the Frankish Kingdom in a three-day battle at Wogastisburg. Chach (also spelled Chachu or Chacha) was a Brahmin king who ruled Sindh in the mid-7th century CE. Before becoming king, he served as the prime minister to King Rai Sahasi II. After the king's death, Chach married the widow and eventually took over the throne. Under his rule, the Brahmin dynasty expanded the kingdom of Sindh and conquered nearby kingdoms and ethnic groups, creating an empire that spanned the entire Indus valley and beyond. This history is recorded in the Chach Nama, a historical text that provides details about Chach's reign. Ashur-etil-ilani was the king of Assyria from around 631 BC to around 627 BC. He took over from his father, Ashurbanipal. Sintila, also known as Swinthila or Svinthila, was the King of the Visigoths in Hispania, Septimania, and Galicia from 621 to 631. During his reign, there was a period of peace in the Visigoth kingdom, which allowed him to regain control of territories that had previously been under the control of the Byzantine Empire. Sintila was the son of King Reccared I and his wife Bado, and the brother of a powerful general named Geila. Samo's Empire, also known as the Slavic tribal union established by King Samo, existed from 631 to 658 AD. The main center of the union was likely located in Moravia, while it also included areas such as Silesia, Bohemia, Lusatia, and Carantania. Hormizd VI was a king who ruled parts of Persia from 630 to 631 during the Sasanian period. He was one of many pretenders who emerged after the murder of King Khosrau II in 628. Hormizd maintained his power for about two years, from 630 to 632, in the region of Nisibis. Interestingly, he was the grandson of King Khosrau II, making him a direct relative of the previous king."}], "output": "  The answer to your question is:\n\nThe empire that Farrukhzad Khosrau V succeeded was the Sasanian Empire.**"},

David Mirkin was born on September 18, 1955, in Philadelphia. He initially wanted to be an electrical engineer, but he changed his mind and studied film at Loyola Marymount University instead. After graduating, he became a stand-up comedian and then started writing for TV shows. He wrote for popular sitcoms like Three's Company, It's Garry Shandling's Show, and The Larry Sanders Show, and was even the showrunner on the series Newhart. However, Mirkin's next project, a remake of the British series The Young Ones, didn't do well. So, he created Get a Life in 1990, which starred comedian Chris Elliott and ran for two seasons despite some executives at the Fox network not liking the show's dark and surreal humor. Mirkin then created the sketch show The Edge with his partner, actress Julie Brown. The Young Ones is a classic British sitcom that aired in the UK from 1982 to 1984, split into two six-episode series on BBC2. This show was known for its unique, offbeat humor that helped bring alternative comedy to television in the 1980s. The show made household names of its talented writers and performers, and in 1985, it was even featured on the fledgling MTV channel as one of the first non-music shows. In a 2004 poll, The Young Ones ranked 31st on the BBC's list of Britain's Best Sitcoms. The show's title is a nod to the classic song of the same name, written by Sid Tepper and Roy C. Bennett and sung by Cliff Richard and The Shadows, which reached the top of the UK charts in 1961."}], "output": "  The actor who also performed in The Young Ones is Adrian Edmondson."},

Tecumseh was a powerful Shawnee warrior and chief who emerged as the leader of a large, multi-tribal alliance in the early 1800s. Born in what is now Ohio, he grew up during the American Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War. These experiences instilled in him a vision of creating an independent Indian nation east of the Mississippi River, which he sought to establish under the protection of the British. To achieve this goal, he worked tirelessly to recruit more members to his tribal confederacy from the southern United States.The Kasi or Kansi are a large Pashtun tribal confederacy that originated from the son of Kharshbun, who was the son of Sarban. They are primarily found in Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a significant portion residing in the city of Quetta in Balochistan, Pakistan. Another major part of the Kasi tribe is known as Shinwari, who live in the eastern valleys of Nangarhar Province, Afghanistan, and around Landi Kotal in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and Kohat District in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. Tenskwatawa, also known as the Shawnee Prophet, was a Native American leader who lived from January 1775 to November 1836. He was the younger brother of Tecumseh, the leader of the Shawnee tribe. When Tenskwatawa was young, he was given the name Lalawethika, which means He Makes a Loud Noise or The Noise Maker. However, he later changed his name and transformed himself into a powerful spiritual leader. Tenskwatawa denounced the Americans, calling them the offspring of the Evil Spirit, and led a movement that promoted unity among American Indians, rejected acculturation to American ways of life, and encouraged his followers to stick to their traditional ways. In the early 19th century, a group of Native Americans in the Old Northwest, known as Tecumseh's Confederacy, began to form around the teachings of a prophet named Tenskwatawa, also known as The Prophet. Over time, the confederation grew to include thousands of warriors, with Shawnee leader Tecumseh, the brother of The Prophet, becoming the leader of the group by around 1808. The United States saw the confederation as a threat and launched a preemptive strike in 1811, resulting in the Battle of Tippecanoe. Under Tecumseh's leadership, the confederation fought against the United States in both Tecumseh's War and the War of 1812. After Tecumseh's death in 1813, the confederation disbanded. Ziri ibn Atiyya, also known as Ziri ibn Atiyya ibn Abd Allah ibn Tabādalt ibn Muhammad ibn Khazar az-Zanātī al-Maghrāwī al-Khazarī, was a prominent leader of the Berber Maghrawa tribe in North Africa. He lived from around 930 to 1001 and was the first leader of the Maghrawa tribal confederacy and kingdom. This makes him an important figure in Berber history and culture. On November 7, 1811, a big battle called the Battle of Tippecanoe took place in what is now Battle Ground, Indiana. American forces led by Governor William Henry Harrison of the Indiana Territory fought against Native American warriors, including Shawnee leader Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa (also known as The Prophet). These Native American leaders were trying to stop the US from taking over their land. As tensions and violence increased, Governor Harrison led an army of about 1,000 men to attack the Confederacy's headquarters at Prophetstown, which was located near the confluence of the Tippecanoe and Wabash Rivers. Prophetstown State Park is located near the town of Battle Ground, Indiana, USA, about a mile east of the site of the Battle of Tippecanoe. The park is named after Tenskwatawa, a religious leader and younger brother of Shawnee leader Tecumseh. It was established in 2004 and is the newest state park in Indiana. The park features the Museum at Prophetstown, which recreates a Native American village and a 1920s-era farm. The Battle of Fallen Timbers, which took place on August 20, 1794, was the final battle of the Northwest Indian War. This conflict was fought between Native American tribes who were part of the Western Confederacy, with the support of British Captain Alexander McKillop, and the United States. The Northwest Territory, which includes land north of the Ohio River, east of the Mississippi River, and southwest of the Great Lakes, had been ceded to the United States in 1783, but the Native Americans (who were not part of the treaty) refused to give up control. The British maintained army bases in the area to support their Native allies. This led to an American offensive, which ultimately resulted in the withdrawal of the British and Native American forces from the territory following the Treaty of Greenville. The Battle of Fallen Timbers was a significant victory for the United States and marked the end of major hostilities in the region until Tecumseh's War and the Battle of Tippecanoe in 1811. Zafar (also spelled Dhafar or Ẓafār) is an ancient Himyarite site located in Yemen, about 130 kilometers south-south-east of the capital city of Sana'a. The site is mentioned in several ancient texts, and its name is pronounced as written. Although some people in Oman claim that Zafar in Yemen is newer than its namesake in Oman, the site in Yemen is actually much older.

This war was fought between Irish Catholic immigrants and French Canadians. The conflict started when a group of Irish men, led by a timber operator named Peter Aylen, attacked other timber operations. This group was called the Shiners. They also attacked French Canadian timber rafts and fought with the French Canadians on the streets of Bytown. French Canadians, also known as Franco-Canadians or Canadiens, are a group of people who trace their ancestry back to French settlers who arrived in Canada from the 17th century onwards. Today, French Canadians make up the largest French-speaking population in Canada, accounting for about 22% of the total population.The Oku people, also known as Oku Mohammedans or Aku Mohammedans in Sierra Leone and the Gambia, are an ethnic group in both countries. They are the descendants of freed Africans from Southwest Nigeria who were brought to Sierra Leone and the Gambia in the mid-19th century. These individuals formed a unique ethnic group and are predominantly Muslim. The British colonial government officially recognized the Oku Mohammedan community as a distinct group in Sierra Leone. However, while the Sierra Leone government considers the Oku people to be part of the Creole ethnic group, many Sierra Leoneans view them as a separate ethnic group. The Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) is an Irish Catholic organization that was founded in New York City in 1836. The group is open to anyone who is Catholic and either born in Ireland or of Irish descent. Its original purpose was to protect Catholic churches from anti-Catholic forces in the mid-1800s and to help Irish Catholic immigrants who faced discrimination or difficult working conditions, particularly in the coal mining industry in Pennsylvania. Many members of the AOH had ties to the Molly Maguires, a secret society of Irish American miners who fought for better working conditions and against discrimination. Over time, the AOH became a significant political force for Irish Americans. The Pinpu tribe people, also known as the Pepo or Plains tribes, lived in the western plains of Taiwan for a long time. They used to live a simple agricultural life before many Han immigrants arrived in Taiwan. From the 17th century onwards, the Pinpu tribes faced strong forces from outside, such as the Dutch, Spanish, and Han Chinese, and they were unable to resist being assimilated. By the end of the 19th century, most of the Pinpu tribes had lost their language and culture and became a nearly invisible ethnic group in a society dominated by the Han Chinese. During the Japanese rule, Japanese scholars studied the Plains tribes using anthropology and ethnology, which led to the current classification of the Plains tribes as follows: African Bermudians or Bermudians with African ancestry are people from Bermuda who have roots in the African continent. They are descended from Black Africans who were brought to Bermuda as slaves, as well as some Black Bermudians who chose to immigrate to the island as indentured servants in the 17th century. By the 19th century, the Black population in Bermuda had grown and became the largest ethnic group on the island. However, for a long time, the Black population was classified as Coloured alongside other non-white groups in Bermuda. It wasn't until the 20th century that the term Black Bermudian became widely recognized and accepted as a distinct ethnic group. Today, Black Bermudians make up the largest ethnic group in Bermuda. The Irish are the largest ethnic group in Philadelphia and the surrounding counties. They have been living in the city since before the American Revolution, with some Irishmen even participating in pro-Revolutionary activities during the war. As Philadelphia grew and became more diverse in the 19th century, the city saw an influx of immigrants from Europe, including the Irish. Many Irish arrived in Philadelphia in 1844, fleeing the Irish Famine. Because the Quakers of Philadelphia were known for their religious tolerance, Irish Catholics and Protestants, as well as other immigrants, were able to find a welcoming home in the city. As Philadelphia became a major industrial center in the United States, the Irish took on industrial jobs. However, anti-Catholic sentiment grew in the city during the 1840s and 1850s, leading to riots and discrimination against the Irish. Despite these challenges, the Irish eventually gained financial and social status in Philadelphia and went on to found institutions and make significant contributions to the city. In Liberia, there is a group of people known as Americo-Liberians or Congo people. They are a Liberian ethnicity that consists of African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and liberated African ancestry. The Sierra Leone Creole people are their sister ethnic group, and they share similar ancestry and culture. Americo-Liberians trace their ancestry back to free-born and formerly enslaved African Americans who immigrated to Liberia in the 19th century and became the founders of the country. Today, the terms Americo-Liberian and Congo are used interchangeably to refer to this ethnic group, which is made up of the descendants of various free and ex-slave African American, Caribbean, Recaptive, and Sierra Leone Creoles who settled in Liberia from 1822. People of Irish descent make up the largest ethnic group in Boston, Massachusetts. In the 19th century, Boston underwent significant changes when many European immigrants arrived, including the Irish. The Irish were the largest group of newcomers during this time, mostly due to the Great Irish Famine. This influx of Irish immigrants transformed Boston from an Anglo-Saxon, Protestant city into a more diverse place. The Yankees hired Irish workers and servants, but there wasn't much social interaction between the two groups. In the 1840s and 1850s, the anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant Know-Nothing movement targeted Irish Catholics in Boston. However, during the American Civil War in the 1860s, many Irish immigrants fought for the Union, which helped to reduce prejudice against them. The Czechs in Ukraine, also known as Volhynian Czechs, are ethnic Czechs or their descendants who settled in the Volhynia region of Ukraine in the late 19th century. Between 1868 and 1880, around 16,000 Czechs left Austria-Hungary and moved to Tsarist Russia. They left their homeland due to difficult living conditions and were attracted by the idea of prosperity and cheap land in Russia. The local government offered them various incentives, such as the right to buy land at low prices, the ability to start businesses, and religious and cultural freedom. They were also exempt from taxes and military service for 20 years. Many Czechs settled in areas such as Volhynia, Zhytomyr, and Lutsk, and established new villages with Czech names like České Noviny, Český Malín, and Český Boratín. They also engaged in various activities like industry, trade, and crafts, which helped to boost the local economy. The Czechs established schools, churches, and libraries, which led to a flourishing of their cultural and social life. As a result, they made a significant contribution to the economic and cultural development of the region."}], "output": "  The ethnic group who settled in Canada in the 17th century and participated in the Shiners' War is:\n\n**Irish**"},

William Goldman was born on August 12, 1931, and is a well-known American novelist, playwright, and screenwriter. He rose to fame in the 1950s as a novelist, but later shifted his focus to writing for film. Goldman has won two Academy Awards for his screenplays, including Best Original Screenplay for the western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in 1969 and Best Adapted Screenplay for All the President's Men in 1976, which tells the story of journalists who exposed the Watergate scandal involving President Richard Nixon. Both films starred Robert Redford.In Australia, property law is the set of rules that explains how people's rights, interests, and responsibilities are related to things they own or have a right to use. These things can be anything from land and buildings to intangible things like books or ideas. The law decides who has the highest claim to these things and whether they are real (like land) or not (like a book). There has been a lot of debate among law scholars about what can be considered a thing that can be owned or controlled, and when someone becomes the priority owner of that thing. Joshua D.

Zimmerman is fluent in several languages, including Yiddish, Polish, Hebrew, Russian, and French. In around 1912, Chilean poet Vicente Huidobro started a literary movement called Creationism (Spanish: creacionismo). This movement is based on the idea that a poem is something completely new and original, created by the author just for the sake of existing. The author doesn't write a poem to praise something else, or to please the reader, or even to understand the poem themselves. The poem is its own entity, with its own purpose and meaning. The Man Booker International Prize is an international literary award held in the United Kingdom. In 2004, the award was introduced to complement the existing Man Booker Prize. The award is sponsored by Man Group and was given every two years from 2005 to 2015 to a living author of any nationality who has made a significant contribution to fiction in English or through English translations. The prize recognized an author's entire body of work rather than just one book, and the judges selected their own nominees without inviting submissions. William Walton wrote his Viola Concerto in 1929 at the request of Sir Thomas Beecham and for the violist Lionel Tertis. The concerto is dedicated to Tertis' wife, Christabel (Christabel McLaren, Lady Aberconway). However, Tertis initially rejected the manuscript, and the work was first performed by Paul Hindemith. The concerto was well-received, and Walton's talent was recognized, with one critic from The Manchester Guardian saying, This young composer is a born genius and calling the concerto the best thing in recent music of any nationality. Tertis eventually changed his mind and began playing the work. Hans Christian Andersen, a famous Danish poet and author, wrote a story called The Most Incredible Thing (Danish: Det Utroligste). The story is about a contest where people had to come up with the most amazing thing they could think of, and the consequences that followed when the winner was chosen. The story was first published in the United States in September 1870, before being published in Danish in Denmark in October of the same year. Interestingly, this was the first time The Most Incredible Thing was published in Denmark during World War II, and Andersen himself considered it one of his best tales. A Thing of Beauty is a novel written by A.J. Cronin, first published in 1956 under the alternative title Crusader's Tomb. The novel follows the story of Stephen Desmonde, an English painter who faces challenges in a society that doesn't fully appreciate his art. Throughout the book, Stephen sacrifices everything for his passion for painting, even though he struggles to get recognition for his work. The title of the novel is a reference to a famous poem by John Keats, which starts with the line A thing of beauty is a joy for ever. John W.

It is centered around the Øresund strait, which separates the two cities of Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmö, Sweden. These cities are connected by a bridge that spans the strait, called the Øresund Bridge, as well as a ferry route that goes through the narrowest point of the strait between Elsinore, Denmark (also known as Helsingør) and Helsingborg, Sweden. The Øresund/Öresund/Oresund Bridge (in Danish, Swedish, and a hybrid name) is a bridge and tunnel combination that connects Sweden and Denmark across the Øresund strait. The bridge spans nearly 8 kilometers from the Swedish coast to a man-made island called Peberholm in the middle of the strait. After crossing Peberholm, the journey continues through the 4-kilometer Drogden Tunnel to the Danish island of Amager.The Bjarkøy Fixed Link is a proposed project that will connect three islands in the municipality of Harstad, Troms county, Norway. The project involves building a subsea road tunnel and a bridge to connect Grytøya and Sandsøya, and a bridge to connect Bjarkøya. The subsea tunnel will be 3.25 kilometers long, and the bridge to Grytøya will be 300 meters long, plus an additional 900 meters of causeway. The project will also include 3 kilometers of road on Grytøya to connect the new tunnel to the existing roads. The Bjarkøy Tunnel will be part of Norwegian County Road 867, while the Sandsøya Bridge will be part of Norwegian County Road 124. Malmö Harbour Heliport (IATA: JMM, ICAO: ESHM) is an heliport located in Malmö, Sweden. Before the Öresund Bridge was built in 2000 and before Sweden joined the Schengen Area in 2001, Malmö Harbour Heliport and port had passport and customs checks, and there were helicopter and speedboat connections directly to Copenhagen Airport's transfer area. The Øresund (also known as Öresund) is a strait that separates the Danish and Swedish territories. It's about 118 kilometers long and its width varies from 4 kilometers to 28 kilometers. At its narrowest point, it's only 4 kilometers wide between the cities of Helsingør in Denmark and Helsingborg in Sweden. Sweden (Swedish: Sverige) is a country in Northern Europe, officially known as the Kingdom of Sweden. It's located near Norway and Finland, and is connected to Denmark by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, covering 450,295 square kilometers. The country has a total population of around 10 million, with 2.3 million people having a foreign background. Sweden has a relatively low population density, with 22 people per square kilometer. The majority of the population (85%) lives in urban areas. European route E47 is a highway that runs from Germany to Sweden, passing through Denmark. This route is also known as the Bird Flight Line and South Motorway. The road has motorway standards throughout its length, except for a 28-kilometer stretch in Germany, which is a city street in the town of Helsingør. There are also two ferry connections along the route, one between Germany and Denmark, and another between Denmark and Sweden. In 2020, a fixed link is planned for this route, which will replace the ferry connections. The decision to build a tunnel instead of a bridge was made after the Danish parliament rejected plans for a bridge across the Fehmarn Strait, citing safety and environmental concerns. Additionally, there is a ferry connection between Denmark and Sweden in the city of Helsingør. While there is a bridge-tunnel combination further south, this ferry route still has a frequent schedule. The City Tunnel (Swedish: Citytunneln) is a 17-kilometer rail link in Malmö, Sweden that connects Malmö Central Station (Malmö C) to the Öresund Line (Öresund Bridge). Six kilometers of the tunnel run under Malmö city center to increase capacity on the regional network by turning Malmö C from a terminal into a through station. The project was expected to cost 9.45 billion SEK and began construction in March 2005. The line was officially inaugurated by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden on December 4, 2010, and passenger service began on December 12, 2010. The Öresund Committee, also known as Öresundskomiteen, was an organization that aimed to promote political cooperation among the regions in the Öresund area. The Öresund region includes Sweden's southernmost province of Skåne and several Danish islands, such as Zealand, Lolland, Falster, and Bornholm. With a combined population of approximately 3.7 million people, the Öresund region is a significant area of collaboration and cooperation between Sweden and Denmark. Copenhagen Malmö Port AB (CMP) operates the ports in Copenhagen, Denmark's capital, and Malmö, Sweden's third largest city. These ports are located on opposite sides of Øresund, a strait that separates the two countries. Øresund Region, which includes both cities and their surrounding areas, is the largest metropolitan area in the Nordic countries in terms of population. To connect the region, there is a bridge that spans Øresund at its southern end, and a ferry route between Helsingør, Denmark and Helsingborg, Sweden."}], "output": "  The bridge that connects Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmo, Sweden spans 8 kilometers in length. **"},

These ferns are part of the Marsileaceae family, which is named after Luigi Ferdinando Marsili, an Italian naturalist who lived from 1656 to 1730. Brabejum is a unique genus of tree that only has one species, Brabejum stellatifolium, which is commonly known as wild almond, bitter almond, or ghoeboontjie. This tree is found in the Western Cape Province of South Africa, where it grows along the banks of streams in thickets. The plant is special because it's the only member of the large grevilleoid subfamily found in Africa.\n\nThe Brabejum tree is a small to medium-sized bushy tree with branches that grow close to the ground and produce many tall, sturdy stems. The leaves are long and narrow, with rounded teeth, and they grow in groups of six along the branches. In the summer, the tree produces white flowers that are packed closely together on long stems that grow from the leaf axils. The flowers are followed by fruit that are similar to almonds, but they're a reddish-brown color. Unfortunately, the nuts are too bitter to eat, but in the past, people used to boil, roast, and grind them to make a coffee-like drink.Sinocyclocheilus is a group of fish found only in China, mostly in the provinces of Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan. All of the species in this group live in or around caves, and they have special features that help them survive in these dark environments. Many cave-dwelling Sinocyclocheilus species don't have scales, are pale in color, and have small eyes or even no eyes at all. Some have a humpback or a horn on their head, but it's not clear what these do. However, the Sinocyclocheilus species that live outside of caves, as well as a few that live underground, look different and don't have these special cavefish features. They are smaller in size, reaching up to 23 cm in length, and have smaller ranges and populations. Many of the species in this group are threatened, and their populations are not well understood. The genus Myiodynastes is a group of birds in the family Tyrannidae, created by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1857. This genus contains five species of birds that are commonly referred to as sulphur-bellied flycatchers. The name sulphur-bellied flycatcher is also used to refer to one of the individual species in the genus. The genus name Myiodynastes is made up of two Greek words: muia, meaning fly, and dunastẽs, meaning ruler. Leptospermum is a group of shrubs and small trees in the myrtle family (Myrtaceae) that are commonly known as tea trees, although this name is sometimes also used for other species of Melaleuca. Most Leptospermum species are found in Australia, particularly in the south, but some are also native to New Zealand and Southeast Asia. All Leptospermum flowers have five petals and five groups of stamens that alternate with the petals. There is a single style in the center of the flower, and the fruit is a woody capsule. The first formal description of a Leptospermum was published in 1776 by German botanists Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Johann Georg Adam Forster, but it wasn't until 1979 that an unambiguous definition of individual species in the genus was established. Leptospermum species can be found in a variety of habitats, but they prefer moist, low-nutrient soils. They have important uses in horticulture, honey production, and floristry. Araripesuchus is an ancient group of crocodile-like animals that lived in the Cretaceous Period, a long time ago. There are at least five different species of Araripesuchus found in both West Africa and South America. Scientists are still arguing about how these different species are related to each other. One of the species, called Araripesuchuswegeneri, is particularly interesting because it has long legs and an upright gait, which means it walked on its hind legs like a bird. This animal also has unusual teeth that suggest it might have eaten both plants and animals. Plus, its slender limbs and the way they are positioned on its body show that it was a land-dwelling animal, which is different from its modern-day cousins, crocodiles and alligators, which live in water. Overall, Araripesuchuswegeneri is unique and different from other crocodile-like animals. The Marsileaceae family is small and consists of heterosporous aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns that don't look like other ferns at first glance. Despite their unconventional appearance, they are often referred to as the pepperwort family or water-clover family because their leaves resemble those of a four-leaf clover (a flowering plant). In fact, some people have used Marsilea leaves as a substitute for clover leaves on Saint Patrick's Day. The family contains three genera and between 50 and 80 species, with most belonging to the genus Marsilea. The Be'er Sheva fringe-fingered lizard (Acanthodactylus beershebensis) is a type of lizard that belongs to the Lacertidae family. It's a member of the subgenus Lacertinae and the tribe Acanthodactylus, which includes spiny footed lizards. This species is considered unique because of its distinct physical features and because it's found in a specific area. Although it shares some genetic similarities with other lizards in the same genus, it's been classified as a separate species. Like other Acanthodactylus lizards, the Be'er Sheva species lays eggs, typically between three and seven at a time. The adults grow to be around 17-20 centimeters long, but some can get much bigger. This species is only found in the loess scrublands of the Negev desert in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, which is a region known for its biodiversity. Fens are one of the main types of wetlands, along with grassy marshes, forested swamps, and peaty bogs. Both fens and bogs are considered mires. Fens are special types of wetlands that are fed by mineral-rich water, either from the surface or underground. They have a unique water chemistry that is neutral or slightly alkaline, with high levels of dissolved minerals but low levels of other plant nutrients. Fens are usually dominated by grasses and sedges, and often have brown mosses like Scorpidium or Drepanocladus. These wetlands are home to a variety of other plant species, including carnivorous plants like Pinguicula. They can also be found along large lakes and rivers, where changes in water level create wet soils with few woody plants. The distribution of fen plants is often linked to the water regime and nutrient levels in the area. Marsilea minuta, also known as dwarf waterclover, is a type of aquatic fern in the Marsileaceae family. It's important to note that Marsilea minuta is not the same as Marsilea vestita, which is a different species. This fern is also known by several other names, including gelid waterklawer, small water clover, airy pepperwort, and pepperwort. However, the last of these names can also refer to plants in the genus Lepidium, so it's important to be clear which plant you're talking about. In French, Marsilea minuta is called marsilea ponctuée."}], "output": "  Of these options, the genus with the most individual species is Marsilea with 65 different species."},

It's located on 86 St James's Street in the central London area of St James's, right across from St James's Palace. While Freemasons' Hall is the headquarters of the United Grand Lodge of England and the Supreme Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of England, Mark Masons' Hall serves as the home of several other important groups within English and Welsh Freemasonry. St James's Palace is the most important royal palace in the United Kingdom. It's located in the City of Westminster, which is a part of London. Although it's no longer the main home of the monarch, it's still a very important place for royal events and meetings. In fact, it's where the Accession Council meets to make important decisions about the royal family. Additionally, some members of the royal family still live in St James's Palace.Warriparinga, meaning Windy Place in the local Kaurna language, is a nature reserve located in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. It covers an area of 3.5 hectares in the suburb of Bedford Park. This reserve is significant for its historical, cultural, and environmental importance. It was once a traditional Kaurna ceremonial meeting place and the site of early European settlement. Warriparinga is also known by other names such as Fairford, Laffer's Triangle, and the Sturt Triangle. It is bordered by three roads - Marion Road, Sturt Road, and South Road - and the Sturt River flows through it as it travels from Sturt Gorge to the Adelaide Plains.   In Canada, the President of the Queen's Privy Council (also known as the President du Conseil privé de la Reine pour le Canada in French) is officially in charge of the Privy Council Office. However, this person's role is mostly ceremonial and they only preside over meetings of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, which is a group that only gathers for important events such as the accession of a new monarch or the prince's marriage. The last time the President of the Privy Council had to preside over a meeting of the Privy Council was in 1981, when Prince Charles of Wales got engaged to Lady Diana Spencer. In other words, this position is similar to the role of Lord President of the Council in the United Kingdom. The Great Hall of the People is a significant state building located at the western edge of Tiananmen Square in Beijing. It serves as a venue for important legislative and ceremonial events hosted by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the ruling Communist Party of China. The Great Hall is the meeting place for the annual sessions of the Chinese parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), which takes place in March every year. It also hosts the national session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a political advisory body, during the same period. Additionally, the National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which has been held every five years since 1982, takes place at the Great Hall. In the UK, when a monarch dies (called demise of the crown), a special group called the Accession Council gathers at St James's Palace to announce the new monarch. According to a law passed in 1701, the new monarch takes over automatically when the old one dies. The Accession Council then officially names the new monarch in a proclamation. The Grange Hall in Somerset Township, Jackson County, Illinois, was the meeting place of Somerset Township's chapter of The Grange. Built in 1912, the building was the second meeting hall for Somerset Grange #1553, which was established in 1876. The red brick building was constructed by contractor W. A. Pitman in a Commercial style. The Grange Hall served as a gathering place for local farmers to discuss agricultural issues and propose policies to lawmakers. In fact, the National Farmers Union's newspaper, the Union Farmer, was published from the Grange Hall until 1914. The building also served as a social center for the community, hosting township elections, club meetings, and other events. After undergoing renovations in 1988, the Grange Hall is still used as a polling place today. Crowther Masonic Hall, also known as Freemasons' Hall in Kollam, is part of the Grand Lodge of India and serves as a meeting place for various Masonic Lodges in the Quilon (Kollam) area. It is located near Kochupilamoodu in Kollam city and has been a Masonic meeting place since 1806. Today, the building is recognized as a historic monument of Freemasonry activities in the ancient Travancore area. The Pollokshields Burgh Hall is located at the edge of Maxwell Park in Glasgow, Scotland. It was built in the 17th-century Scottish Baronial style and opened in 1890 by Sir John Stirling Maxwell as a Masonic meeting place and community center. Initially, the hall served only the independent burgh of Pollokshields, but when the city grew and expanded, it absorbed the area in 1891. The hall contained various council offices and a courtroom, and it continues to be used as a Masonic meeting place to this day. As a result, the building is filled with Masonic symbols, particularly in the carvings at the back of the hall and the stained-glass windows. The Blackman-Bosworth Store, also known as the Bosworth Store Building, S.N. Bosworth's Cheap Cash Store, David Blackman's Store, and Randolph County Museum, is a historic general store located in Beverly, Randolph County, West Virginia. It was built around 1828 and had an addition added in 1894. The original building is a two-story brick structure on a cut-stone foundation. Over the years, the building has served various purposes, including operating as a general store, county courthouse, post office, and informal meeting place. In 1973, the Randolph County Historical Society purchased the property and turned it into the Randolph County Museum, which is still used for meetings and exhibitions today."}], "output": "  The building opposite the ceremonial meeting place of the Accession Council in the United Kingdom is Mark Masons' Hall.**"},

Prior to his invention, Ward was a hairdresser from Yorkshire, England. However, Ward's insistence on retaining majority ownership of the formula for Starlite (51%) and his belief that the technology was worth billions of dollars hindered its commercial success. Maurice Ward, an amateur chemist and hairdresser, invented a special material called Starlite in the 1970s and 1980s. Starlite is said to be able to withstand and insulate against extremely high temperatures. In 1993, Ward's invention received a lot of attention when it was featured on the popular science and technology show Tomorrow's World. Ward's granddaughter, Kimberly, came up with the name Starlite.  William Levett (also known as William de Livet), who lived around 1200-1270, was the lord of a small village in South Yorkshire called Hooton Levitt, which was named after his ancestors. He also became the owner of the patronage of Roche Abbey after he married the granddaughter of Richard FitzTurgis, a powerful Norman baron who co-founded Roche Abbey with the great-nephew of another important Norman baron, Roger de Busli. The Nidderdale Museum is located in a former workhouse in the town of Pateley Bridge, North Yorkshire, England. Inside the museum, you'll find exhibits that showcase rural life in the area. These exhibits include period rooms and business displays, such as a cobbler's workshop, a schoolroom, a Victorian parlour, a general store, a 1930s hairdresser's shop, and a kitchen.

The West Yorkshire Association Football League is a football competition based in Yorkshire, England. Until 1939, it was called the Leeds League, but it was renamed to reflect its broader scope. Despite its name, the league actually includes clubs from both the Harrogate and York areas of North Yorkshire. The University of Leeds is a prestigious university located in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It was founded in 1831 as the Yorkshire College of Science, and later changed its name to the Yorkshire College. In 1887, it merged with the Leeds School of Medicine and became part of a larger university called the federal Victoria University, which also included Owens College (now the University of Manchester) and University College Liverpool (now the University of Liverpool). In 1904, the university received a royal charter from King Edward VII, which officially recognized it as the University of Leeds. Bedale is a market town and civil parish located in the district of Hambleton, North Yorkshire, England. Historically, it was part of the North Riding of Yorkshire and is situated about 34 miles north of Leeds, 26 miles southwest of Middlesbrough, and 7 miles southwest of the county town of Northallerton. The town has a rich history, with records of its existence dating back to the Domesday Book, which listed it as part of Catterick wapentake, also known as Hangshire. This name is believed to have come from Hang Bank in Finghall, and the area was known for the many gallows used to execute marauding Scots. Today, Bedale is a predominantly agricultural area with a growing tourism industry. Bedale Beck, a tributary of the River Swale, runs through the town and flows into the Yorkshire Dales, a beautiful and popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. The East Riding of Yorkshire is a local government area in England with its own authority. It's also a ceremonial county, which means it has its own cultural and historical significance. The name East Riding comes from the ancient East Riding of Yorkshire, which was one of three ridings in the county of Yorkshire. Until 1974, Yorkshire was divided into three ridings, including the East Riding, North Riding, and West Riding. When the local government system changed in 1974, the East Riding became part of the Humberside region. However, in 1996, the East Riding regained its independence and became a separate local government district. Bradley is a village located in the Craven district of North Yorkshire, England. It's situated between Skipton and Keighley, about half a mile from the A629 road and two miles from the nearby town of Skipton. The village is divided into two areas: High Bradley and Low Bradley, which are often referred to together as Bradleys Both. However, historically, the village was known as Bradley Ambo. Despite being physically located in North Yorkshire, Bradley has a postal town and dialling code from West Yorkshire. Norman Yardley was an English cricketer who played for Cambridge University, Yorkshire County Cricket Club, and England. He was a right-handed batsman and occasional bowler, and he played for these teams from 1937 to 1955. Yardley was an amateur cricketer, which means he didn't play for money, but he was very skilled and talented. He captained Yorkshire and England, and he led Yorkshire to many victories. In fact, he was named the Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1948, which is a big honor in the cricket world. In his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he was called Yorkshire's finest amateur since Stanley Jackson, which means he was considered one of the best amateur cricketers in Yorkshire."}], "output": "  The material invented by Maurice Ward was named by his granddaughter Kimberly.

It serves as the headquarters of the Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited. The building is situated at 1 Garden Road, in the Central and Western District of Hong Kong Island. In other words, it's located in the heart of Hong Kong Island, close to many other important landmarks and financial institutions. One Raffles Place, previously known as Overseas Union Bank Centre or OUB Centre, is one of the tallest skyscrapers in Singapore. It was the tallest building in the city along with UOB Plaza and Republic Plaza until 2016, when Tanjong Pagar Centre was completed. At 280 meters tall, it was also the tallest building in the world outside of North America when it was completed in 1986, surpassing South Korea's 63 Building, which was finished a year earlier. The building is located in the heart of Raffles Place.São Paulo, Brazil's largest city, has an impressive skyline with a remarkable number of buildings. In fact, it's home to the third-highest concentration of buildings in the world, after New York City and Hong Kong. Within the city and its surrounding area, there are 193 buildings that reach over 100 meters in height, most of which are located in the downtown area along Paulista Avenue and the neighborhood of Brooklin. At one time, São Paulo was home to the tallest building in Latin America, the Martinelli Building, which opened in 1929 and stood at a height of 130 meters. The largest building in the city, the Mirante do Vale, is 170 meters tall and was built in 1960. However, today most of the buildings in São Paulo are relatively low, typically reaching no more than 80 meters in height and are mostly residential. The city has laws in place that limit the construction of tall skyscrapers, and the tallest skyscrapers are located in three different areas. Despite this, São Paulo still has a significant number of buildings that are over 90 meters tall, placing it among the top 10 cities in the world with the most buildings of this height. One Raffles Link (Chinese: 莱佛士连道一号) is an office building located in Marina Centre, Singapore. It stands at six storeys high with a basement and is managed by Hongkong Land. The building was completed in 2000 and was designed by two renowned architectural firms, Kohn Pedersen Fox and Aedas LPT Architects. The development cost S$340 million and is a Grade A office building. Major tenants of the building include VISA, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, and Citibank. What's unique about One Raffles Link is that it's built on a long, narrow piece of land, which allows for the largest column-free floor plates in the city. The development also includes CityLink Mall, Singapore's first underground mall, which connects the building to several other popular destinations in the area, including City Hall MRT Station, Raffles City, Marina Square, Suntec City, and the Esplanade. CapitaGreen, also called Market Street Tower, is an office building located in Raffles Place, Singapore. The building was designed by famous Japanese architect Toyo Ito and was completed in 2014. It stands at a height of 242 meters, making it one of the tallest skyscrapers in Singapore. Chevron House, previously known as Caltex House, is a tall skyscraper situated in the central business district of Singapore. It's located on 30 Raffles Place, right in the heart of the financial district of Raffles Place. The building is close to several other notable structures and landmarks, including Singapore Land Tower, Hitachi Tower, Change Alley, and The Arcade, all of which are within a 100-meter radius. Additionally, Chevron House has direct underground access to the Raffles Place MRT Station, making it incredibly convenient for commuters. Interestingly, Hitachi Tower, a neighboring building, shares a four-level retail podium with Chevron House. Raffles Place MRT Station is an underground station on the North South Line and East West Line of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system in Singapore. It's located right beneath the financial district of Raffles Place, which is in the heart of the city. This station is one of the busiest in Singapore because it's an interchange station, meaning you can transfer between two lines, making it a convenient stop for many people. The station has several entrances and exits, with two main ones facing Raffles Gardens. The building itself is a miniature replica of the historic John Little building, which gives it a unique look. Republic Plaza (Chinese: 共和大厦) is one of the three tallest skyscrapers in Singapore, situated at the southern end of Raffles Place in the Downtown Core, the central business district of Singapore. It shares the title of tallest building with two other buildings, the OUB Centre and UOB Plaza One. The building stands at an impressive 280 meters (919 feet) tall and was completed in 1995. What's interesting is that Singapore is not in an earthquake zone, yet the building has been designed with earthquake-proof features. This shows how the building's designers have taken into account potential risks and developed strategies to mitigate them. One Marina Boulevard, also known as NTUC Centre, is a 32-story skyscraper located at 1 Marina Boulevard in the heart of Singapore's central business district. The building stands at an impressive height of 110 meters and is situated near other tall buildings, such as One Raffles Quay, The Sail @ Marina Bay, and Ocean Building, all of which are within a 100-meter radius.

Raffles Place is the central hub of Singapore's Financial District, located just south of the mouth of the Singapore River. In the 1820s, it was originally called Commercial Square and was designed to be the commercial heart of Singapore according to the Raffles Town Plan. It was later renamed Raffles Place in 1858 and is now home to many major banks. Located within the Downtown Core of the Central Area, Raffles Place boasts some of the tallest buildings and landmarks in the country."}], "output": "  One Raffles Place is one of the tallest skyscrapers in the city of Singapore and the tallest in the world outside of North America, until it was succeeded by a building in 2016.

Boren or United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.? \n\n Passage: United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 US 131 (1948), also known as the Hollywood Antitrust Case of 1948 or the Paramount Case, was a major Supreme Court decision that changed the way movies were made, distributed, and shown in theaters. The case involved movie studios owning their own theaters and requiring exclusive agreements with theaters to show their films. The Supreme Court ruled that this arrangement violated antitrust laws, which prohibit companies from making exclusive deals with other businesses. This decision would have a significant impact on the way Hollywood movies were produced, distributed, and shown in theaters. In the landmark case of Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976), the Supreme Court of the United States made a historic decision that changed the way it reviews statutory or administrative classifications based on sex. For the first time, a majority of the Court ruled that these types of classifications are subject to a higher level of scrutiny, known as intermediate scrutiny, under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that the Court will carefully examine whether these classifications are fair and reasonable, and whether they serve a compelling government interest.Block booking is a system used by movie studios to sell multiple films to theaters in bulk. This practice was common among major studios from the 1930s until it was illegalized by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1948. Under block booking, independent theater owners were required to purchase large numbers of movies from studios without seeing them first. This allowed studios to divide their movies into two categories: A-list features and second-rate films. By selling both types of movies together, studios could reduce their costs for production and distribution. The part of the system where theaters bought movies without seeing them is called blind bidding. In 1971, a case called Richard John Baker v. Gerald R. Nelson made its way to the Minnesota Supreme Court. The court ruled that a state law that only allowed people of the opposite sex to get married did not violate the US Constitution. Baker appealed, but the US Supreme Court dismissed the appeal in 1972, saying there wasn't enough of a federal question to hear the case. Because the case was reviewed by the US Supreme Court through a legal process called mandatory appellate review, rather than through a request to review the case (called certiorari), the dismissal was considered a decision on the merits. This made the case precedent, but there was debate over how much weight it would carry. In 2013, Minnesota legalized same-sex marriage, and in 2015, the US Supreme Court explicitly overturned Baker in a case called Obergefell v. Hodges, making same-sex marriage legal throughout the US. R v Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507 is a landmark case that helps us understand Aboriginal rights under the Constitution Act of 1982. The Supreme Court ruled that Aboriginal fishing rights don't allow them to sell fish commercially. This decision led to the creation of the Van der Peet test, which is used to determine if an Aboriginal right exists. This case is the first of three cases in the Van der Peet trilogy, which also includes R v NTC Smokehouse Ltd and R v Gladstone. In the case of United States v. Binion, 132 F. App'x 89 (8th Cir. 2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit used two recent Supreme Court decisions (United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005) and United States v. Fanfan, 543 U.S. 220 (2005)) to review the sentencing decision made by the trial court, which was later upheld by the Federal District Court for the Eastern District. In 1999, a significant case called Lau Kong Yung v. Director of Immigration was heard by the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal. This case followed closely after a previous landmark decision, Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration, which had happened earlier that year. After Ng and three other cases, but before Lau came before the Court of Final Appeal, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) of China issued an interpretation of the Basic Law, which affected the rights of Lau and the other applicants. This made Lau the first case where the Court of Final Appeal had to consider an NPCSC interpretation when applying the Basic Law. In 2006, the Ohio Supreme Court heard a case called Norwood, Ohio v. Horney. This case came after a previous Supreme Court case called Kelo v. City of New London, which was decided in 2005. In Kelo, the US Supreme Court ruled that cities could use eminent domain to support economic development. The Norwood case focused on the specific rules in the Ohio State Constitution regarding eminent domain, while Kelo dealt with the US Constitution. During Morrison Waite's time as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States (from March 4, 1874 to March 23, 1888), the Supreme Court heard a high number of criminal cases. In fact, the Court heard 106 criminal cases in just 14 years, which is almost as many cases as the Supreme Court had heard in its entire history up to that point. Some of the notable criminal cases the Court heard during this time include United States v. Cruikshank (1875), United States v. Reese (1875), Reynolds v. United States (1878), Wilkerson v. Utah (1879), the Trade-Mark Cases (1879), Strauder v. West Virginia (1880), Pace v. Alabama (1883), United States v. Harris (1883), Ex parte Crow Dog (1883), Hurtado v. California (1884), Clawson v. United States (1885), Yick Wo v. Hopkins (1886), United States v. Kagama (1886), Ker v. Illinois (1886), and Mugler v. Kansas (1887). During its time on the bench from 1801 to 1835, the Marshall Court heard only about 41 criminal law cases, which works out to slightly more than one case per year. These cases included some significant ones, such as United States v. Simms (1803), United States v. More (1805), Ex parte Bollman (1807), United States v. Hudson (1812), Cohens v. Virginia (1821), United States v. Perez (1824), Worcester v. Georgia (1832), and United States v. Wilson (1833)."}], "output": "  Of the cases listed, Craig v.

The station is just a short walk from these attractions, making it a convenient stop for visitors and commuters alike. The Kertha Gosa pavilion is a beautiful example of Balinese architecture located in the city of Klungkung on the island of Bali, Indonesia. It was built in the early 18th century by a local king named Dewa Agung Gusti Sideman, and its first purpose was as a court of law in 1945. Over the years, the pavilion has been repainted twice, in the 1920s and again in the 1960s. Interestingly, the discovery of the Kertha Gosa pavilion was not well-known outside of Bali, and it was only through writings and stories shared by local people that its rich history became apparent. One of the most unique features of the pavilion is the beautiful Bhima Swarga story painted around its ceiling. This is a Hindu epic mentioned in the Mahabharata, and it tells a small section of the larger story. The Oleson Park Music Pavilion, also known as the Karl King Bandshell, is located in Fort Dodge, Iowa, USA. This pavilion is important because it was designed by Henry L. Kamphoefner, a famous architect from Sioux City, and it was built as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project during the Great Depression. The WPA paid for 85% of the construction costs, while the City of Fort Dodge paid the remaining 15%. The pavilion is made of poured concrete and has a Modernist style with Art Deco elements. It stands at 36 feet tall and is known for its excellent acoustics. The pavilion replaced an older bandstand that was built in the 1920s in the city square. In 1976, it was dedicated to Karl King, a famous composer who advocated for its construction. In 2003, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Concord Pavilion, previously known as Sleep Train Pavilion and Chronicle Pavilion, is an outdoor amphitheater located in Concord, California. The City of Concord owns and Live Nation operates it. The venue can hold up to 12,500 people and has been open since 1975 as Concord Pavilion. It is used for various events, including concerts, local community gatherings (such as an annual jazz festival), and high school graduations in the area. Paulus Hook is a community located in Jersey City, New Jersey, near the Hudson River. The name Hook comes from the Dutch word hoeck, which means point of land. This point of land is situated between Montgomery, Hudson, Dudley, and Van Vorst Streets. The main street in the neighborhood is Washington Street, which runs north and south. The waterfront of Paulus Hook is along the Morris Canal in a park that also includes a portion of Liberty State Park. The Hudson-Bergen Light Rail has a stop at Essex Street, and the Liberty Water Taxi has a stop at Warren Street. With the introduction of the light rail and the development of office buildings along the Hudson River, more businesses have moved to Morris Street, including several restaurants with outdoor seating and small neighborhood shops. A sala (also called a sala Thai or sala Khmer) is a type of open pavilion used as a meeting place and for protection from sun and rain. Most salas are open on all four sides. They are found throughout Thailand, particularly in Buddhist temple areas or wats, but can also be found in other locations. Building a sala at a temple or in a public place can bring religious merit to the person who builds it. A sala located in a temple is called a salawat, while a large sala in a temple is called a sala kan parian, where monks can receive religious instructions. Government offices or city halls are also called sala wa kan or sala klang changwat, meaning government pavilion or provincial main pavilion. Corus Quay, previously known as First Waterfront Place, is an eight-story commercial office tower located on a 2.5-acre waterfront site in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This $160 million building is the first major development in the East Bayfront district and was completed at the foot of Jarvis Street. Corus Quay is now the new headquarters of Corus Entertainment, which will consolidate its 10 locations and 1,200 employees into one site. The building was developed by the Toronto Economic Development Corporation (TEDCO), a city agency, and funding came from a combination of TEDCO's equity, city loans, and a $12.5 million contribution from the city through Waterfront Toronto. The Grandview Park Music Pavilion is a historic building located in Sioux City, Iowa, USA. In 1930, the Monahan Post Band raised money to build a simple music shell in the park. However, the neighbors objected to the original design, so the project was put on hold until more funds were raised and a better design could be found. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the Civil Works Administration (CWA), and the city applied to have the new music shell included in Sioux City's CWA projects. An unknown architect named Henry L. Kamphoefner designed the plans for the structure. The sculptural plaques on the front of the pavilion were created by Herschel Elarth. The CWA approved the project in February 1934, and the construction required 52 tons of reinforcing steel, 4,200 bags of Portland cement, and 300 bags of white cement. The pavilion was completed on October 17, 1934, and it could seat 5,000 people in the natural amphitheater. The federal government provided $47,436 for the project, and the city contributed $3,800 in materials. The pavilion was dedicated in the spring of 1935, and the Monahan Post Band continued to perform there until 1948, when they became the Sioux City Municipal Band. Today, the music pavilion is listed on the National Register of Historic Places."}], "output": "  The nickname of the city where Darling's Waterfront Pavilion is located is Bangor."},

It's the home of Sporting Kansas City, a professional soccer team in Major League Soccer (MLS). The stadium opened in 2011 and has a seating capacity of 18,467 seats, which can expand to 25,000 for concerts. On average, about 21,000 people attend Sporting KC games because of different seating configurations. This is the third home venue for the team, which previously played at Arrowhead Stadium from 1996 to 2007 and CommunityAmerica Ballpark from 2008 to 2010. In 2013, the stadium hosted three major soccer events: the MLS All-Star Game, the US men's national soccer team, and the MLS Cup. This is the only stadium to host all three events in the same year. CommunityAmerica Ballpark is a baseball stadium located in Kansas City, Kansas, in the neighborhood of Piper. It's the home of the Kansas City T-Bones, a professional baseball team in the American Association, and was previously the home of the Kansas City Wizards (now Sporting Kansas City) of Major League Soccer.

The stadium was even the site of a 2008 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup match between Sporting Kansas City and the Colorado Rapids. The 1997 Kansas City Wizards season was the team's second in Major League Soccer (MLS) history. They played their home games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Unlike other professional sports leagues, MLS did not allow games to end in ties, so if a game was tied at the end of regulation, the teams would play a shootout to determine the winner. This means that the statistics provided below do not include goals scored in shootouts. Additionally, the team's actual point total in the regular season was 49, but it is shown below as 63. In MLS, a shootout win counted as 2 points, while a shootout loss counted as 0 points. The Kansas City Wizards played their 1999 season at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. MLS did not allow ties in 1999, so to decide draws, the team used shootouts. This means that the stats do not include goals scored in shootouts. The team's actual point total in the regular season was 20, but it is shown as 24. In shootouts, the Wizards earned 2 points for a win and 0 points for a loss. The team's first manager, Ron Newman, was let go and replaced with Bob Gansler. In 2004, the ninth annual MLS Cup championship game was held between D.C. United and the Kansas City Wizards. The match was played at The Home Depot Center in Carson, California on November 14, 2004. D.C. United won the game 3-2, thanks to an own goal scored by a Wizards defender named Alex Zotinca.

These plants belong to the subgenus Oxycoccus of the genus Vaccinium. In Britain, the term cranberry usually refers to a native plant called Vaccinium oxycoccos, while in North America, it can refer to a different plant called Vaccinium macrocarpon. Vaccinium oxycoccos is grown in central and northern Europe, while Vaccinium macrocarpon is grown throughout the northern United States, Canada, and Chile. In some classifications, Oxycoccus is considered a separate genus. Cranberries are typically found in acidic bogs in the cooler regions of the northern hemisphere. Captain Henry Hall was an American from Dennis, Massachusetts who fought in the American Revolutionary War. After the war, he became the first person to successfully cultivate cranberries. This was a significant achievement, as cranberries were a new and unknown fruit in the United States at the time. Hall's innovation helped to establish cranberries as a major crop in the country and paved the way for the industry to grow and thrive.Vice-Admiral Robert Plampin (1762-1834) was a British Navy officer who served in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He is best known for his time as commander of the British colony of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he oversaw the imprisonment of former French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Plampin was born into a Navy family and began his naval career at the age of 13, serving in the American Revolutionary War. He later served in various ships during the French Revolutionary Wars, including a shipwreck and two sieges. After the Peace of Amiens, Plampin took command of the ship of the line HMS Powerful and operated successfully in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In 1816, following Napoleon's defeat and capture, Plampin was placed in command of the squadron at the Cape of Good Hope, which included Saint Helena, where he had numerous conversations with Napoleon. The Historic Camden Revolutionary War Site is a national historic district and outdoor museum located in Camden, Kershaw County, South Carolina. It's about 40 minutes away from Columbia, the state capital, and is one of the state's most popular tourist attractions.

Today, Ringer Hut has over 550 restaurants in Japan, Taiwan, and San Jose, California, as well as 100 Hamakatsu restaurants (a tonkatsu chain). The company has two headquarters, one in Fukuoka and one in Tokyo. Police perjury, also known as testifying falsely in police slang, refers to a police officer providing false testimony in a criminal trial. This can happen when the officer is trying to secure a conviction for a suspect they believe is guilty, but irregularities during the arrest or search could lead to an acquittal.

Essentially, it means lying under oath to obtain a conviction, which is illegal and unethical. On February 2, 2006, Jacob D. Robida, a 19-year-old from Massachusetts, attacked three people at a gay bar in New Bedford, Massachusetts. After fleeing the state, he kidnapped a woman named Jennifer Rena Dunlap Bailey and drove to Charleston, West Virginia. A police officer named James W.

Robida then shot and killed Bailey, his kidnap victim, with a Ruger 9mm semi-automatic pistol. The police then opened fire on Robida, who shot himself in the right side of the head. In Japan, there's a social phenomenon called part-time job terrorism (バイトテロ, baito tero) where people work part-time jobs and perform silly stunts or pranks, like climbing into ice cream freezers or holding their bodies horizontally suspended (known as planking) on the countertops of fast-food restaurants. The purpose of these stunts is to get attention and likes on social media from their peers. This phenomenon is common among people who are unhappy with their part-time jobs, which are often associated with low pay and long working hours.

This game is all about baseball and is named after Frank Thomas, a famous baseball player. Frank Thomas, also known as The Big Hurt, is a former professional baseball player who played in Major League Baseball from 1990 to 2008. During his career, he played for three teams in the American League (AL): the Chicago White Sox, with whom he spent most of his time. Thomas was an incredibly skilled hitter and one of the best players of his era. In fact, he is the only player in major league history to have seven consecutive seasons with a .300 batting average and at least 100 runs batted in (RBI), 100 runs scored, 100 walks, and 20 home runs. Over this period, he batted an impressive .330 and averaged 36 home runs and 118 RBI per year. Thomas was a perennial Most Valuable Player (MVP) candidate throughout the 1990s and was named the AL's MVP by unanimous vote in 1993 after leading his team to a division title. He repeated as MVP in the strike-shortened 1994 season after hitting .353 and leading the league in slugging average and runs. Thomas had two subpar seasons following his MVP wins, but he still managed to earn AL Comeback Player of the Year honors in 2000 after posting career highs of 43 home runs and 143 RBI.John Paul Jack Fox was a professional baseball player who played for 11 seasons, including one season in Major League Baseball.

Fox started his career as an outfielder but later became a pitcher, and he had a career minor league batting average of .251 with 670 hits in 694 games played. As a pitcher, Fox had a win-loss record of 90-63 in 185 career minor league games pitched. Fox batted and threw right-handed. Ronald Herbel was a right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1960 to 1969.

In total, he played in 67 games, with 62 at-bats, 19 runs, 18 hits, 2 doubles, 3 triples, and 5 stolen bases, with a fielding percentage of .893 and a batting average of .290. The 1921 Detroit Tigers finished last in their league with a record of 71-82 games behind the Yankees. Despite their poor performance, the Tigers had some impressive individual statistics, including the highest team batting average and most hits in American League history. Their outfielders, Harry Heilmann and Ty Cobb, finished first and second in the league batting race with averages of .394 and .389, respectively. The team's outfielders also ranked among the leaders in RBIs. However, the Tigers' pitching was weak, with a team ERA of 4.40 and allowing nine or more runs 28 times throughout the season. This early on, the baseball adage Good Pitching Beats Good Hitting was proven true. Charles Henry Chick Shorten was an American baseball player who played professionally for 18 years from 1911 to 1928. During his career, he played for eight different teams in Major League Baseball, including the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, St. Louis Browns, and Cincinnati Reds. Shorten was a key member of the Red Sox team that won the World Series in 1916, and he had an impressive batting average of .571 in that series. Overall, Shorten appeared in 527 games in the major leagues, with 352 of those games played in the outfield, and he hit .275 overall. In baseball, a batter's success rate at getting a hit is measured by their batting average (AVG). In Major League Baseball (MLB), this is calculated by dividing the number of hits a player gets by the number of times they bat (AB). The player with the highest batting average at the end of the season wins the batting title in their league. In MLB, the American League (AL) winner is called the Rod Carew American League Batting Champion, while the National League (NL) leader is called the Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion. To qualify for the batting title, a player must have at least 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game, which is equivalent to 502 PA over a full season of 162 games. However, if a player has a big enough lead in AVG, they can win the title even if they don't meet the plate appearance requirement. For example, in 1996, Tony Gwynn had 159 hits in 451 ABs, but he only had 498 PA. If we add four hitless ABs to his total, his batting average would drop to .349, but he would still have the highest batting average among eligible players, so he was awarded the NL batting title."}], "output": "  The answer to the question is Frank Thomas.

The song is performed by Jerry Orbach and Angela Lansbury in the movie, and it's a big musical number that takes place in the castle where Belle lives. The song is meant to welcome Belle to the castle, and it's a very elaborate and Broadway-style performance by the castle's enchanted objects. Menken originally wanted to replace the melody of the song with something else, but he couldn't come up with a satisfactory replacement, so he kept the original melody. The song was originally intended for Belle's father, Maurice, but the story changed and the song ended up being about Belle instead. The lyrics had to be rewritten several times as the story evolved to make sure the song remained focused on Belle.

It's the main park in the town and covers an area of around 104 hectares. The park was designed to have plenty of space for sports and activities, as well as beautiful gardens, a lake for boating, and a wooded area. It was created in the 1920s by the talented landscape architect Thomas Mawson. Salisbury Woodland Gardens is a beautiful open space located in the east of Blackpool, near the intersection of East Park Drive and Woodside Drive. Locals often refer to it as the Woodland Gardens. In 1924, Blackpool Corporation acquired the site and developed it as a shelter belt for the nearby Stanley Park Golf Course. Over the years, the gardens were expanded and transformed into an arboretum and public open space, which was renovated in 1967 by a team led by Peter Perry, known as the Flying Squad. The gardens were once a popular wedding photo location, but fell into decline in the 1990s. However, the Council's Ranger Service took over the gardens in September 2006 and has been working to restore and protect them through fundraising and maintenance efforts.In Europe, especially in cabarets, the person who introduces acts and hosts the show is called a conférencier. This term emerged in the 1920s and became associated with people who not only introduced acts but also shared their political and social views. These commentators became popular and influential, but they also attracted criticism from the Nazi regime. As a result, the Nazis cracked down on these commentators and tried to limit their freedom of speech.

Patan Minara is a 5,000-year-old Buddhist monastery located eight kilometers from Rahim Yar Khan city in Pakistan. According to historians, the monastery was built during the Mauryan period (250 BC) and served as the capital of a Hindu kingdom in 10 AD. Some archaeologists believe that Alexander the Great, who passed through the area during his military expedition to India, built the structure as a cantonment with a watchtower to keep an eye on the local tribes. There is a mystery surrounding the monastery that claims there was once a hidden treasure within its walls. Despite being demolished by the 18th century, a brick with Sanskrit writing was discovered, adding to the mystery and intrigue surrounding this ancient historical site.

He plays the Sarod, a traditional Indian stringed instrument. Apratim's unique style of playing, which is inspired by the Dhrupadee Veenkar tradition of Ustad Alauddin Khan's Seni Veenkar Gharana, is characterized by his imaginative and melodic approach to playing. He seamlessly weaves together complex rhythmic patterns and melodic phrases with incredible technical skill and maturity. As an internationally recognized instructor of classical Indian music, Apratim is widely respected for his artistic vision and dedication to preserving the rich traditions of Indian classical music. The sarod (or sarode) is a stringed instrument that's a big deal in Indian classical music. Along with the sitar, it's one of the most popular and important instruments in Hindustani classical music. The sarod has a deep, rich, and introspective sound that's different from the sweet and complex sound of the sitar. One of the things that makes the sarod special is that it has sympathetic strings that give it a really resonant and reverberant quality. It's a fretless instrument, which means it can produce smooth, continuous slides between notes called meend (glissandi) that are important in Indian music.Chander Bari is a Bengali movie released in 2007, directed by Tarun Majumdar. The film revolves around a middle-class joint family, and is based on a Bengali story written by Pracheta Gupta. To add to the film's charm, Majumdar used some beautiful Rabindra Sangeets (songs) in the movie. The sousaphone is a brass instrument similar to the more well-known tuba. It was invented in 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the request of John Philip Sousa, who wanted a more portable and easier-to-play instrument for marching bands. The sousaphone produces sound when the musician moves air through their lips, causing them to vibrate into a large cup-shaped mouthpiece. Unlike the tuba, the sousaphone is curved to fit around the musician's body and has a large, forward-pointing bell that projects the sound ahead. Because of its convenience and sound projection, the sousaphone is widely used in marching bands and other musical genres. Initially made of brass, sousaphones are now also made of lighter materials like fiberglass, which are more practical for musicians. The Norwegian and Swedish words bukkehorn or bockhorn, also known as the Billy Goat Horn in English, refer to an ancient Scandinavian musical instrument made from the horn of a ram or goat. The horn is typically harvested 5 to 7 years before it's crafted into an instrument. In the past, shepherds and milkmaids used this horn as a signaling instrument or a scaring device on summer dairy farms in the mountains. With the addition of finger holes, the instrument can now produce melodies. The bukkehorn can be played using two different techniques: the most common is the trumpet-style, while the clarinet-style is also used. Experimental musical instruments are created when a musician modifies or changes an existing instrument or class of instruments, or invents a completely new type of instrument. They can use simple materials like metal objects or household items to create a new sound, like inserting objects between piano strings or using bathtub plugs as a mute for a brass instrument. Other experimental instruments are made by combining acoustic and electronic components, or by using electronic spare parts to create a unique sound. The possibilities are endless when it comes to creating new and innovative musical instruments! Udaka Vadya is an Indian musical instrument that is believed to have originated from either Jal Tarang or a similar instrument. This percussion instrument is classified as a diophonic instrument, meaning that the sound is produced by striking a surface. According to medieval Indian musical treatises, such as Vatsyayana's Kamasutra and Sangeeta Parijata from the 17th century, Udaka Vadya has been mentioned as an important instrument in Indian classical music. In fact, the skill to play this instrument was considered one of the 64 essential skills that a woman was expected to learn in order to be considered well-versed in Indian classical music. The keyboard glockenspiel, also known as the jeu de timbre, is an instrument that is played by a piano keyboard. It was first used by George Frideric Handel in his oratorio Saul in 1739, and later used in other works such as Il Trionfo del Tempo and Acis and Galatea. Fifty years later, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart used a similar instrument, called a strumento d'acciaio, in his opera The Magic Flute to represent Papageno's magic bells. Today, this part is sometimes played by a celesta instead. Some composers, like Maurice Ravel, prefer the keyboard version of the instrument because it can produce a very loud and bright sound, perfect for climactic moments in orchestral music. In the 20th century, a company called Bergerault began manufacturing a three-octave mallet instrument with a foot pedal that can produce the wide range of notes required in modern scores. An asset class is a group of investments that have similar financial characteristics and behave similarly in the market. These investments can be divided into two categories: real assets and financial assets. While assets within the same asset class typically follow the same rules and regulations, this isn't always the case. For example, futures contracts based on an asset are considered part of the same asset class as the underlying asset, but they are subject to different regulations than the underlying asset. In music, accompaniment refers to the parts that provide rhythmic and harmonic support for the main melody or themes. There are many different styles and types of accompaniment in various genres and styles. In popular music and traditional music, the main approach used is called homophonic accompaniment, where a clear vocal melody is supported by subordinate chords. The accompaniment parts usually set the beat and outline the chord progression of the song or instrumental piece. The accompaniment can be played by a single musician on an instrument like piano, pipe organ, or guitar. While any instrument can be used, keyboard and guitar-family instruments are often chosen when there's only one instrument because they can play chords and basslines simultaneously more easily. A solo singer can also accompany themselves by playing guitar or piano while they sing, and in some cases, a singer can use their voice and body (like Bobby McFerrin) to create a unique accompaniment."}], "output": "  Sure, here's the answer to your question:\n\nApatim Majumdar plays the Sarod."},

It's part of the Olympic Games and World Championships in Athletics, and is typically held at high-level events. The race is 25 laps around an Olympic-sized track, which is why it's not as common at local track and field meetings because of its length. Unlike the 10K run, which is measured in kilometers, the 10,000 meters is measured in meters, which is why they're considered different events.

David was also a member of nine Canadian national track and field teams that competed in various international events, including the World University Games, the Commonwealth Games, and the Olympic Games. Throughout his career, David was recognized as a two-time Canadian Universities Track and Field Athlete of the Year (1965 and 1967) and was inducted into the University of Toronto Sports Hall of Fame twice (individually in 1998 and as a member of the team in 2003).   Nora Leticia Rocha de la Cruz was born on December 18, 1967, in Monclova, Coahuila, Mexico. She was a talented track and field athlete who specialized in the 5000 and 10,000 meters. At the 1999 Pan American Games in Winnipeg, Canada, Nora won the gold medal in the women's 10,000 meters race. The 2011 Pan American Games, which took place from October 14-30 in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, was a big multi-sport event that involved athletes from 42 countries. This was the largest multi-sport event of 2011, with around 6,000 athletes participating in 36 different sports. The event was organized by the Guadalajara 2011 Organizing Committee (COPAG).

UK. The magazine is known for its glossy pages and focuses on fashion, shopping, celebrity style, and real-life stories. The editor, Ali Hall, leads the team in bringing readers the latest trends and updates in the fashion world. Chrysalis: A Magazine of Women's Culture was a feminist publication that ran from 1977 to 1980. It was started by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie at the Woman's Building in Los Angeles. Chrysalis grew out of Grimstad and Rennie's work on self-help books, including The New Woman's Survival Catalog and The New Woman's Survival Sourcebook. What made Chrysalis unique was that it combined politics, literature, cultural studies, and art in a magazine that was produced through a collective process. This process was based on the feminist practice of consciousness-raising, which involved bringing people together to share their experiences and ideas. Chrysalis featured some of the most important thinkers and artists of the time, including Audre Lorde, Robin Morgan, Adrienne Rich, Marge Percy, Judy Chicago, Joanna Russ, Lucy Lippard, Mary Daly, Dolores Hayden, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn Hacker, Arlene Raven, and Elizabeth Janeway. Despite financial difficulties, the all-volunteer team produced ten issues over three years before the magazine had to stop publishing in 1981.In Malaysia, the first women's magazine was published in 1932. By the 2000s, there were almost 50 local women's magazines in the country, including those with an Islamic perspective. In addition, some international women's magazines are also published in Malaysia, such as Elle Malaysia, which was first published in March 2014, and Women's Health, which began in April 2015. These magazines join a list of other popular titles in the country, including comic and film magazines. In Austria, the magazine industry is largely influenced by Germany. However, this influence decreased in the late 1990s, but Germany still has an impact on women's and fashion magazines. Business magazines, on the other hand, are not as heavily influenced by Germany. The main categories of Austrian magazines are news, popular science, and special interest topics. Additionally, magazines play a significant role in the country's media landscape, as they are distinct from newspapers. The Transition House Association of Nova Scotia (THANS) is a non-profit organization based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. They run women's shelters and provide support services for women and children affected by domestic violence. Pamela Harrison is the executive director of THANS and also serves as the provincial coordinator. Rhonda Fraser, the executive director of Chrysalis House, is a member of THANS. Every year, THANS organizes an event called the Purple Ribbon Awareness Campaign to remember the École Polytechnique massacre. THANS was founded in 1989 and has conducted research on the experiences of physically abused women who have sought legal mediation. In 2000, THANS released a report based on these interviews, which found that most of the women would not recommend legal mediation to other abused women. In 2008, THANS supported a bill called the Domestic Violence Elimination Act, but it was not passed. In 2009, the leader of the New Democratic Party in Nova Scotia promised to increase funding for halfway houses for women leaving abusive relationships. In 2012, THANS partnered with other organizations to host a ballet performance in Halifax to raise awareness about domestic violence. Lifestyle magazines are a type of publication that cover a wide range of topics related to daily life, such as fashion, health, fitness, travel, and culture. The term lifestyle magazine is used to describe a magazine that has a particular tone or focus, rather than a specific topic. So, it can include magazines aimed at men, women, or a general audience, as well as publications that focus on specific interests like fitness, decorating, or cultural events. In general, the term lifestyle magazine is used to describe a magazine that aims to provide readers with information and inspiration on how to live their best life. A customer magazine is a publication created by a business to communicate with its customers. It's a type of media called custom media, which is similar to a newsstand or consumer magazine but is partially funded by the business. The main goal of a customer magazine is to achieve a specific business objective, such as selling more products or promoting a brand. In-flight magazines, which are provided by airlines, are an example of customer magazines. Many supermarkets in the UK now publish their own customer magazines to promote their products through recipes and other food-related content. Some customer magazines also include advertising, which can help offset the costs of producing the magazine while also making it more similar to a traditional magazine. Rick Wilber is a prolific American author, poet, and editor who has made a significant impact in the science fiction and fantasy genres. He has published over thirty-five short stories in various magazines, including Aboriginal SF, Analog, Asimov's Science Fiction, Fantasy & Science Fiction, Pulphouse, and SF Age. In addition to his short story publications, Rick has written several novels, including Rum Point, The Cold Road, and Alien Morning, as well as a memoir called My Father's Game: Life, Death, Baseball. He has also authored several textbooks, such as Modern Media Writing and Magazine Feature Writing. In Portugal, most magazines are focused on women's interests, society, and TV culture. According to data from 1994, there were almost 984 magazines in the country that year. Surfer hair is a popular hairstyle that originated in the 1950s and has been around ever since. Traditionally, surfer hair is long, thick, and naturally lightened from exposure to the sun and salt water. In the 1960s and 1970s, the long hair and lack of personal grooming became associated with the hippie movement. Today, companies sell special hair products to help people achieve the surfer look, with shorter hairstyles that require more maintenance to keep looking messy and windswept. Some fashion magazines have even called sun-streaked surfer hair a desirable look for women, although real surfer hair can be damaged from the elements."}], "output": "  Chrysalis and Look are both women's magazines.\n\nChrysalis was a feminist publication that ran from 1977 to 1980, combining politics, literature, cultural studies, and art in a magazine produced through a collective process based on the feminist practice of consciousness-raising.

He was a highly influential thinker in the early 20th century and continued to be significant after World War II in the field of continental philosophy. Bergson's ideas had a significant impact on many areas of philosophy, including metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics. Thomas Friedman is a well-known American journalist and author, born on July 20, 1953. He has won the Pulitzer Prize three times, which is a prestigious award in the field of journalism.Henri Bergson's 1903 essay Introduction to Metaphysics explores his idea of reality. Bergson believed that reality is not made up of separate, distinct states, but rather it's a continuous process, similar to the way process philosophy or the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus saw it. Our understanding of reality can't be reduced to simple analysis, as it's constantly changing and can't be fully understood from one perspective alone. Instead, we need to use intuition to fully grasp reality, which Bergson described as immersing ourselves in the object itself. Henri Bergson, a French philosopher, developed a theory of time and consciousness called duration (French: la durée). Bergson felt that earlier philosophers, like Herbert Spencer, didn't fully grasp the nature of time and consciousness. Bergson believed that time is different from what math and science can measure, because it's always changing and can't be captured in a single, fixed moment. For example, when you try to measure a moment, it's already passed. Time is like a moving, incomplete line, and this realization led Bergson to explore the inner workings of the human mind, which he called duration. Duration is a complex and difficult-to-describe concept, and Bergson believed that it could only be understood through a simple intuition of the imagination. Images and ideas can't fully capture the essence of duration, but they can give us a glimpse into its mysterious nature.   Samuel Eliot Morison was a renowned American historian known for his works on maritime and American history. He was born on July 9, 1887, and passed away on May 15, 1976. Morison received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1912 and taught history there for 40 years. He was awarded two Pulitzer Prizes, one for his book Admiral of the Ocean Sea (1942) and the other for John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography (1959). In 1942, Morison was commissioned to write a history of United States naval operations in World War II, which was published in 15 volumes between 1947 and 1962. He also wrote the popular Oxford History of the American People (1965) and co-authored the classic textbook The Growth of the American Republic (1930) with Henry Steele Commager. Throughout his distinguished career, Morison received numerous honors, including eleven honorary doctoral degrees, multiple literary prizes, military honors, and national awards from both the United States and foreign countries. The 2011 Pulitzer Prizes were awarded on April 18, 2011. The Los Angeles Times won two prizes, including the most prestigious award for Public Service. The New York Times also won two awards. Unfortunately, no prize was given in the Breaking News category. The Wall Street Journal won an award for the first time since 2007. Writer Jennifer Egan won the Fiction prize for her novel A Visit From the Goon Squad, which had already won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 2010. Carol Guzy, a photographer for The Washington Post, became the first journalist to win four Pulitzer Prizes. Henri Bergson, a French philosopher, introduced the term élan vital in his 1907 book Creative Evolution. This term refers to the idea that things in the universe are becoming more complex and organized in a spontaneous and self-organized manner. Bergson believed that élan vital was the key to understanding the evolution and development of living organisms, and he linked it closely with consciousness and the way we experience time. While some people translate élan vital as vital impetus, others call it vital force. However, Bergson's detractors have challenged the idea of élan vital as a valid explanation for evolution and development. Henri Bergson's doctoral thesis, Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness, published in 1889, tackles the long-standing philosophical debate over free will. Bergson argues that many philosophers have misunderstood the concept of free will due to a misleading translation of unrelated ideas into related ones. He proposes his own theory of duration, which would go on to influence many continental philosophers in the following century. In essence, Bergson claims that free will is not what it seems, and his essay aims to shed light on this confusion and introduce his groundbreaking theory.   Moina Mathers, born Mina Bergson (February 28, 1865 – July 25, 1928), was an artist and occultist during the early 20th century. She was the sister of French philosopher Henri Bergson, who became the first man of Jewish descent to win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927. While she is well-known for her marriage to Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, a co-founder of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, an occult organization, she is also renowned for leading a successor organization called the Rosicrucian Order of the Alpha et Omega after her husband's death in 1918. Henri Bergson's book Matter and Memory (French title: Matière et mémoire) was published in 1896. The subtitle of the book is Essay on the relation of body and spirit (Essai sur la relation du corps à l'esprit). In this book, Bergson analyzes the long-standing philosophical question of how the body and spirit are related. To help answer this question, he focuses on the role of memory. Bergson was responding to a book called The Maladies of Memory by Théodule Ribot, which was published in 1881. Ribot argued that scientific discoveries about the brain showed that memory is located in a specific part of the nervous system and is therefore material in nature. Bergson disagreed with this reductionist view and believed that memory is deeply spiritual and cannot be reduced to material processes. He argued that the brain serves a practical function by inserting relevant memories into the present moment, but that memories are not erased by brain damage. Instead, the memories are still present but cannot be accessed."}], "output": "  Thomas Friedman has won more Pulitzer Prizes than Henri Bergson.

The song was sent to country radio stations in the US on November 15, 2010, as the second single from the album. Swift revealed that Back to December is the first time she has apologized to someone in a song. Critics believe the song is about her ex-boyfriend Taylor Lautner, who later confirmed the rumor. Back to December is a country pop ballad with an orchestral sound, and its lyrics express a heartfelt apology for ending a relationship. Yoann Lemoine was born on March 16, 1983, and is a talented French music video director, graphic designer, and singer-songwriter. Some of his most notable works include directing music videos for popular artists such as Katy Perry (for the song Teenage Dream), Taylor Swift (for the song Back to December), Lana Del Rey (for the songs Born to Die and Mystery Jets for the song Dreaming of Another World).Lana Del Rey released her second EP, called Lana Del Rey, in January 2012 in the United States and Canada through Interscope Records. This EP was her third musical release after two unsuccessful attempts - an EP called Kill Kill in 2008 and a studio album called Lana Del Ray in 2010. The EP features four songs that showcase her unique blend of indie pop, hip hop, and alternative music. Lana Del Rey wrote the lyrics and melody for the songs, along with her collaborators Patrik Berger and Justin Parker. Emile Haynie, who also co-wrote the hit song Blue Jeans, led the production of the EP. Lana Del Rey, the American singer-songwriter, released a song called Kill Kill in 2008 under her stage name Lizzy Grant. The song was later re-released in 2010 under the same title. Grant, who is now well-known as Lana Del Rey, first released Kill Kill on October 21, 2008, as part of a three-track extended play with the same name. The song was later included on her debut album, which was released under the name Lana Del Rey A.K.A. Lizzy Grant, or simply Lana Del Rey. Lana Del Rey's song Video Games was released in 2011 as part of her second studio album and major label debut, Born to Die. The song was first shared online on June 29, 2011, and later appeared on her EP Lana Del Rey. It was then re-released as the lead single from her second album in October 2011 through Interscope Records. The song was produced by Robopop and written by Del Rey and Justin Parker. Video Games is a slow and emotional ballad that tells the story of a woman who tries to win back her lover's attention despite being ignored by him. Lana Del Rey's debut album, also known as Lizzy Grant, was released digitally through iTunes in 2010. However, the album was removed from stores soon after its release because the record label couldn't afford to fund it. Lana Del Rey, who was then known as Lana Del Ray, bought back the rights to the album, which features an alternate spelling of her stage name. After releasing her successful album Born to Die under her stage name Lana Del Rey, she expressed her desire to re-release her debut album using the original spelling of her stage name, Del Rey. Lana Del Rey's song Blue Jeans was released in 2012 as the third single from her second studio album, Born to Die. The song was produced by Emile Haynie and written by Del Rey, Haynie, and Dan Heath. It's a slow and emotional ballad with elements of hip hop, and it caused some controversy when Del Rey performed it on Saturday Night Live (SNL). The song became popular in some European and Asian countries, like Belgium, Poland, and Israel, and there were two music videos made for it. The first video was self-produced by Del Rey, and the second was directed by Yoann Lemoine and features film noir-style elements and crocodiles. Lana Del Rey's song Yayo is a hit track that appears on several of her albums, including her first extended play, Kill Kill, her debut album, Lana Del Ray, and her third EP, Paradise. After the release of her third EP, the song became popular in France and received widespread critical acclaim. Many reviewers praised Del Rey's vocal performance and the song's catchy melody, calling it one of her best works. It's worth noting that Del Rey produced a self-made music video for Yayo before signing with a major record label. The original version of the song was released through 5 Point Records and was produced by David Kahne, who later remastered it with Emile Haynie and Dan Heath. Lana Del Rey, the American singer and actress, has had a diverse career in film and television.

The church was originally part of a monastery dedicated to Christ Pantepoptes, which means Christ the All-Seeing. This is the only remaining 11th-century church in Istanbul that is still intact, and it's an important example of middle Byzantine architecture. Unfortunately, this historic building is one of the least studied in the city. The Nusretiye Clock Tower, also known as the Tophane Clock Tower, is located in the Tophane neighborhood of Istanbul's Beyoğlu district, next to the Nusretiye Mosque and Tophane Kiosk along the European shore of the Bosphorus. This clock tower was commissioned by Sultan Abdülmecid I of the Ottoman Empire (1823-1861) and designed by architect Garabet Amira Balyan. It was completed in 1848.The Clock Tower, also known as the Jubilee Clock Tower, is a freestanding clock tower located in the center of Brighton, part of the English city of Brighton and Hove. It was built in 1888 to commemorate Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee and features innovative structural elements that make it stand out. Over the years, the tower has become a well-known landmark in the popular and fashionable seaside resort, and the people of Brighton hold a special affection for it, even though opinions on its architectural beauty are divided. The clock tower has been designated as a Grade II listed building by English Heritage for its historical and architectural significance. The Galle Clock Tower, also known as the Anthonisz Memorial Clock Tower, is situated within the Galle Fort in Galle, Sri Lanka. This iconic landmark overlooks the central Moon Bastion, which was once the site of the guard room. The clock tower was built in 1883 and was funded by public subscriptions from the people of Galle as a tribute to Dr. P. D. Anthonisz. The clock itself was a generous gift from a grateful patient, Mudaliyar Samson de Abrew Rajapakse. On June 22, 1954, the foundation stone of this impressive mosque was laid in a religious ceremony. This day also happened to be the birthday of Ali al-Ridha, the eighth Imam of Shia Islam. The mosque was finally completed in 1961, and it was built based on Islamic architectural principles. The mosque has four large prayer halls and three balconies, with a large dome that measures 30 meters in diameter and 15 meters high above the roof. The minarets of the mosque are 25 meters long and 45 meters high from the basement, with an upper section that is 5 meters tall. The mosque also has a special section used for calling the faithful to prayer (A'zaan) and a tall clock tower with a big clock that can be seen from all sides of the mosque. The Birgu Clock Tower, also known as the Vittoriosa Clock Tower or Civic Clock Tower, was a historic clock tower located in Victory Square of Birgu, Malta. This iconic landmark was built in the Middle Ages, although some sources suggest it was constructed in 1549. Its strategic location offered panoramic views of the Grand Harbour and the surrounding countryside, making it an ideal watchtower. During the Great Siege of Malta in 1565, the tower saw significant use. In the 17th century, a clock was installed in the tower, adding to its functionality and making it an even more prominent feature in the city's landscape. Tashkyopryu Mosque is a historic mosque located in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, built by the Ottoman Turks in the 16th century during their 500-year rule over the region. Today, it is the third functioning mosque in Plovdiv, after Dzhumaya Mosque and Imaret Mosque.

The Kumanovo Clock Tower (Macedonian: Саат Кула Куманово) was a clock tower located in Kumanovo, which was part of the Ottoman Empire (now the Republic of Macedonia) during the 18th century. While there are limited historical records, it is believed that the tower existed during this time period. It was situated near the former Eski Mosque in the Orta Bunar Neighborhood (Macedonian: Орта Bunар Маало). Unfortunately, the clock tower was demolished after the Second World War. The Hysen Pasha Mosque, also known as the Clock Mosque (Xhamia e Sahatit), is a cultural monument in Albania located in the city of Berat. It was built in 1670 by Hussein Pasha, and its name comes from the clock tower that was added next to it in 1870 by the Ottomans. Unfortunately, the clock tower was destroyed in 1967 during the Communist dictatorship. The mosque itself was also damaged, with only the minaret remaining intact. After the end of Communism, the mosque was restored and renovated. The Clock Tower of Murshidabad, also known as Big Ben of Murshidabad, is located within the Nizamat Fort Campus in West Bengal, India.

These stores don't require membership fees and have shelves stocked with products in high volumes. When you enter the store, you're led on a logical journey around the store to the checkout area. As you walk in, you're greeted with discounted special buys. Then, you'll find the produce section, followed by the deli at the back of the store. Other departments like the bakery are also included. One of the unique features of these stores is that customers bag their own groceries, which helps reduce costs. Some large grocery chains operate warehouse stores to attract price-conscious customers and maximize their buying power. Examples of such chains include Kroger and Albertsons in the US, while WinCo Foods is a standalone warehouse chain. Unlike other supermarkets like A&P, Safeway, Kroger, or Supervalu, WinCo Foods operates independently. FedMart was a discount department store chain started by Sol Price in San Diego, California.

Berea College is a unique liberal arts college located in Berea, Kentucky. It's situated in Madison County, about 35 miles south of Lexington. Founded in 1855, Berea College stands out among other colleges for two main reasons: it provides free education to its students, and it was the first college in the South to be coeducational and racially integrated. What's even more remarkable is that Berea College doesn't charge tuition. In fact, every student who gets admitted receives a four-year scholarship worth $97,200 ($24,300 per year).Altruism is a moral philosophy that values the well-being of others above one's own well-being. This ethical belief holds that the moral goodness of an action depends solely on how it affects other people, regardless of how it affects the individual performing the action. In other words, an action is considered moral if it benefits everyone else more than it benefits the individual.\n\nThere are different versions of altruism, as described by philosophers James Fieser and Auguste Comte. Fieser's version of altruism is summarized in the altruist dictum, which states that an action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable to everyone else than to the individual themselves. Comte's version of altruism, on the other hand, involves living one's life for the benefit of others. People who follow this ethical belief are called altruists. Alice Lloyd College is a four-year liberal arts college located in Pippa Passes, Kentucky. It was founded in 1923 by two women, Alice Spencer Geddes Lloyd and June Buchanan, who were both from out-of-state.

The college became a four-year degree-granting institution in the 1980s and is now accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Work colleges are special liberal arts colleges in the United States that blend work, learning, and service. At these colleges, all students work regardless of their major or financial situation. This means that students from all backgrounds work together to contribute to the college community. Unlike Federal Work Study, which only considers financial need, work colleges don't differentiate between students who can afford to pay for their education and those who can't. In other words, everyone works. Students are evaluated on their work performance and can be dismissed if they don't meet standards. They can't just pay their way out of the work requirement. By working on campus, students gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their community. This makes the college more efficient and lean, which helps keep tuition costs lower. Liberal arts colleges are schools that focus on undergraduate studies in the arts and humanities. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica Concise, the term liberal arts refers to a college or university curriculum that aims to provide a broad education and develop general intellectual abilities, as opposed to a curriculum that focuses on a specific profession or technical skills. Although the concept of liberal arts colleges originated in Europe, the term is often associated with the United States. Today, liberal arts colleges can be found all over the world, and there are many institutions outside of the US that offer programs in liberal arts education. Check out the list (link) for a list of international members of the Association of American Colleges and Universities, which includes other institutions that offer liberal arts programs. A liberal arts college is a type of college that focuses on undergraduate studies in the arts and sciences.

This means that students will study a variety of subjects, including science, humanities, and other academic areas, in addition to their major field of study. While the concept of a liberal arts college has its roots in Europe, it is particularly associated with American higher education and is now found around the world with variations based on the American model.

In 1960, a declaration was made in the Privy Council that established the use of this surname for male-line descendants of the Queen, without any royal titles or styles. However, some descendants of the Queen who hold royal titles may choose to use the Mountbatten-Windsor surname in certain situations where a surname is required. The Mountbatten family is a European royal dynasty that originated as a branch of the German princely Battenberg family. During World War I, some members of the family living in the United Kingdom changed their name to Mountbatten because of growing anti-German sentiment among the British public. The name Mountbatten is actually an English version of the German name Battenberg, which comes from a small town in Hesse, Germany. In the 19th century, a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt (which is a smaller branch of the House of Hesse) was granted the title of count of Battenberg, later changing to prince of Battenberg.The Zulu royal family includes King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, who is the ruler of the Zulus in South Africa, as well as other close relatives and descendants of his great-grandfather, King Mpande. King Mpande was the half-brother of King Shaka, who was a powerful leader who expanded the Zulu kingdom and made it one of the most influential pre-colonial realms in South Africa. King Shaka's policies and conquests helped create the large and powerful Zulu kingdom that exists today. In history and heraldry, a cadet branch refers to the male descendants of a monarch or patriarch's younger sons. In many European and Asian royal families and noble households, the family's wealth, titles, lands, and other assets have traditionally been passed down from the father to his eldest son. However, the younger sons, known as cadets, received less inheritance and had fewer opportunities to pass on their wealth and status to future generations. The Capetian dynasty, also known as the House of France, was founded by Hugh Capet and is one of the largest and oldest royal families in Europe and the world. This dynasty includes all of Hugh Capet's male descendants. From 987 until 1328, the senior line of the Capetian dynasty ruled France as the House of Capet. After their death, cadet branches of the family, such as the Houses of Valois and Bourbon, took over the rule of France until the French Revolution. In Georgia, Batonishvili is a title for royal princes and princesses who come from the Bagrationi dynasty. It means child of batoni, which is the Georgian word for lord or sovereign. The title is added to the names of these royal descendants, such as Alexandre Batonishvili, Ioane Batonishvili, and Nino Batonishvili. Originally, only the children of the current king (known as mepe) could use this title, but later it was also given to all male-line descendants of past kings. The customary way to address a Batonishvili is with the title უგანათლებულესი (uganatlebulesi), which means Most Brilliant or Most High. The House of Capet, also known as the Direct Capetians or the House of France, ruled the Kingdom of France from 987 to 1328. This was the most important branch of the Capetian dynasty, which was itself a branch of the larger Robertians. In the 19th century, historians started calling the ruling house of France Capetian and also referred to the broader group of male-line descendants of Hugh Capet as Capetians. This term wasn't used at the time, however. The Capetians are sometimes referred to as the third race of kings, with the Merovingians being the first and the Carolingians being the second. The name Capetian comes from the nickname of Hugh Capet, the first Capetian king. The title of Duke of Leuchtenberg was created twice by the monarchs of Bavaria for their relatives. The first creation was made by Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria, and given to his son Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus. When Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus died without children, the lands went back to his nephew, Elector Maximilian II. Later, Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria, re-created the title on November 14, 1817, and gave it to his son-in-law, Eugène de Beauharnais. Eugène was the adopted stepson of the deposed Emperor Napoleon I of France and had been his heir in Frankfurt and briefly in Italy. To compensate Eugène for losing his other titles, King Maximilian Joseph named him the heir to the kingdom after the male-line descendants of the royal house and next in line after the royal family. The House of Windsor is the royal family of the Commonwealth realms, and it includes the male descendants of Queen Victoria who are subjects of the Crown, as well as the male descendants of Elizabeth II. According to two Orders-in-Council from 1917 and 1952, male-line descendants of the royal family lose their last name Windsor upon marriage. During the Muhammad Ali dynasty, which ruled Egypt from 1805 to 1953, the line of succession to the throne went through some changes over time. Initially, the dynasty followed the traditional practice of the Ottoman Empire, where the oldest son inherited the throne. However, in 1866, the ruling Khedive of Egypt, Isma'il Pasha, obtained a special decree from the Ottoman Emperor that limited the line of succession to only the male descendants of Isma'il Pasha. This rule remained in place until the monarchy was abolished in 1953, following the Egyptian Revolution that year."}], "output": "  The Mountbatten-Windsor surname applies to male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, who are part of the European royal dynasty known as the House of Windsor."},

It's made up of three ancient kingdoms: Mide, Osraige, and Leinster. After the Norman invasion of Ireland in the 12th century, the areas of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the influence of the Pale, which stretched across both regions. This formed the modern-day province of Leinster. In the past, the kingdoms were divided into counties for administrative and legal purposes. Over time, local government laws have further divided these historic counties.   Patrick Kennedy was an Irish folklorist who lived in County Wexford from early 1801 until his death on March 29, 1873. He was a bookseller by profession, but he is famous for collecting and preserving Irish folktales, particularly those from the Leinster region. These tales are told in a simple, rustic style that reflects the language and dialect of the Irish peasants who lived in the anglicized part of Ireland known as The Pale. Kennedy is credited with preserving many Irish idioms and phrases in his writing, as well as the unique sentence structures and vocabulary of the Irish people.Seumas MacManus was a talented Irish author, playwright, and poet who lived from 1867 to 1960.

Jack and His Comrades is a classic Irish fairy tale about a young man named Jack who, with the help of his animal friends, achieves great success. This story was collected by folklorist Patrick Kennedy from a resident of County Wexford, Ireland, and was first published in a book called Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts in 1866. Later, the story was slightly revised and reprinted by Joseph Jacobs in his collection of Celtic fairy tales. Amy Corzine is a talented American writer who has written both fiction and non-fiction works, including poetry. Her first book was a travel guide to Ireland for families called Cadogan's Ireland, where she incorporated her own stories based on Irish folktales.

They play in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League and were founded in 1880. The club started in west Belfast at Grosvenor Park, but moved to a new home in Ballyskeagh in 1971. They played at Skegoneill Avenue and Seaview for a few years before settling at their current stadium in 1980. The club used to be called Distillery, but changed its name to Lisburn Distillery in 1999 to show their connection to the city of Lisburn. The club's colors are white. Lisburn Distillery is a founding member of the Irish League from 1890, but was relegated in May 2013. Sean Connor was born on July 12, 1967, and is a former professional footballer and manager.

Football Club, also known as Newington Youth Club or Newington F.C., is an intermediate-level football club in Northern Ireland that plays in the NIFL Premier Intermediate League. The club is based in the Newington area of Belfast, but due to a lack of facilities for junior and intermediate clubs in north Belfast, they have played their home matches at different locations such as Muckamore Park in Antrim, Brantwood FC on Skegoneill Avenue, Richardson Park in Dunmurry, and The Cliff in Larne. In 2008, the club formed a partnership with the IFA Premiership club Crusaders, with the goal of securing funding for a new, shared ground in north Belfast. As part of the partnership, Newington used Crusaders' current ground, Seaview, as their home venue in the 2008-09 season, which marked a return to playing home matches in their native north Belfast. For the 2013-14 season, Seaview will again be Newington's home ground in the NIFL Championship 2 league. The NIFL Premier Intermediate League is the third division of the Northern Ireland Football League, which is the top-level league in Northern Ireland for association football (soccer). This league is considered the highest intermediate division in Northern Ireland and sits at level three in the overall football league system of the country, below the top two divisions. The Northern Ireland Intermediate League is an amateur league based in the north-west region of Northern Ireland. It's in the fourth tier of Northern Irish football, which means it's one of the lower-level leagues.

He is the son of Montague and his wife, and he secretly falls in love with and marries Juliet, a member of the rival Capulet family. After Romeo kills Juliet's cousin Tybalt in a duel, he is forced to leave Verona and believes Juliet is dead, leading him to take his own life. In the play Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare, Benvolio is a fictional character who is related to both Romeo and Montague. He is Montague's nephew and Romeo's cousin, which means they are close family. Benvolio tries to be a peacekeeper in the play by trying to stop the violence between the Capulet and Montague families, but he's not successful.In William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Prince Hamlet is the main character and protagonist. He is the prince of Denmark and the nephew of King Claudius, who murdered his father, the previous king of Denmark. At the start of the play, Hamlet struggles with deciding how to avenge his father's death, and he also struggles with his own mental health. As the play progresses, Hamlet's actions lead to the deaths of several characters, including Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern. He also indirectly causes the deaths of his loved ones, such as Ophelia (by drowning) and his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius accidentally). Macbeth, also known as The Tragedy of Macbeth, is a play by William Shakespeare that was likely performed in 1606. The play explores the harmful effects of ambition on individuals who seek power for its own sake. Among the plays Shakespeare wrote during the reign of King James I, who was also the patron of Shakespeare's acting company, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign. The play was first published in 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. In early modern England, a popular genre of plays was called revenge tragedy or tragedy of blood. This genre was first defined by Ashley H. Thorndike in his 1902 article The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays. According to Thorndike, a revenge tragedy is a play where the main character seeks revenge for a past wrong, and the play follows the progress of this revenge until it leads to the death of the murderers and sometimes the death of the avenger.\n\nThomas Kyd's play The Spanish Tragedy, written in the 1580s, is often considered the first revenge tragedy on the early modern stage. However, research has shown that the genre actually began earlier, in the 1560s, with translations of ancient Greek plays by poet and classicist Jasper Heywood at Oxford University. Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's Hamlet and Titus Andronicus, and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy. William Shakespeare's plays are often categorized into five genres: Shakespearean tragedy, history, romance, problem play, and comedy. Shakespearean tragedies are his plays that have this label, and many of his history plays share the qualities of a Shakespearean tragedy. However, these history plays are based on real figures from English history, so they were classified as histories in the First Folio. On the other hand, Shakespeare's Roman tragedies (such as Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus) are based on historical figures from foreign and ancient times, so they are typically classified as tragedies rather than histories.\n\nShakespeare's later plays, known as romances, are a mix of tragedy and comedy. They feature a high-status central character, but they end happily, like a comedy. Scholars still debate how to classify some of Shakespeare's plays, as their subject matter, setting, or ending don't fit neatly into a single category. This is why F.S. Boas, a scholar several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, coined the term problem play to describe these plays. Rory Williams is a character in the popular British sci-fi TV series Doctor Who, played by actor Arthur Darvill. He first joins the show in Series 5, accompanying the Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) as a companion. Initially, Rory is insecure about his relationship with Amy Pond, the Doctor's companion, as he believes she has feelings for the Doctor more than him. However, he later proves to be a hero and the two get married. They even have a child together while traveling through time in the TARDIS, but their baby is kidnapped immediately after birth. Later in the series, Rory and Amy discover that their friend River Song is actually their daughter, and the Doctor and River get married. As a result, Rory becomes the Doctor's son-in-law. Romeo and Juliet is a 1954 film adaptation of William Shakespeare's famous play. The movie was directed by Renato Castellani and features Laurence Harvey as Romeo, Susan Shentall as Juliet, Flora Robson as the Nurse, Mervyn Johns as Friar Lawrence, Bill Travers as Benvolio, Sebastian Cabot as Lord Capulet, Ubaldo Zollo as Mercutio, Enzo Fiermonte as Tybalt, and John Gielgud as the Chorus. In William Shakespeare's famous play Romeo and Juliet, Juliet Capulet (also known as Giulietta Capuleti) is the main female character. She is the only daughter of the head of the Capulet family, and she falls in love with Romeo, a member of the Montague family who are enemies of the Capulets. The story of Romeo and Juliet has been told and retold for centuries before Shakespeare even wrote his play, and it has become a classic tale of star-crossed lovers. Anna Devane is a fictional character from the ABC soap operas General Hospital and All My Children. Finola Hughes played the role of Anna on both shows. Anna first appeared on General Hospital on April 10, 1985, as a mysterious person who turned out to be Robert Scorpio's ex-wife and a skilled spy. The character was created by the show's executive producer, Gloria Monty, and co-head writers, Pat Falken Smith and Norma Monty. Anna's introduction sparked a romantic triangle between her, Robert, and his current wife, Holly Sutton. Anna remained a key character in the series until 1992, with storylines involving her past as a spy and her relationships with Robert and former mobster Duke Lavery. Tragically, Duke died in Anna's arms, but Robert and Anna eventually reunited and raised their daughter, Robin, before remarrying. Unfortunately, their happiness was short-lived, as they were killed off in 1992 along with their rival, Cesar Faison."}], "output": "  The character who slays Benvolio in William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet is Romeo Montague."},

The Flowers of Romance were a punk band formed in 1976 by Jo Faull and Sarah Hall. Despite never playing live or releasing any recordings, the band became famous for the number of well-known musicians who were later members, including Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, Keith Levene of The Clash and Public Image Ltd, and Palmolive and Viv Albertine of The Slits. Despite never performing live, the band was interviewed by a fanzine called SKUM, in which Sid Vicious said, I'll just be the yob that I am now.Glen Matlock is a well-known English musician who was born on August 27, 1956. He's most famous for being a founding member of the punk rock band the Sex Pistols, where he played bass guitar. Matlock is sometimes credited as a co-writer on 10 of the 12 songs on the band's album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, even though he had left the band by the time the record was released and Steve Jones played bass instead. Despite leaving the Sex Pistols, Matlock continues to make his own music and tour with various bands, including the Sex Pistols. The Avengers' live album, Live at Winterland 1978, was released on February 16, 2010, through online music stores. This album features a recording of their live performance on January 14, 1978 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, California, when they supported the Sex Pistols on what turned out to be the Sex Pistols' final show before their reunion years later. The Sex Pistols' set from that night has also been released on an album with the same name. Some of the songs from this album were previously released on two bootlegs titled Penelope and Summer of Hate. The concert album The Idols with Sid Vicious features former Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious performing with the band The Idols. Although the album was recorded in September 1978, it wasn't released until 1993. A recording of this performance was provided by Steve Dior to the New Rose record label. Initially, the album was released by New Rose's Fan Club division, but it was also released in Japan by Teichiku Records under license from New Rose. The song Bodies by the Sex Pistols, released in 1977 on their album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, is a powerful and controversial track. The lyrics are graphic and feature profanity, including the word fuck repeated five times in quick succession in the third and final verse. This song, along with another track called Belsen Was a Gas, is among the most explicit and heavy in the Sex Pistols' discography. Musically, Bodies is characterized by fast and heavy drumming, distorted guitar, and shouted vocals, making it a significant influence on the emergence of hardcore, thrash, and speed metal genres in the 1980s. Nancy Spungen was an American woman who was the girlfriend of Sid Vicious, the bassist of the famous punk rock band the Sex Pistols. She was a key figure in the 1970s punk rock scene, but her life and death have been the subject of debate among music historians and fans of the Sex Pistols. The Ex Pistols were a fake band created in 1979 by Dave Goodman, a producer who had worked with the Sex Pistols in the past. Goodman's intention was to trick fans by creating a band that sounded like the Sex Pistols, had the same name and artwork, and even released music that was meant to be mistaken for new or lost recordings by the real band. In other words, the Ex Pistols were a scam act designed to deceive people into thinking they were listening to genuine Sex Pistols music. The song Revolution by the Ex Pistols has nothing to do with the Sex Pistols, despite its misleading packaging. It was released in 1989 on the STP Records label and comes in different colors of vinyl. The song, along with its B-side Schools Are Prisons, were included on the Ex-Pistols album Deny. They were also featured on two retrospective Sex Pistols albums produced by former producer Dave Goodman, Pirates of Destiny (1989) and We Have Cum For Your Children (1988). Interestingly, a re-recorded version of Revolution was included on a German Sex Pistols compilation album called Anarchy in the USA in 1992, released on MBC records. The Swindle Continues is the first album released by the Ex Pistols in 1988. It's interesting because it's a mix of songs from both the Sex Pistols and the Ex Pistols. This is the only Ex Pistols album that doesn't pretend to be completely by the Sex Pistols - it's a unique blend of both groups' material."}], "output": "  The fanzine that interviewed Sid Vicious when he was in the band The Flowers of Romance was SKUM."},

They are similar to the hormone testosterone, which is already in the body. There are two types of anabolic steroids: natural ones, like testosterone, and synthetic ones that are made in a lab and have similar effects to testosterone. These steroids help build muscle, especially in the muscles of the body, and also have effects on other parts of the body, like the voice and body hair. The term anabolic comes from the Greek word anabole, which means something that is thrown up or built up. Anabolic steroids are one of three types of hormone agonists, which means they act like other hormones in the body. The other two types are estrogens (like estradiol) and progestogens (like progesterone). Anabolic steroids are drugs that are made from the male hormone testosterone. They're used for building muscle and getting stronger, both for cosmetic reasons and to improve athletic performance. These drugs work in several ways, including increasing the amount of protein built in muscles and stopping the process of breaking down muscle tissue for energy. Many teens and adults use steroids because they help muscles grow faster than they would on their own.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.Docking is the intentional removal of a part of an animal's body, usually the tail or ears. The term cropping is often used to refer to the removal of ears, while docking is used more commonly to refer to the removal of tails. Some people also use the term tailing to describe this process. The term dock refers to the living flesh on an animal's tail where the tail hairs grow, so docking can also mean removing this flesh. Tensile testing, also known as tension testing, is a fundamental test used in materials science to evaluate the properties of a material under tension. In this test, a sample is stretched until it breaks, and the results are used to determine its strength, elasticity, and other important properties. The test measures the ultimate tensile strength, maximum elongation, and reduction in area of the material. These measurements can also provide information on other properties, such as Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, and how the material responds to different levels of stretching. The most common type of tensile testing is uniaxial tensile testing, which is used for isotropic materials. For materials that have different properties in different directions, such as composite materials and textiles, biaxial tensile testing is required. A STOLport (Short Take-Off and Landing airport) was designed specifically for aircraft of a certain size and weight to take off and land safely, even with shorter runways. The term STOLport wasn't widely used in 2008, but pilots flying into Biggin Hill Airport in the UK during 1986-87 used it when referring to the airport due to restrictions on approaches and ceilings from the nearby London City Airport. A STOLport typically has a short (less than 5,000 feet) single runway and can only accommodate certain types of aircraft, usually smaller propeller planes with fuel limits. In the US, short runway facilities are just called airports, and the term STOLport hasn't been commonly used since the 1970s. Trickle valves, also known as vacuum valves, are commonly used in industrial dust collection systems to keep a hopper sealed while allowing bulk solid material to be automatically discharged. These valves are a cost-effective alternative to rotary airlocks, which require an external power source. Unlike rotary airlocks, trickle valves don't need any electricity to operate, making them ideal for use in mechanical trenchers where a dust-free environment is crucial for smooth operation. Trickle valves were specifically designed for this purpose. Methyltestosterone (brand names Agovirin, Android, Metandren, Oreton, Testred, Virilon, and others) is a synthetic drug that's similar to the natural hormone testosterone. It's used to treat men who have low levels of testosterone, and it's also used for other purposes like improving muscle mass and performance in athletes and bodybuilders. The drug was created in 1935, just after testosterone was discovered, and it's one of the first synthetic anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) to be developed. Although it's not as popular as some other AAS, methyltestosterone is still used by doctors today. The Belling-Lee connector, also known as IEC 61169-2 type 9,52, is a common radio-frequency coaxial connector used in Europe and Australia for connecting coaxial cables and various devices such as TV antennas, amplifiers, CATV distribution systems, TV sets, and FM and DAB radio receivers. This connector has been around for a while and is still widely used in many consumer devices. Metandienone, also known as Averbol, Dianabol, Danabol, Metanabol, Naposim, and Vetanabol, is a synthetic anabolic steroid that was once used in medicine but has since been discontinued in most countries. It's a modified version of testosterone, specifically a 17α-methylated derivative. Additionally, it's commonly referred to as methandrostenolone. Metandienone has also been used non-medically as a performance-enhancing drug. Pox is a traditional liquor used by the Mayans of Mexico and Central America for ceremonial purposes. It's made from corn, sugar cane, and wheat, which are important in Mayan culture. Pox is also known as aguardiente, and it's not only used for religious ceremonies but also enjoyed as a popular alcoholic drink in the Chiapas region of southern Mexico. In Tzotzil, the language spoken by the Mayans in the area, the word pox means medicine, cane liquor, and cure. Pox was commonly used in religious ceremonies and festivals in San Juan Chamula, Chiapas, but nowadays soda is often substituted for it."}], "output": "  Sure, here's the answer to your question:\n\nWhat, known as AAS, is commonly used in bodybuilding?\n\nAnswer: Anabolic steroids (AAS) are commonly used in bodybuilding to build muscle and improve athletic performance."},

The library was officially opened in 1944 by Emperor Haile Selassie and began its operations with books donated by the emperor himself. Addis Ababa, also known as Finfinne in Oromo, is the capital and biggest city of Ethiopia. According to the 2007 population census, the city has a population of 3,384,569 people, which is growing at an annual rate of 3.8%. This is actually higher than the previously reported figure of 2,738,248, and it's possible that the actual number of people living in Addis Ababa is even higher.Christianity is the most popular religion in Ghana, with around 71% of the population identifying as Christian. According to the 2010 census, this includes approximately 25% who are Protestant (non-Pentecostal), 13% who are Roman Catholic, 2% who are Protestant (Pentecostal), and 1% who belong to Independent African Churches. In contrast, the 1960 census found that 25% of the population were Muslim, 23% were traditionalists, and 41% were Christians. Unfortunately, the 1970 census did not provide information on the religious composition of the nation.

These plants are known for their thick, fleshy stems and branches that are covered in spines. The name Pachypodium comes from two Latin words: pachus, which means thick, and podion, which means foot or footprint. So, Pachypodium means thick-footed. These plants are part of the dogbane family (Apocynaceae), which is a group of flowering plants that are often found in dry, tropical areas. Stenocereus is a type of cactus that comes from certain parts of Mexico, the United States (Arizona), Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela, and the Dutch Caribbean. The name Stenocereus comes from the Greek words stenos, meaning narrow, and cereus, meaning candle. This genus used to be smaller, but scientists have added species from other genera to it. Stenocereus is closely related to another type of cactus called the peculiar chinoa or chende cactus, which is called Polaskia chende.Coprosma repens is a plant species that belongs to the genus Coprosma and is native to New Zealand. It is commonly known as tree bedstraw, taupata, mirror bush, looking-glass bush, New Zealand laurel, and shiny leaf. This flowering shrub or small tree is a member of the Rubiaceae family and is characterized by its attractive, shiny leaves. Nitrogen assimilation is the process of turning inorganic nitrogen compounds found in the environment into organic nitrogen compounds that can be used by living things. Some organisms, like plants, fungi, and certain bacteria, can't make their own nitrogen, so they need to get it from the environment. These organisms can take in nitrate or ammonia from the environment to use for growth and development. Other organisms, like animals, get all the nitrogen they need from the food they eat, which already has organic nitrogen in it. Parkia timoriana is a type of flowering plant that belongs to the legume family. It's also known as the tree bean in English. In different regions, it's called by different names, such as petai hutan in Borneo, yongchak in Manipur, India, nitta tree and riang in Thailand, kedawung and peundung in Java, alai in Sumatra, petai kerayong and batai hutan in Malaysia, and kupang and amarang in the Philippines. This plant is originally from Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Assam in India. It's grown for food, wood, and ornamental purposes. The poem begins by describing a tree, specifically a Casuarina tree, which has a creeper wrapped around its sturdy trunk. The creeper has left deep marks on the trunk, but the tree remains strong and unharmed. The poet praises the tree's bravery and strength, as few trees could withstand the tight grip of the creeper. The tree is like a giant, with its large size and boldness, and is compared to a colorful scarf with red crimson flowers. At night, the tree echoes with joyful sounds, and a nightingale's song continues until dawn.\n\nThe poet, Toru Dutt, reveals that the tree holds a special place in her heart because she and her siblings spent happy moments under its shade. She believes that nature has a way of sharing emotions with humans and lightening their burdens. The poet describes how strong the image of the tree is, even when she is far away, in lands like France and Italy where she studied. She wishes to immortalize the tree's memory and importance for the sake of those who are no longer alive, and hopes that her love for the tree will protect it from being forgotten.\n\nIn conclusion, the poet expresses her desire to consecrate the tree's memory and importance, much like how Wordsworth sanctified the Yew trees of Borrowdale. She hopes that her love for the Casuarina tree will defend it from the curse of obscurity, ensuring that it remains in people's memories forever. The Davey Tree Expert Company, also known as Davey Tree, is a major player in the green industry, providing tree, utility, lawn care, and environmental consulting services across the United States and Canada. Founded in 1880, it's the first national tree care company and has since grown to become the largest residential tree care company in North America. John Davey, the founder, is regarded as the father of tree surgery and arboriculture. Davey's core services include tree care, utility services, large tree moving, commercial grounds management, and consulting services. What's more, the company has been employee-owned since 1979 and is the largest employee-owned company in Ohio and one of the top 20 in the US. Davey is divided into two segments: Residential and Commercial, and Utility. The Bottle tree (Pachypodium lealii Welw.) is a type of plant that belongs to the Pachypodium genus. This plant was first discovered by a Portuguese geologist named Fernando da Costa Leal during an expedition in southern Angola in the 19th century. The scientific name lealii is named after him as a tribute to his discovery and classification of the plant. A weak heap is a combination of two popular data structure types: the binary heap and the binomial heap. By combining these two structures, a weak heap creates a powerful and efficient priority queue. To store the weak heap in an array, it can be represented as an implicit binary tree, which is similar to the way a binary heap is stored. The best part is that the weak heap still enjoys the same efficiency guarantees as the binary heap. Durvillaea willana is a type of kelp that is similar to Durvillaea antarctica, but is found in more sheltered areas along the coast. While D. willana has smaller blades than D. antarctica, it can still be found growing in lower areas along the shoreline. The reason for this is that D. willana is not as tolerant of wave action as D. antarctica. In New Zealand, D. willana is often confused with bull kelp, but it has a distinct shape that sets it apart. Instead of having honeycombed fronds like D. antarctica, D. willana has thicker, longer stipes with smaller side branches that give it a tree-like appearance. The holdfast of D. willana also grows larger and spreads out like a plate on rocky substrates."}], "output": "  Based on the provided passage, the answer to the question \"Can Stenocereus and Pachypodium both include tree-like plants?\" is:\n\nNo, Stenocereus and Pachypodium are both genera that include cactus and succulent species, respectively, but they do not include tree-like plants. The passage specifically mentions that Pachypodium is a group of plants that are known for their thick, fleshy stems and branches that are covered in spines, which are not typically characteristic of tree-like plants. Stenocereus, on the other hand, is a type of cactus that is native to certain parts of Mexico, the United States, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela, and the Dutch Caribbean, and does not include tree-like plants."},

This collection of musical pieces is considered one of Vivaldi's most notable works and showcases his exceptional skill as a composer. Antonio Vivaldi (March 4, 1678 - July 28, 1741) was a famous Italian composer and violinist. He was born in Venice and is considered one of the greatest Baroque composers of all time. During his lifetime, his music was popular all over Europe. He wrote many instrumental concertos, including ones for the violin and other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than 40 operas. His most famous work is a series of violin concertos called The Four Seasons.Lorenzo Ratti was an Italian composer who lived from around 1589 to 1630. He was a prominent figure in the Baroque period and was known for his work as a composer. Ratti was the predecessor of Carissimi at the Collegium Germanicum, which is a music school. He wrote six Gospel Dialogues, which are musical compositions for the oratory, a type of small performance space. Additionally, Ratti was a teacher of another composer named Benevoli. Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni was an Italian composer who lived from June 8, 1671, to January 17, 1751. He was a prominent figure in his time as an opera composer, but today he is mainly known for his instrumental music, particularly his concertos. Luigi Rossi was an Italian composer who lived in the 17th century. He was born in a small town called Torremaggiore, near the city of Foggia, in the southern part of Italy. When he was young, Luigi went to Naples to study music with a famous composer named Jean de Macque. Macque was the organist at a famous church called the Santa Casa dell'Annunziata and was also the music teacher for the Spanish governor of Naples. After his studies, Luigi went to work for a wealthy family called the Caetani, who were dukes of Traetta. Antonio Lotti was an Italian composer who lived from January 5, 1667, to January 5, 1740. He was a Baroque composer, which means he wrote music during a time period characterized by complex melodies and harmonies. George Frideric Handel (also known as Frederick Handel) was a German-born composer who lived from 1685 to 1759. He spent most of his career in London, where he became famous for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos.

He learned many Italian musical techniques and brought them back to the French court, where he composed around 50 violin sonatas. One of his most famous pieces, an Allegro Spiritoso movement from one of these sonatas, has been transcribed and published for many different instruments, including the cello, bassoon, and euphonium. Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti was an Italian composer born in Naples on October 26, 1685, and died in Madrid on July 23, 1757.

In fact, he was one of the few Baroque composers to transition into the Classical period. Scarlatti's music was diverse, but he is best known today for his 555 keyboard sonatas. Francesco Scarlatti was an Italian composer and musician who lived from 1666 to around 1741. He was the younger brother of Alessandro Scarlatti, who was more famous than him."}], "output": "  The city where the Italian Baroque composer who composed a set of sonatas, titled Op. 5, was born is Venice.**"},

Behind Waimea Bay is Waimea Valley, which means reddish water in Hawaiian. So, Waimea Bay is essentially surrounded by beautiful greenery and a river, and the name Waimea itself has a nice meaning tied to it. Charles M. Van Artsdalen was a famous surfer who was born on January 31, 1941, and passed away on July 18, 1979. He was born in Virginia but moved to La Jolla, California, when he was just 14 years old. Van Artsdalen is most well-known for being one of the first surfers to ride 25-foot waves at popular surf spots like Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach in Hawaii, as well as for inventing the technique of tube riding in the early 1960s and 1970s. He was a member of the prestigious Duke Kahanamoku Surf Team and appeared in several surf movies. Unfortunately, Van Artsdalen passed away due to an illness related to alcohol use.Brylan Van Artsdalen is an American mixed martial artist who was born on August 14, 1984. He is currently fighting in the Featherweight division as a professional. Van Artsdalen has been a professional competitor since 2010 and has previously fought for two well-known MMA organizations, Bellator and CES MMA. Donald West VanArtsdalen (also known as Van Artsdalen) was born on October 21, 1919, and is a senior judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The title of Mister Pipeline is given to skilled surfers who rule the waves at the North Shore's Pipeline. This title was first given to Butch Van Artsdalen, and is passed down through generations by consensus. Other surfers who have held the title include actor Gerry Lopez and bodyboarding legend Mike Stewart. Skimboarding is a sport where a skimboard (similar to a surfboard but smaller and without fins) is used to glide across the water's surface and ride incoming waves back to shore. Skimboarders perform various maneuvers, such as wraps, big spins, 360 shove-its, and 180s, on the wave and in the air. Skimboarding starts on the beach by dropping the board onto the waves' wash, using momentum to skim out to breaking waves, and then catching them to ride back to shore. Another aspect of skimboarding is flatland, which involves performing skateboarding tricks, such as ollies and shove-its, on the waves' wash without catching shore breaks. Skimboarding originated in Southern California when lifeguards wanted to surf the fast and shallow waves that were too big for surfboards. Since then, skimboarding has evolved to ride waves like surfing, perform aerial stunts, and even ride into the barrel of the wave. Professional skimboarders, like Brad Domke, have even developed new techniques, like being towed by jet skis into much larger waves. Tow-in surfing is a technique used by surfers to catch bigger waves than they could paddle to by hand. This technique involves using an outside source, such as a boat or a jet ski, to tow the surfer towards the wave, allowing them to reach faster and bigger waves than they could otherwise. Tow-in surfing was invented by surfers who wanted to ride waves that were over 30 feet high, which was a significant breakthrough in the history of surfing. Waimea Canyon, often called the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, is a big canyon located on the western side of Kauaʻi in the Hawaiian Islands of the United States. It's about 10 miles (16 kilometers) long and up to 3,000 feet (900 meters) deep. The canyon was formed by the Waimea River cutting deep into the ground over time, thanks to the heavy rainfall on the island's central peak, Mount Waiʻaleʻale, which is one of the wettest places on Earth. The name Waimea means red water in Hawaiian, which refers to the red soil that's eroded away by the river and created the canyon's red color. Waimea is a name that's commonly used in both Hawaii and New Zealand. In Hawaiian, the name Waimea means reddish water, while in Maori, it has no meaning. So, Waimea could refer to: Lake surfing is when you surf on a lake with enough surface area for the wind to create waves. Just like ocean surfing, the waves are best when the wind blows from the side, or offshore. But on a lake, the waves generated by the wind don't last as long as they do in the ocean. This means that lake surfers have a shorter time to catch the best waves. Lake surfers are often in the water during a storm, while ocean surfers usually surf on waves created by storms that are far away and take days to reach the shore. High winds can make the waves and water rough, which can make it harder to balance on a surfboard. Because the waves come in faster and more frequently on a lake, lake surfers may have to paddle through waves to catch the next one. Lake surfing also has some advantages, like surfing in fresh water instead of salt water, and not having to worry about dangerous marine life like sharks or jellyfish."}], "output": "  Butch Van Artsdalen was known for surfing 25-foot waves at Waimea Bay in Hawaii. **"},

During World War II, Japan produced a type of rifle called the Type I Arisaka (also known as the I-shiki shōjū) in collaboration with Italy. Initially, the Type I was designed for use by the Imperial Army, but after Japan invaded China, the Navy took over production of the rifle. According to the Anti-Comintern Pact, the Navy contracted with Italy to produce the Type I in 1937. The Type I is similar to the Type 38 rifle, but it uses a different type of magazine. It was primarily used by Japanese naval forces and is chambered for a 6.5 x 50 mm cartridge. In 1938 and 1939, approximately 80,000 Type I rifles were produced, with 40,000 made by Beretta and the remaining 40,000 by Italian government arsenals. The final shipment of Type I rifles was sent to Japan by submarine in 1941.

The QBB-95 and other weapons in the Type 95 family share many parts and ammunition, but some units are issued with different models, such as the Type 56, Type 81, or Type 03 Assault rifle. These weapons all use the same 5.8×42mm DBP87 round. The QBB-95 has a longer, heavier barrel and a 80-round drum magazine, which allows it to fire continuously for longer periods of time. However, it can also use a standard 30-round box magazine if needed. Eugene Cross Park is a sports field in Ebbw Vale, Wales, where rugby and cricket games are played. In 1919, a group called the Ebbw Vale Welfare Association bought a 6-acre piece of land called the Welfare Ground. They renamed it in honor of a man named Sir Eugene Cross, who was a very important and long-serving member of the group. The ground has terraces, a stand that was rebuilt after a fire destroyed the old one, and a clubhouse with a pub, a club shop, and award-winning hospitality options. The stadium is located near the B4486 road, the Newchurch Road, and the Ebbw River. Edward Eugene Goober Cox was a U.S. Representative from Georgia for almost 28 years. He was a conservative Democrat who supported segregation and opposed President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. As a senior member of the House Committee on Rules, Cox chaired two special investigative committees that were criticized for being biased and targeting people he didn't like. In 1941, with the United States on the brink of entering World War II, Cox proposed creating another investigative committee similar to the one that was formed during the Civil War. However, Roosevelt beat him to it by proposing a similar committee led by Missouri Senator Harry S. Truman. The Truman Committee ended up being a crucial asset to the war effort, and its chairman, Truman, went on to become Roosevelt's Vice President and then President after Roosevelt's death in 1945. The Type 4 Rifle, also known as the Type 5 Rifle (Japanese: 四式自動小銃), was a Japanese experimental semi-automatic rifle. It was similar to the American M1 Garand but had some key differences. Instead of using an en-bloc clip like the Garand, the Type 4 had an integral 10-round magazine and was chambered for the Japanese 7.7×58mm Arisaka cartridge. The rifle also had Japanese-style tangent sights. Although the Type 4 was developed alongside other experimental semi-automatic rifles, only 250 were made before the end of World War II, and many were never assembled due to problems with jamming and feed systems.

The Academy Award for Best Film Editing is one of the annual awards given by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS). The editing award is closely related to the Academy Award for Best Picture, with many of the same films being nominated for both awards. In fact, for 33 years (from 1981 to 2013), every film that won the Best Picture award was also nominated for the Film Editing Oscar. Only the main editor(s) listed in the film's credits are eligible to receive the award, and they are chosen through a secret ballot of the Editing Branch of the Academy. The voting members of the branch can vote for up to five of the eligible films in order of their preference, and the five films with the most votes are selected as nominees. Finally, the Academy Award itself is chosen by a vote of all active and life members of the Academy. This process is different from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), where the nominees are chosen through a general ballot of Academy voters, and the winner is selected by members of the editing chapter. 127 Hours is a movie released in 2010 that tells the true story of Aron Ralston, a canyoneer who got trapped by a boulder in a remote canyon in Utah.

On October 31, 1999, all 217 people on board EgyptAir Flight 990 died when the plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Massachusetts. An investigation by the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found that the pilot, who was acting as relief first officer in command at the time of the crash, made a series of unusual control inputs that led to the crash. EgyptAir Flight 990 (also referred to as MS990 or MSR990) was a regular flight that traveled from Los Angeles International Airport in the United States to Cairo International Airport in Egypt with a stop in New York City at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Tragically, on October 31, 1999, the Boeing 767 aircraft operating this route crashed into the Atlantic Ocean about 60 miles south of Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, resulting in the deaths of all 217 people on board. According to the official investigation, the probable cause of the crash was the deliberate actions of the relief first officer.  On May 27, 2017, a small plane called Summit Air flight 409 crashed while trying to land at an airport in Nepal called Tenzing-Hillary Airport. The plane, a Let L-410, was on its final approach to Landing Runway 06 when it hit trees short of the runway and crashed onto the ground. The plane slid down a slope before coming to a stop about 200 meters below the runway. Sadly, the captain and first officer died in the crash, while another crew member was injured. At the time of the accident, visibility was poor due to fog. The runway 06 at Tenzing-Hillary Airport is an all visual runway, which means that pilots must rely on their own eyes to guide the plane during landing, rather than using instruments. FedEx Express Flight 80 was a cargo flight that departed from Guangzhou, China and was headed to Narita, Japan. On March 23, 2009, the flight, which was operated by a McDonnell Douglas MD-11F aircraft (N526FE), encountered problems during landing and crashed at 6:48 am local time (21:48 UTC on March 22). The aircraft, carrying only the two pilots, became unstable during the landing and bounced, resulting in structural damage to the landing gear and airframe. The plane then crashed and caught fire, killing both the captain and first officer.

Homer Jr. Foundation is a non-profit organization established in memory of LeRoy Homer, a first officer on United Airlines Flight 93 that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001. LeRoy and another pilot, Tom Dahl, were believed to have taken actions to resist the hijackers, including disabling the autopilot and switching the pilots' microphones to the radio transmitter. After learning of the earlier crashes at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the crew and passengers attempted to regain control of the plane. However, the hijackers were unable to disengage the autopilot, and the plane crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township, Pennsylvania, killing everyone on board. Before the plane went down, it was believed that LeRoy had regained consciousness and was part of the final attempt to force the plane to crash somewhere else, possibly in Washington, D.C.

The third officer served as a relief pilot and aircrew member, and could switch between the roles of pilot, co-pilot, radio officer, and flight engineer to give the primary crew a break. However, in modern aviation, relief pilots are usually given junior ranks such as first officer or second officer instead of the specific title of third officer.

There's a Goat on the Roof or Poleconomy \n\n Passage: Hey there! Did you know that there was a fun children's board game called 'Hey Pa! There's a Goat on the Roof' released by Parker Brothers in 1966? It was a great game for kids to play together! Poleconomy is a board game invented by New Zealander Bruce E. Hatherley and first published in 1980. It's similar to Monopoly, but instead of buying properties, players compete to acquire companies and investments through economic and political activities. The game can last for a set amount of time agreed upon by all players, usually around 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the total value of all players' cash, companies, insurance, and other assets. Another goal of the game is to teach players about basic economics and how the economy and government interact. Different editions of the game were created for different countries. The name Poleconomy is a portmanteau of politics and economy.Pashmina is a luxurious type of wool that originated in Kashmir, India. The name Pashmina comes from the Persian language and means soft gold. These shawls are made from the fine fibers of the Cashmere goat, which is found in four distinct breeds: the Changthangi or Kashmir Pashmina goat from the Changthang plateau in Kashmir, the Malra from Kargil area in Kashmir, the Chegu from Himachal Pradesh in northern India and Pakistan, and the Chyangara or Nepalese Pashmina goat from Nepal. The shawls are hand-spun and woven in Kashmir and Nepal, creating a soft and lightweight fabric that is highly valued for its warmth and beauty. Santana's Verão Vermelho is a song from the album Festival that features Brazilian singer Elis Regina. The song has a catchy melody with meaningless lyrics sung by The Waters Family backing vocalists (Badadup, badadup, badadup, ba pa pa ba pa pa). The song has a strong rhythm with a marching drum beat and maracas, and Santana plays a unique flamenco guitar solo during the intro and outro of the song. This is the first time Santana has played a flamenco guitar solo in one of his songs. The flamenco guitar solo in the coda is also accompanied by a keyboard flourish by Tom Coster, adding to the overall rhythm and energy of the song. The Ford flathead V8 engine, also known as the Ford V8 or flatty, was designed and built by Ford Motor Company and its licensees from 1932 to 1953. During its first decade of production, the engine was simply called the Ford V8, and its first car model, the Model 18, was referred to as the Ford V8 as well. The engine was a market first in that it made an 8-cylinder engine affordable and a V-type engine affordable to the mass market consumer for the first time. It was Ford's first independently designed and built V8 engine produced for mass production, and it was a groundbreaking development for the company.\n\nThe engine was in tune with the cultural trend of the time, which was a fascination with ever-more-powerful engines. It became a phenomenal success and was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks for 21 years, making it the engine with the longest production run for the U.S. consumer market. The Ford flathead V8 engine was even named one of the 10 best engines of the 20th century by Ward's and remains famous in the classic car hobby today, despite the many other popular V8 engines that followed. Friendship Hall is a historic home located in East New Market, Dorchester County, Maryland. It's a beautiful Georgian-style brick house built around 1790. The main part of the house has five bays (rooms) and two stories, while the passageway has two bays and one story. There's also a one-story kitchen wing. On the property, you'll find a tall frame smokehouse with a sloping roof and wooden boards. This house has a special connection to the Sulivane family, who first arrived in Maryland in 1695 and have been an important part of the area's history ever since. Veti-gel is a special kind of medicine for animals that can help stop bleeding quickly. It's called Veti-gel because the name is similar to the name of a product in a popular video game called Mass Effect. Veti-gel is made from a combination of natural materials that work together to form a mesh that seals the wound and stops the bleeding. The company that makes Veti-gel, Suneris Inc, is a biotech company based in the United States. They are planning to release Veti-gel for use in the military and emergency medical field first, and then for use in human surgery once the product has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The Rove is a breed of goat that was first domesticated in France. Until recently, the breed was in danger of disappearing, with only a few hundred Roves left on French farms. However, thanks to conservation efforts, there are now over 5000 registered Roves on French farms. Initially, the breed was raised for meat, but due to a decline in the French market for goat meat, farmers have started to use Roves for dairy production instead. Chatta Bazaar, located in Hyderabad, India, is a historic market that has been around for a long time. In fact, it was the first market in Hyderabad to introduce the concept of under-roof shopping, which provided better protection and storage for goods. This innovation made shopping more convenient and comfortable for customers, and Chatta Bazaar has remained a popular destination for shoppers ever since. VELUX is a Danish company that makes roof windows and skylights. The company was started by a man named Villum Kann Rasmussen over 75 years ago, when he installed the first VELUX roof window in a Danish school. Since then, the company has been growing and expanding into new markets. In 1952, VELUX partnered with a German businessman named Ernst Günter Albers to enter the German market. Later, the company was passed down to Lars Kann-Rasmussen and Peter Albers, the sons of the original founder and his partner."}], "output": "  Of course!

The Rams had a great season, finishing with a record of 13-3 in the regular season and winning the NFC West championship. The Tennessee Titans played in their 41st season in 2000, which was also their 31st in the National Football League (NFL). This was the team's second year under the name Titans, after previously being known as the Houston Oilers. Since they had lost the Super Bowl the previous year to the St. Louis Rams, they entered the season as the defending AFC champions.Thomas E. Ted Plumb was born on August 20, 1939, and had a successful career as both a football player and coach in the United States. After playing for the Buffalo Bills in training camp, his playing career was cut short due to a neck injury. However, this setback led to a long and exciting coaching career that spanned multiple levels of football, including high school, college, and the NFL. Plumb was a coach for two of the most legendary Super Bowl champions in NFL history: the 1985 Chicago Bears and the 2000 St. Louis Rams. He served as the Wide Receivers Coach for the Chicago Bears and as the Director of Pro Scouting for the St. Louis Rams. After retiring in 2000, Plumb returned to his home in Alba, Texas. Super Bowl XXXVII was a big football game played in 2002 between the Oakland Raiders and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

It's named after George Wythe, a famous American statesman and the Declaration of Independence signer, who also mentored Thomas Jefferson. According to the 2010 census, the town's population was 8,211. Wytheville is situated at the intersection of two major highways, Interstate 77 and Interstate 81, making it a significant transportation hub. During the American Civil War, the town played a strategic role and was attacked twice, in 1863 (Toland's Raid) and 1865 (Stoneman's Raid). Additionally, Wytheville is the birthplace of Edith Bolling Wilson, the wife of President Woodrow Wilson. Interstate 81 (I-81) is a 855-mile highway that runs through several states in the United States. Of all the states, Virginia has the longest portion of I-81, which covers 324.92 miles. In fact, the section of I-81 in Virginia is longer than any other state's section of the highway. The route starts near the Tennessee state line, near the city of Bristol, and ends near the West Virginia state line, near the city of Winchester.Interstate 40 (I-40) is a major highway that runs from California to North Carolina, passing through the states of Tennessee and North Carolina. In North Carolina, I-40 enters the state near the Pigeon River Gorge from Tennessee and runs across the entire state, connecting several cities including Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Durham, and Raleigh. The highway passes through different landscapes, such as the Blue Ridge Mountains, foothills, suburban areas, urban centers, and farmland. With a total length of 423.55 miles, I-40 is the longest interstate highway in North Carolina. There are also five auxiliary Interstates and one business loop in the state that are related to I-40. Interestingly, while the route is labeled as east-west for its entire length, the eastern portion of I-40 (from Hillsboro to Wilmington) follows a more north-south alignment. In New York, there are 32 Interstate Highways, including 9 main routes and 23 auxiliary routes. These highways are maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), but with some exceptions. Unlike in other states, Interstate Highways in New York don't have their numbers directly referenced on signs or in internal documents. Instead, the letter I is added to the number of the route, so you might see I-86 instead of IH-86 on signs. This can sometimes lead to confusion, as there may be duplicate numbers for Interstate Highways and state routes, such as I-86 and NY-86. However, the I suffix helps to distinguish between the two, so you'll see 86I on signs for the Interstate Highway and 86 for the state route. In Illinois, the Interstate Highways are part of the larger Interstate Highway System, which is owned and maintained by the U.S. government. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is responsible for taking care of these highways in the state. The Interstate Highway System in Illinois includes 13 main highways and 11 auxiliary highways that cover a total distance of 2,248.93 miles. The longest Interstate Highway in Illinois is Interstate 57, which spans 358.57 miles, while the shortest is Interstate 41, which is only 0.90 miles long. Maryland has 16 Interstate Highways that either fully or partially pass through the state. Of these, six are primary Interstates and ten are auxiliary Interstates that connect to one of the primary Interstates. The longest primary Interstate in Maryland is Interstate 95 (I-95), which spans 110.01 miles. The shortest primary Interstate in Maryland is Interstate 81 (I-81), which is 12.08 miles long. Interstate 97 (I-97) is the shortest primary Interstate in Maryland, stretching for 17.62 miles and located entirely within one county without connecting to any other primary Interstate.\n\nThe longest auxiliary Interstate in Maryland is Interstate 695 (I-695), which measures 51.48 miles long. The shortest auxiliary Interstate in Maryland is Interstate 295 (I-295), which is only 0.80 miles long. All Interstates in Maryland are maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration, except for a small portion of Interstate 395, Interstate 895, and Interstate 95 within and north of Baltimore, and Interstate 83 within Baltimore. Maryland also has one unsigned Interstate, Interstate 595, which is marked as U.S. Route 50 and US 301 for its entire length. Finally, there is one former Interstate in Maryland, Interstate 170, which is shaded in dark gray in the list.   In 1962, the Utah State Legislature made some changes to the Utah State Route system in conjunction with the designation of several routes in the Interstate Highway System through the state. These changes were mostly invisible to the public and only affected the unsigned legislative designations. The main effect of the changes was to assign route numbers 1 through 5 to future corridors of the Interstate Highways in Utah. Additionally, some unsigned highways serving state parks and institutions were changed. Some routes were also shortened or reassigned to allow for a single route number to be assigned to the Interstate Highway corridors. Since little of the Interstate Highway System had been constructed in Utah by 1962, these changes were primarily made to support future construction. Some of the changes made in 1962 were not signed until years later, and only a few of the changes made that year are still valid today. As construction of the Interstate Highway system progressed, the legislature made additional changes to the route designations in 1977, eliminating some of the unsigned legislative and concurrences in the process. The auxiliary Interstate Highways, also known as three-digit Interstate Highways, are a secondary network of highways within the Interstate Highway System in the United States. While they follow the same standards as the mainline Interstate Highways, they are a distinct subset of the system. Despite their secondary status, these highways still meet all federal standards, including receiving 90% of their funding from the federal government. In other words, they are similar to the mainline Interstate Highways in many ways, but with some key differences. In Texas, the Interstate Highways are owned and maintained by the state government. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and operations of the Interstate Highways. The Interstate Highway System in Texas spans 3,239.7 miles and includes 12 primary routes, 7 auxiliary routes, and Interstate 35 (I-35), which is divided into two branches (I-35E and I-35W) that provide access to Fort Worth and Dallas. The longest segment of Interstate Highway in Texas is Interstate 10, which measures 878.6 miles, while the shortest is Interstate 110, which is just 0.9 miles long. Interstate 85 (I-85) is a major highway that runs from Alabama to Virginia, passing through the eastern part of Southside Virginia. In Virginia, I-85 is 68.64 miles long and runs parallel to US Route 1 (US 1) from Petersburg to south of South Hill. The highway intersects with US 58, a major east-west highway in Southside Virginia. I-85 is the primary connection between the Richmond-Petersburg metropolitan area and major metropolitan areas in North Carolina, such as the Research Triangle. Like all mainline Interstate Highways, I-85 is a part of Virginia's National Highway System for its entire length."}], "output": "  The population of the town at the intersection of Interstate Highways 77 and the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia is 8,211."},

He was the son of former Philadelphia mob boss Philip Testa and served as a hitman for the Philadelphia crime family during a time of internal gang conflict. Testa was known as a rising star in the mob until he was tragically killed on orders from Nicky Scarfo Sr. The Philadelphia crime family, also known as the Philadelphia Mafia, the Philly Mob/Mafia, the Bruno-Scarfo family, the South Philly Mob/Mafia, or the Philadelphia-South Jersey Mob/Mafia, is a criminal organization based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This organization is made up of Italian Americans and operates in various areas and neighborhoods throughout the Philadelphia metropolitan area and Delaware Valley, including Southeastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, particularly South Jersey. The Philadelphia family is known for its violence and has been involved in multiple mob wars due to the succession of violent bosses.The Los Angeles crime family is an Italian-American criminal organization based in California, which is part of the larger American Mafia (or Cosa Nostra). The family was started in the early 20th century and has since grown throughout Southern California. Like other Mafia families in the US, the L.A. crime family made money during the Prohibition Era by bootlegging alcohol. At its peak in the 1940s and early 1950s, the family was led by Jack Dragna, who was a member of a powerful group called The Commission. However, the L.A. family has been in decline since Dragna's death, and today the Chicago Outfit represents them on The Commission. Joseph Baldie LoPiccolo was an American criminal who was a member of the New York Gambino crime family and worked under Santo Trafficante, Jr.'s criminal organization. His main area of expertise was trafficking in drugs. The Italian American One Voice Coalition is a national organization that works to protect Italian American heritage and combat all forms of discrimination. They do this by providing information, education, and advocacy to defend Italian American culture and combat negative stereotypes. The organization aims to present a united front in the face of defamation and discrimination, and is the only organization of its kind in the country. Operation Power Outage was a law enforcement sting operation aimed at arresting and charging members of the Armenian American criminal group Armenian Power (also known as AP-13). Accused of committing a range of crimes, including racketeering, bank fraud, kidnapping, and drug trafficking, Armenian Power has been active for over 20 years and has grown from a local street gang into a sophisticated international criminal organization with over 200 members. The Sopranos is a popular American TV show created by David Chase. The show follows the life of Tony Soprano, a fictional character from New Jersey who is part of the Italian-American mafia. Tony tries to balance his criminal activities with his personal life, which includes therapy sessions with psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi. The show features a cast of characters, including Tony's family members, mafia colleagues, and rivals, such as his wife Carmela and protege Christopher Moltisanti. The Mexican Mafia, also known as La eMe, is a criminal organization of Mexican American prisoners in the United States. Although the name suggests otherwise, the Mexican Mafia did not originate in Mexico and is not directly affiliated with any Mexican gangs. Instead, it is a group of criminals who have formed a hierarchical structure within the U.S. prison system. Some gangs, such as MS-13 and Florencia 13, use the number 13 to show their loyalty to the Mexican Mafia. Law enforcement agencies believe that La eMe is the most powerful gang within the California prison system, with around 155-300 official members and hundreds of associates who help carry out illegal activities in the hopes of becoming full members. The National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame is a nonprofit organization that recognizes exceptional athletes of Italian descent in the United States. In 1977, George Randazzo founded the Italian American Boxing Hall of Fame as a way to raise money for local Catholic youth programs. The success of this initiative led to the creation of the National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame in 1978, which honored 23 former Italian American boxing champions during its first induction ceremony. Since then, over 230 Italian Americans have been inducted into the hall of fame, including notable athletes like Lou Ambers, Eddie Arcaro, Charley Trippi, Gino Marchetti, Dom DiMaggio, Joe DiMaggio, and Vince Lombardi. The Barrow Gang was a notorious American criminal group active from 1932 to 1934. They were infamous outlaws, robbers, and criminals who traveled across the Central United States during the Great Depression. Their illegal activities were widely reported in the American press and captured the attention of the public, earning them the nickname public enemies. While they were known for robbing banks, they actually preferred to target smaller stores and gas stations.

He designed the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris, which spans the Seine River, and served as the supervisor of royal works under two French kings, Henri III and Henri IV. Some of his other notable works include several luxurious houses, known as hôtels particuliers, which were built during this time. These houses include the Hôtel d'Angoulême, the Hôtel de Lamoignon (which now houses the Historical Library of the City of Paris), and the Hôtel de Mayenne (located in the Marais neighborhood). The Hôtel de Mayenne is particularly notable for its unique design, featuring rhythmically varied dormer windows set against a high slate roof, with the pediments of its piano nobile windows placed on top of the frieze above. Henry III was born on September 19, 1551, and was also known as Alexandre Édouard de France and Henryk Walezy in Polish and Lithuanian. He became the King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1573 and then became the King of France in 1574 until his death in 1589. Henry III was the last king of the French royal family known as the House of Valois.Jean Androuet du Cerceau was a French architect who lived from around 1585 to 1650. He was the son of another famous architect named Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau, who was considered the best architect of his generation in Paris. Salomon de Brosse was a prominent French architect in the early 17th century, who had a significant influence on François Mansart. Salomon was born in Verneuil-en-Halatte, Oise, into a well-known Huguenot family. His mother was the granddaughter of Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau, a famous designer, and his father was an architect named Jean de Brosse. Salomon started his career in Paris in 1598 and was appointed as the court architect in 1608. Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, who was born in 1550, was a famous French architect. He lived until September 16, 1614. In 1573, the Warsaw Confederation was signed by the Polish national assembly (known as the Sejm Konwokacyjny) in Warsaw. This historic document was the first in Europe to grant religious freedom to people. It was a significant event in the history of Poland and Lithuania, as it gave religious tolerance to both nobles and free individuals living within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. As a result, the Commonwealth became a much more tolerant and safe place compared to most of Europe at the time, especially during the subsequent Thirty Years' War. While it didn't completely eliminate all religious conflicts, it was an important step towards greater religious freedom. Androuet du Cerceau was a well-known family of French architects and designers who were active in the 16th and early 17th centuries. This family produced several talented architects and designers who made significant contributions to the field during their time.   Jean Baptiste Assenede (also known as Jan Baptist Assenede, Jean Baptiste Assenie, and Jean Baptiste Asseny) was a Flemish painter from the Baroque period who lived in Italy in the middle of the 17th century. He was born in Tournai during the first half of the 17th century. We know that he was active in Rome from 1646 to 1655, where he became a member of the Bentvueghels, a group of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists living in Rome. His nickname, 'Lantaren', is Dutch for 'Lantern'. Unfortunately, no paintings by Assenede are known to exist today. Paul Androuet du Cerceau (1623-1710) was a skilled French goldsmith and engraver who lived in Paris around 1610. According to Benezit, Reynaud believes that Paul is the son of Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau, the architect who constructed the iconic Pont Neuf bridge in Paris. However, recent research suggests that Paul may actually be the grandson of Jacques II Androuet du Cerceau, the original architect of the Pont Neuf. Jacques I Androuet du Cerceau (1510-1584) was a talented French designer during the 16th century who made significant contributions to the fields of architecture, ornamentation, furniture, metalwork, and other decorative designs. He is considered the founder of the Androuet du Cerceau family and played a crucial role in introducing Renaissance architecture to France. Du Cerceau worked closely with influential designers like Pierre Lescot, Philibert Delorme, and Jean Bullant, and was even referred to as the architect of the king. However, he is perhaps best known for his beautiful suites of engravings, which he produced from his printshop in Orléans starting in 1549. These engravings include a series of triumphal arches and are considered some of his most notable works."}], "output": "  According to the passage, Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau was the supervisor of royal works under King Henry III of France.

He served as a top commander in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, teaching the soldiers important military skills like drills, tactics, and discipline. He wrote a book called Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States, which was the standard drill manual for the US military until the Civil War. Steuben also served as Chief of Staff for General George Washington in the final years of the war. The SS General von Steuben was a German passenger liner and later an armed transport ship in the Nazi German navy, also known as the Kriegsmarine. Initially launched as the München (or Muenchen) in 1929, it was renamed General von Steuben in 1930 after a famous German officer from the American Revolutionary War. Finally, it was renamed again as Steuben in 1938. During World War II, the ship was sunk.HMS Swan was the first ship in a class of 25 ships called the Swan class, which were built in the 1760s and 1770s. She was launched on November 21, 1767, and was known as HMS Explosion between 1779 and 1783. During her time in service, she participated in both the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary War. After serving for many years, she was laid up in 1801 and eventually sold for disposal in 1814. Vice-Admiral Robert Plampin (1762-1834) was a British Navy officer who served during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. He is best known for his time as commander of the British colony of Saint Helena, where he oversaw the imprisonment of former French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. Plampin was born into a Navy family and began his sea career at the age of 13, fighting in the American Revolutionary War. During the French Revolutionary Wars, he served in several ships and had mixed success, including being involved in a shipwreck and serving ashore during sieges. After the Peace of Amiens, Plampin took command of the ship of the line HMS Powerful and operated successfully in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. In 1816, following Napoleon's defeat and capture, Plampin was placed in command of the squadron at the Cape of Good Hope, which included Saint Helena, where he regularly visited and spoke with Napoleon. HMS Vulture was a small naval ship, called a sloop, that was launched for the British Navy on March 18, 1776. She served in two wars: the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary War.

The HMT Empire Windrush was a passenger liner and cruise ship that was built in Germany in 1930. At the time, it was called the MV Monte Rosa. During the 1930s, it operated as a cruise ship under its original name. When World War II started, the German navy took over the ship and used it as a troopship. After the war, the United Kingdom took possession of the ship as a prize of war and renamed it the Empire Windrush. The ship continued to be used as a troopship until it caught fire and sank in the Mediterranean Sea in March 1954, resulting in the loss of four crew members. Tobago was a ship launched in 1790. In 1793, she was taken over by the British during the French Revolutionary Wars. She continued to trade with Tobago for several years before being sold to new owners who used her for whaling. Tobago made two voyages to the East Coast of Africa for whaling before being sold again to new owners.

Bjørnøya (which means Bear Island in English) is an inhabited island located in Haram Municipality in the county of Møre og Romsdal, Norway. It's connected to the mainland by a man-made causeway. The closest major village on the mainland is Søvik. To the east of Bjørnøya, there's a smaller island called Terøya, which is separated from Bjørnøya by the Bjørnøysundet strait. Bjørnøya used to be part of the municipality of Borgund, but it joined Haram in 1965. Loppa Church (Norwegian: Loppa kirke) is a small white wooden church located in the village of Loppa on the sparsely populated island of Loppa in Finnmark county, Norway. It belongs to the Loppa parish in the Alta deanery of the Diocese of Nord-Hålogaland. The church was built in 1953 and can seat around 150 people. However, due to the island's limited population, the church is not often used. The island of Vilsandi, located in Kihelkonna Parish, Saare County, Estonia, is situated in the Baltic Sea. It covers an area of around 9 square kilometers and is the westernmost inhabited island in Estonia. The surrounding waters are shallow and rocky, and many ships have sunk in these waters over the years. To reach the island, you can take a boat, drive a vehicle with suitable clearance, or walk to it from the nearby island of Saaremaa. Vilsandi National Park, which was established as a bird reserve in 1910, now covers much of the island. This park is an important habitat for many migratory bird species, making it a sensitive ecosystem. Hunting is strictly prohibited within the park to protect the birds. Vilsandi National Park is a popular tourist destination not only for people from Estonia but also for those visiting from nearby Finland, who are coming in greater numbers.

Under this treaty, Afghanistan's leader, Mohammad Yaqub Khan, gave up control of some areas near the border to Britain, while still maintaining full control over the rest of the country. The Second Anglo-Afghan War took place from 1878 to 1880 between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan. This was the second time the British invaded Afghanistan. The war ended with the British emerging victorious against the Afghan rebels, and the Afghans agreed to let the British achieve their political goals as outlined in the Treaty of Gandamak. As a result, most British and Indian soldiers left Afghanistan, but the Afghan tribes were allowed to maintain their internal rule and cultural practices. However, the British also gained control of Afghanistan's foreign relations, ensuring the country's independence from foreign military powers and serving as a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire.The Emirate of Afghanistan (which is today's Islamic Republic of Afghanistan) was a region that existed between Central Asia and South Asia. This emirate began when Dost Mohammed Khan, the leader of the Barakzai dynasty in Kabul, became powerful. The history of the Emirate was affected by the Great Game between Russia and the United Kingdom, who were trying to gain power in Central Asia. This period saw European colonial powers expanding their interests in South Asia. The Emirate fought wars with the Sikh Empire, and in 1842, British-led Indian forces invaded Afghanistan and completely defeated the Afghans. However, the British were defeated in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, and the British regained control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed. The Suzhou Rail Transit Line 2 is the main north-south line that runs through the city. The first phase of the line is 26.557 kilometers long, with 6.57 kilometers elevated, 19.146 kilometers underground, and 0.67 kilometers open wide. The line starts at Suzhou North Railway Station and ends at Baodaiqiao South Station near Baodai Bridge. The line passes through five districts of Suzhou and has 22 stations, including 17 underground and 5 overhead. The first phase of the line began operating on December 28, 2013. In 1563, Catherine de' Medici, the regent for her son Charles IX of France, signed the Edict of Amboise, also known as the Edict of Pacification. This treaty officially ended the first phase of the French Wars of Religion and brought peace to France by giving the Huguenots (French Protestants) certain religious privileges and freedoms. After the 2003 World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) in Geneva failed to reach an agreement on the future of internet governance, the United Nations established a multistakeholder Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG) to continue the dialogue. The WSIS first phase agreed to continue the discussion on internet governance in its Declaration of Principles and Action Plan adopted on December 12, 2003, with the goal of reaching a decision at the second phase of the WSIS in Tunis in November 2005. As part of this effort, the WSIS requested the United Nations Secretary-General to establish the WGIG. In 2010, heat waves affected many parts of the world, including the United States, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, China, Hong Kong, North Africa, and Europe. These heat waves occurred in May, June, July, and August of that year. The heat waves were caused by two phases of weather events: a moderate El Niño event that lasted from June 2009 to May 2010, and a very strong La Niña event that lasted from June 2010 to June 2011. The El Niño event caused moderate temperatures in the affected areas, but it also set new record high temperatures. The La Niña event was much more severe and caused devastating heat waves and multiple record-breaking temperatures. The heat waves began in April 2010 and lasted until October 2010, affecting many regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Shagai Plateau, also known as Shagai Heights, is a flat area near the Khyber Pass. There was a fort called Fort Al Creator nearby. To reach the Shagai Plateau, you start your journey from the southeast entrance of the Khyber Pass in what is now Pakistan. During the Second Anglo-Afghan War, which began in November 1878, the British set up a camp near the Shagai Plateau because they were worried about Russia's growing influence in Afghanistan. The war had two phases. The first phase ended in May 1879 with a treaty called the Treaty of Gandamak, which gave Afghanistan some independence but made them follow British foreign policy. The fighting restarted in September 1879 after an uprising in Kabul, and the war finally ended in September 1880 with the Battle of Kandahar. The Afghan Civil War lasted from 1996 to 2001 and was part of the ongoing War in Afghanistan, which began in 1978. In 1996, the Taliban captured the capital city of Kabul and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan, but the Islamic State of Afghanistan remained the internationally recognized government of Afghanistan. Only Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban's Emirate. In response, the defense minister of the Islamic State of Afghanistan, Ahmad Shah Massoud, formed the United Front (also known as the Northern Alliance) to oppose the Taliban. This coalition included representatives from various Afghan ethnic groups, such as Tajiks, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Turkmens, and some Pashtuns. During the conflict, the Taliban received military support from Pakistan and financial support from Saudi Arabia. Pakistan sent its military forces to fight against the United Front, while Al Qaeda provided the Taliban with thousands of fighters from various countries. <ref name=Ahmed Rashid/The Telegraph></ref> In 1920, there was a military conflict between the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) and the Young Bukharians against the Emirate of Bukhara.

Within a few hours, the number of people killed reached seven. The suspect, 43-year-old One L. Goh, a former student at the school, was taken into custody. This shooting was one of the deadliest university shootings in US history, ranking fourth after the Virginia Tech massacre, the University of Texas Clock Tower shooting, and the Umpqua Community College shooting, and eighth overall. It was also the deadliest mass killing in Oakland's history. On October 1, 2015, a tragic event occurred at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, USA. A 26-year-old man named Chris Harper-Mercer, who was a student at the school, shot and killed an assistant professor and eight students in a classroom. Seven to nine other people were injured in the attack. The local police responded quickly and engaged Harper-Mercer in a brief shooting. However, he was injured and later died by shooting himself in the head. This mass shooting was the deadliest in Oregon's recent history.In May 1945, after World War II ended in Yugoslavia, a mass killing of prisoners of war (POWs) took place in Tezno, near Maribor. The killings were carried out by units of the Yugoslav Partisans and resulted in the deaths of many POWs from the Independent State of Croatia (NDH). The executions began on May 19th when prisoners were brought to the Tezno forest from nearby prison camps and continued until May 26th. The bodies were buried in a long, several kilometers long antitank trench that the Yugoslav authorities kept secret.

The Athletics and Tigers battled it out for the chance to advance to the World Series, with the Athletics eventually emerging victorious in the best-of-seven series, 3-2. The first two games were held at the Oakland Coliseum, and the next three games were played at Tiger Stadium in Detroit.   In 2007, a tragic event occurred in Mosul, Iraq, known as the Mosul massacre. On April 23rd of that year, a bus carrying workers from the Mosul Textile Factory was hijacked by unidentified attackers. The attackers checked the passengers' identity cards and separated the Muslims and Christians from the rest of the passengers. They then took the bus to an unknown location in eastern Mosul, where the remaining 23 Yazidi passengers were made to lie down face-first before being shot. This horrific event resulted in the murder of innocent people and left a lasting impact on the community.

According to the British Hit Singles & Albums book, Slade is the most successful British group of the 1970s based on single sales. This is impressive because Slade was the first act to have three songs enter the charts at number one, and all six of their chart-toppers were written by the band's lead vocalist, Noddy Holder, and bassist, Jim Lea. As of 2006, the band's total UK sales stand at 6,520,171, with their best-selling single, Merry Xmas Everybody, selling over one million copies.The second studio album by the English post-punk band Siouxsie and the Banshees, titled Join Hands, was released in September 1979.

He is best known for his work with the bands Rage Against the Machine, Audioslave, Street Sweeper Social Club, and his folk alter ego The Nightwatchman. Morello started playing guitar in the mid-1980s with his friend and future Tool guitarist Adam Jones. After graduating from Harvard University in 1986 with a degree in political science, Morello moved to Los Angeles, where he worked as an aide to Senator Alan Cranston. Morello then introduced Jones and Maynard James Keenan to Danny Carey, which led to the formation of the band Tool. In the late 1980s, Morello replaced the original guitar player in the rock band Lock Up and released an album with them in 1986. He then left Lock Up to start a new band, which he formed with Zack de la Rocha, whom he was impressed by his freestyle rapping. Morello also drafted Brad Wilk, who had previously auditioned as a drummer for Lock Up. With Zack's childhood friend Tim Commerford joining as the band's bass player, the lineup was complete. In 2007, the indie rock band Dirty Projectors released their album Rise Above, which was led by band leader Dave Longstreth. Interestingly, Longstreth had not heard the Black Flag album Damaged in 15 years before creating Rise Above, so it was his reinterpretation of that classic album. The album features Longstreth on guitar and vocals, Amber Coffman on vocals and guitar, Brian McOmber on drums, Nat Baldwin on bass, and Susanna Waiche on vocals. Angel Deradoorian joined the band on bass and vocals just before the Rise Above tour, making this album the first to showcase Dirty Projectors as a fully formed band rather than just Longstreth's solo project.

They released their self-titled debut album in 1980 on Cole's own label, Whizeagle. After Rod Rat left the band, he played drums for another Portland band called Domino Theory before passing away by suicide. The band then had different drummers for their next two albums, including Sam Henry of the Wipers and Louis Samora. The band broke up in the mid-1980s, but reunited for a single in 1984. Fred later formed a country band called Western Front, and he and Toody went on to form the band Dead Moon.

Over time, the town grew and developed alongside the industry, becoming a major production center for cotton textiles during the Industrial Revolution. In its heyday in 1929, Bolton was home to 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works, making it one of the world's largest and most productive centers of cotton spinning. However, the British cotton industry declined significantly after World War I, and by the 1980s, cotton manufacturing had almost come to a standstill in Bolton. Rivington Hall Barn is located near Chorley and Bolton in Lancashire, England. The barn is believed to have been built between the 9th and 13th centuries, but most likely in the 16th century. In 1905, Jonathan Simpson restored, altered, and enlarged the barn for Lord Leverhulme, who listed it as a Grade II historic building.The Manor of Rivington was an estate in Rivington, Lancashire, England that may have existed before the Domesday Survey in 1086. In the early 12th century, the Pilkington family owned six plots of land called oxgangs. Over time, the manor was divided into two parts, and by the 16th century, the Pilkingtons of Rivington Hall owned three-quarters of the manor, while the Lathoms of Irlam owned a quarter and the Shaws owned a small fraction. Almonte is a town located in Lanark County, in the eastern part of Ontario, Canada. It's pronounced AL-mont, not al-MON-tay (just like the name of the famous Italian dessert).

This process happens when the air is heated and expands, and then cools and contracts. Throughout history, different types of hot air engines have been developed, including open-cycle engines like those invented by Sir George Cayley and John Ericsson, and closed-cycle engines like the one invented by Robert Stirling. Unlike internal combustion engines and steam engines, hot air engines use the expansion and contraction of air to generate power, rather than burning fuel or boiling water. Sir George Cayley was a very important English engineer who lived from 1773 to 1857. He is considered one of the most important people in the history of flying machines. Many people think he was the first person to understand how flying works and the first to use science to study flying. He is often called the first true scientific aerial investigator.Elliott J. Stoddard invented and patented two versions of the Stoddard engine, one in 1919 and the other in 1933. These engines are classified as external combustion engines, which means they use an external heat source to generate power. The engine has valves that control the flow of a single-phase gaseous working fluid (such as hot air) inside the engine. Initially, the internal working fluid was air, but modern versions may use other gases like helium or hydrogen. Charles Stephen Boreham was a New Zealand shearer and trade unionist born in Richmond, Tasmania, Australia on December 19, 1857. The gas-generator cycle is a type of power cycle used in bipropellant rocket engines. In this cycle, some of the propellant is burned in a special compartment called a gas generator, producing hot gas. This hot gas is then used to power the engine's pumps, which are responsible for moving the propellant around the engine. The hot gas is then released or exhausted, which is why this type of engine is also known as an open cycle engine. An external combustion engine (EC engine) is a type of engine where the working fluid is heated by burning fuel outside of the engine. This heat is then used to make the fluid expand and do work, like moving a car or powering a machine. The fluid is then cooled and reused (in a closed cycle), or it's cooled and replaced with new fluid (in an open cycle air engine).\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like further clarification. A working fluid is a substance that helps a machine work by providing pressure. Examples of working fluids include steam in a steam engine, air in a hot air engine, and hydraulic fluid in a hydraulic motor or cylinder. In general, any substance that can absorb or transfer energy in a thermodynamic system (like a machine) can be considered a working fluid. Celadon Leeds Daboll, an American from New London, Connecticut, invented the Daboll trumpet, a type of air trumpet foghorn. It was essentially a small, coal-fired hot air engine that compressed air in a cylinder on top of which was a reed horn. This design allowed the Daboll trumpet to produce a loud, distinctive sound. Piccard Balloons, along with other companies like Raven Industries (founded by Ed Yost), SEMCO, and The Balloon Works (now Firefly Balloons), were some of the first manufacturers of hot air balloons. Don Piccard, who comes from a family of aviation pioneers, started building and selling modern hot air balloons in the mid-1960s. Piccard Balloons played a significant role in the sport of hot air ballooning by introducing innovative designs and construction methods. A Manson-Guise engine is an enhanced version of a Manson engine, which is a type of hot air engine that converts a temperature difference into motion. The engine has two sides - a hot side and a cold side - and as long as there is a significant temperature difference between them, the engine will run. The Manson-Guise engine is one of the simplest types of hot air engines, with only a single con-rod and two pistons (a displacer piston and a power piston) that move in tandem. What's unique about Manson-Guise engines is that they can run in either direction (the flywheel can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise)."}], "output": "  Based on the passage provided, the prolific English engineer who contributed to the advent of the hot air engine by way of their open cycle devices is Sir George Cayley."},

According to a legend, the breed was created to resemble the lion in the city's crest, which is why it's known as a symbolic dog. Despite being part of the Working Group in dog shows like Crufts, the Leonberger is not included in the World Dog Show. The Basset Hound is a type of dog that belongs to the hound family. Originally bred for hunting hares, Basset Hounds have a strong sense of smell and can track their prey by following the scent on the ground. In fact, their ability to smell is almost as good as the Bloodhound's, which is the best of any breed. There are six recognized Basset-type breeds in France, where the Basset Hound originated.Dog Tales is a 1958 animated cartoon from Warner Brothers that features a series of funny blackout gags involving dogs. In one of the gags, a Doberman pinscher is seen viciously biting an overweight U.S. Army private who is also named Doberman (a reference to a character from a popular TV show). In another gag, the narrator can't decide whether a dog is a pointer or a setter, and then finally shows a picture of a point-setter. The cartoon also includes a basset hound who thinks she's a TV star, just like a popular dog character from a TV show at the time. We also learn about the unusual breed of a Newfoundland puppy's grandfather and see a great dane play the piano. Some of the animation in the cartoon was reused from other Warner Brothers cartoons, including one featuring Charlie Dog, who makes a cameo in his final appearance in a Warner Bros. cartoon. The voices of Mel Blanc, Robert C. Bruce, and Julie Bennett are heard in the cartoon, and it was directed by Robert McKimson and written by Tedd Pierce. Dog Tales was released in theaters on July 26, 1958. Barnyard Dawg, also known as George P. Dog, is a popular character from the Looney Tunes universe. He's a grown-up anthropomorphic basset hound, which means he's a dog with human-like characteristics. His arch-nemesis is Foghorn Leghorn, another well-known Looney Tunes character. Barnyard Dawg was created by Robert McKimson, who also created Foghorn, and was voiced by the talented Mel Blanc. In addition to his feud with Foghorn, Barnyard Dawg also has run-ins with other characters like Henery Hawk, the Weasel, Daffy Duck, and Sylvester. He appeared in 22 short animated films during the Golden Age of Warner Bros. production. The Transmontano Mastiff or Transmontano Cattle Dog is a rare breed of working dog from Portugal. They are known for their ability to protect flocks and herds, and they're particularly good at it because they're from a region where there are a lot of wolves. Although they're only found in a small area of Portugal, their ability to protect against wolves has made them popular in other parts of the world. The Bulldog is a medium-sized dog breed commonly known as the English Bulldog or British Bulldog. Other dog breeds that use their sense of smell include the Small Greek Domestic Dog, Irish Wolfhound, Bluetick Coonhound, Finnish Lapphund, and Basset Hound. The Bulldog is a strong and sturdy dog with a unique wrinkled face and a distinctive pushed-in nose. Organizations like the American Kennel Club (AKC), The Kennel Club (UK), and the United Kennel Club (UKC) keep track of breeding records for Bulldogs. In 2007, according to the AKC, Bulldogs were the fourth most popular purebreed dog in the US. Fred Basset is a popular comic strip featuring a male basset hound. The cartoon was created by the Scottish cartoonist Alex Graham and was first published in the Daily Mail on July 8, 1963. Since then, it has been widely syndicated around the world, entertaining readers of all ages. In the world of dog breeding, a breed standard is a set of guidelines that describe the ideal appearance, movement, and temperament for a particular dog breed. These guidelines are not based on scientific research, but are created by groups of dog enthusiasts called breed clubs for their own specific needs. Each breed club may have slightly different standards for their breed, and the standards may also vary between countries. Breed standards are similar to the guidelines used for other domesticated animals like cats or horses. Giant dog breeds don't have a standard height or weight classification, but some groups consider them to be any dog that weighs more than 50 kg. Giant breeds grow quickly, but it takes them longer to reach their full adult size than smaller dogs. Twelve states in the United States have chosen an official state dog breed. Maryland was the first state to designate a dog breed as a symbol, naming the Chesapeake Bay Retriever in 1964. The following year, Pennsylvania chose the Great Dane as its official breed. Most dog breeds are associated with the state where they originated. For example, North Carolina chose the Plott Hound because it is the only dog breed that is native to the state."}], "output": "  Great question!

Its name comes from the southern border of its territory, which was the Humber estuary. This kingdom existed from the 7th to the 11th century and was later transformed into an earldom as part of a larger unified English kingdom. In the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria, people spoke a dialect of Old English called Northumbrian. Along with Mercian, Kentish, and West Saxon, Northumbrian is one of the categories that modern scholars use to understand and classify Old English dialects.The Humberhead Levels are a big area of flat, low-lying land in northern England, near the western end of the Humber estuary. This area used to be a big lake called Glacial Lake Humber, which was surrounded by hills on all sides. Today, the levels are bordered by the Yorkshire Wolds to the east, a limestone escarpment called the northern Lincolnshire Edge to the north, and the southern part of the Yorkshire magnesian limestone ridge to the west. As you move north, the levels gradually merge into the slightly higher Vale of York, and to the south, they merge into the Trent Vale. South Ferriby is a small village located in North Lincolnshire, England. It's situated on the southern bank of the Humber Estuary, about 3 miles west of the Humber Bridge. Across the estuary is North Ferriby, which is located on the northern bank. According to the 2011 census, the population of South Ferriby is 651 people. The Essex dialect is a type of English language that's disappearing quickly, similar to some forms of East Anglian English. It's mostly found in the north and east of Essex, but it's not as common as it used to be. The dialect shares similarities with Suffolk and Norfolk dialects, but it has its own unique features. In the 20th century, there was a lot of urbanization in Essex, and the influence of the London accent grew stronger. This is why Estuary English, a milder version of the London accent, is now more common in the southern part of the county. As a result, the older generation in some areas may still use the rural Essex dialect, but it's not as widely spoken as it used to be. In other parts of Essex, the dialect and rural accent are still alive and well. Humberside was a non-metropolitan and ceremonial county in Northern England from 1974 to 1996. It was made up of land from both sides of the Humber Estuary, which is where it got its name. The county was created by combining parts of three other counties: East Riding of Yorkshire, West Riding of Yorkshire, and the district of Lindsey in Lincolnshire. The county council's main office was located in Beverley, which was inherited from the East Riding. The largest city and only real settlement in the county was Kingston upon Hull. The county stretched from one end of the Wold Newton area to the other, and while the county itself no longer exists, the Hull and Humber Ports city region still carries on its legacy. The Cumbrian dialect is a unique type of English spoken in the north of England, particularly in Cumbria (which includes the historic counties of Cumberland and Westmorland). It's important to note that this dialect is different from the extinct Celtic language called Cumbric, which was once spoken in the same area. While Cumbrian shares some similarities with other Northern English dialects, it has its own distinct sound and vocabulary. To help understand and learn this dialect, there are resources such as A Cumbrian Dictionary of Dialect, Tradition and Folklore by William Rollinson, as well as more modern and lighthearted dictionaries and phrase books like A Cumbrian Dictionary and Phrase Book. The Humber Forts are two large fortifications located in the mouth of the Humber estuary in northern England. These forts are called Haile Sand Fort and Bull Sand Fort. The M180 is a significant motorway in England that stretches for 25 miles from Junction 5 on the M18 motorway in Doncaster to a point near Humberside Airport, located about 10 miles from the port of Immingham and 14 miles from the port of Grimsby. This motorway provides access to several major routes, including Cleethorpes, Grimsby, Hull (via the Humber Bridge), Immingham, Lincoln, Scunthorpe, Humberside Airport, and the Killingholme Oil Refineries. The M180 is part of the unsigned Euroroute E22 and is the primary route along the south bank of the Humber Estuary. Being 25 miles long, it is the longest motorway in the UK with a three-digit number. The Humber Warhawks are a football team based in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, UK. They play in the BAFA NFC South 2 league and represent the counties of East Yorkshire and North East Lincolnshire.

They were given official status by the British American Football Association (BAFA) and started playing in the 2015 season."}], "output": "  The dialect of English spoken in the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria in the Humber estuary was Northumbrian.**"},

As of the 2010 census, the population was 60,316 people. The county seat is La Grange. The county is named after Colonel William Oldham. Interestingly, Oldham County was dry, meaning no alcohol was sold there, until 2005 when residents voted to allow alcohol sales in restaurants that seat at least 100 people and make at least 70% of their revenue from food sales. In 2015, voters in the county decided to make Oldham County a completely wet county, allowing alcohol sales in all establishments. Lake Louisvilla is a neighborhood located partially in Louisville, Kentucky, and partially in Oldham County. In the 1920s, the area was developed as a summer resort for people living in Louisville. However, in the late 1980s, the state of Kentucky drained the lake due to safety concerns about the stability of a nearby dam.Colonel John (Johannes) Bowman was a pioneering American figure who lived in the 18th century. He served as a colonial militia officer, sheriff, and justice of the peace in Lincoln County, Kentucky. In 1781, he presided over the first county court in Kentucky and was appointed as the first county-lieutenant and military governor of Kentucky County during the American Revolutionary War. Colonel Bowman also fought in the American Revolution, serving under General George Rogers Clark on multiple occasions, including during the Illinois Campaign, which expanded the United States' territory. Benjamin Logan was an important figure in American history, born in Shelby County, Kentucky around 1742. During the American Revolutionary War, he served as colonel of the Kentucky County, Virginia militia and was second-in-command of all militia forces in Kentucky. Additionally, he played a key role in Kentucky's quest to become a state, as a leader in the state's efforts to gain independence from Virginia. Benjamin's brother, John Logan, also played a significant role in Kentucky's history, serving as the state's first treasurer. The Battle of Blue Licks, which took place on August 19, 1782, was one of the last battles of the American Revolutionary War. This battle occurred about 10 months after the famous surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, which effectively ended the war in the east. On a hill near the Licking River in what is now Robertson County, Kentucky (but was then part of Kentucky County, Virginia), a group of about 50 American and Canadian Loyalists and 300 American Indians launched a surprise attack on a group of 182 Kentucky militiamen. This was the last victory for the Loyalists and Natives during the frontier war. John Logan was a notable figure in American history, born in Virginia in 1747 and later moving to Kentucky. He played a key role in Lord Dunmore's War in 1774, fighting alongside his brother Benjamin. After settling in Kentucky County, Virginia, Logan took part in several expeditions against the Shawnee tribe, including ones led by famous frontiersmen like Daniel Boone, John Bowman, and George Rogers Clark. After Kentucky County was divided into three counties, Logan represented his home county, Lincoln, in the Virginia House of Delegates and attended several conventions that led to the separation of Virginia from Kentucky. Tara Elizabeth Conner (born December 18, 1985) is an American actress, model, and beauty queen. She was crowned Miss USA in 2006 and has also competed in the Miss Teen USA and Miss Universe pageants. In addition to her role as Miss USA, Conner has worked as a model. She was featured on the TV series Bikini Destinations in 2004, posing in Lake Tahoe. Conner has held several other titles, including Miss Kentucky Teen USA 2002, Miss Kentucky County Fair 2004, and Miss Kentucky USA 2006. Casey County is a county located in the United States Commonwealth of Kentucky. According to the 2010 census, the population of Casey County was 15,955 people. The county seat is Liberty, and the county was formed in 1806 from the western part of Lincoln County. Casey County is named after Colonel William Casey, a pioneer settler who moved to Kentucky in 1779. Interestingly, Casey County is the only county in Kentucky that is entirely part of the Knobs region. The county is also home to the annual Casey County Apple Festival and is a dry or prohibition county, meaning that alcohol sales are not allowed within its borders. Finally, Casey County is considered part of the Appalachian region of Kentucky. In 1776, the state of Virginia divided a county called Fincastle into three new counties: Kentucky, Washington, and Montgomery. Before this, the area that is now Kentucky was part of Fincastle County. The new counties were created on December 31, 1776, and each one had its own government seat. For the first three and a half years, the seat of government for Kentucky County (also known as Kentucke County) was a place called Harrodstown (which was later renamed Harrodsburg). In 1780, during the American Revolutionary War, a group of Dutch settlers were attacked and killed by Native Americans in what is now Kentucky. The attack, known as the Westervelt Massacre, occurred around 3:00 am on June 27th in Kentucky County, Virginia (which is now the state of Kentucky). This was one of the largest massacres in Kentucky history. The settlers were traveling from Low Dutch Station to Harrod's Town, which was a fortified settlement, in an attempt to escape the invading British army led by Captain Henry Bird. Unfortunately, the settlers were ambushed and attacked by surprise after a day's journey of twelve miles. The exact location of the massacre is not known, but it's believed to have taken place at Floyd's Fork and Broad Run. The attack resulted in the deaths of seventeen settlers, including ten members of the Westervelt family. The Native Americans responsible for the massacre were allied with the British and received payment for each victim's scalp they cut off and returned to the British authorities. This tragic event had a lasting impact on the region, leading some settlers to join Colonel George Rogers Clark's militia in response."}], "output": "  The Kentucky county with a population of 60,316 and featuring the Lake Louisvilla neighborhood is Oldham County."},

The company provided electricity to much of central and northern Florida. In 2000, Florida Progress merged with Carolina Power & Light to form Progress Energy. Then, in 2012, Progress Energy merged with Duke Energy. Today, the operations in Florida are known as Duke Energy Florida. The Crystal River Energy Complex is located near the mouth of the Crystal River in Citrus County, Florida, and covers an area of about 4,700 acres (1,900 hectares). This complex contains five power plants: Crystal River 1, 2, 4, and 5, which generate electricity using fossil fuels, and Crystal River 3, which is the only nuclear power plant on the site. The complex was developed in the early 1960s by Florida Power Corporation and was sold to Progress Energy Inc in 2000.

The Sabal Trail Transmission Pipeline is a proposed natural gas pipeline that will run from central Alabama to Orange County, Florida. A small portion of the pipeline is owned by two energy companies, NextEra Energy and Duke Energy, who have been working on the project since before 2011. In 2013, Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) awarded NextEra Energy and Spectra Energy the contract to build the pipeline. Duke Energy later bought a stake in the project in 2015. Construction on the pipeline began in September 2016, and it is currently expected to be finished and in service by June 2017. Duke Power, now known as Duke Energy, created a forestry department in 1939 to manage the company's land that wasn't used for power generation. In 1963, this department became known as South Carolina Land and Timber. As the company's land holdings expanded to include North Carolina, the name was changed to Crescent Land and Timber in 1969. Some of the original land was sold to Crescent Land and Timber by the Singer Corporation. In the mid-1980s, the company changed its name to Crescent Resources as it began developing residential communities. Crescent Resources started work on its first commercial development, Coliseum Centre, in 1990. By 1991, Crescent Resources managed 270,000 acres of land. The company sold part of its land, including some that became Lake James State Park, to the state of North Carolina. In 2006, Duke Energy sold its 49% stake in Crescent Resources to Morgan Stanley, making Crescent Resources a separate entity from Duke Energy. Crescent Resources filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and emerged from it in 2013, renaming itself Crescent Communities.

The fourth season of the show started on January 4, 2015, on RTÉ One and lasted until April 26. Kathryn Thomas returned as the main host, and she was joined by Eoghan McDermott, who also co-hosted the show. Two popular TV personalities, Bressie and Kian Egan, returned as coaches, along with The Saturdays singer Una Healy and S Club 7 star Rachel Stevens, who filled the remaining two coaching positions. The show was produced by Shinawil Productions, just like in previous seasons. The Saturdays were a British-Irish girl group formed in London, England in the summer of 2007. The group consisted of five members: Frankie Bridge, Una Healy, Rochelle Humes, Mollie King, and Vanessa White. They were signed to Fascination Records, a record label that also owned a sub-division of Polydor Records, after their management team gave them an instant record deal. As soon as the contract was finalized, The Saturdays went on tour with the girl group Girls Aloud during their Tangled Up Tour. The group's music style is primarily pop, but their management team experimented with dance-pop and electropop to create their sound. Songwriters Ina Wroldsen, Steve Mac, and Quiz & Larossi were heavily involved in creating their music.Girls Aloud, a popular British-Irish girl group, have performed in six concert tours throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland. They have played in some of the biggest venues in the region, including arenas that can hold thousands of people. Vanessa White (born October 30, 1989) is a British singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. She became famous in 2008 as a member of the popular girl group The Saturdays, signed to Fascination and Polydor Records. The group has had many hit songs and even reached number one on the charts. Vanessa is the youngest member of the group. The Saturdays, a British-Irish girl group, released a single called Forever Is Over in October 2009. The song was available for digital download on October 3rd and was released on CD the following day. The group worked with songwriters Louis Biancaniello, Kahmarl Gordon, Sam Watters, and James Bourne to create the track, which was produced by The Runaways. Forever Is Over was the lead single from the group's second studio album, Wordshaker. The Saturdays' debut EP, Headlines!, was released in Ireland and the UK in August 2010. This collection of songs includes some of their previous hits, like Forever Is Over and Ego, as well as a remix of One Shot from their previous album Wordshaker. The EP also features five brand new songs recorded in 2010, including a cover of Died in Your Eyes by Kristinia DeBarge. Before the EP's release, the group had already released the lead single, Missing You, which became their seventh top-ten hit in both the UK and Ireland. The Saturdays' third studio album, On Your Radar, was released on November 21, 2011, through Fascination Records. The album was recorded in Los Angeles and London with the help of several producers and songwriters, including Steve Mac, who has worked with the band on their previous albums. Other collaborators include Lucas Secon, Taio Cruz, Labrinth, Tracklacers, Space Cowboy, Brian Higgins, and Lucie Silvas. The song Higher by The Saturdays was released in 2010 as part of their debut EP, Headlines!. The song was written and produced by Ina Wroldsen and Arnthor Birgisson, and it was confirmed to be the EP's second single when it came out on November 1st of that year. Before the single was released, it was remixed to feature new vocals from the American rapper Flo Rida.

He was the lead singer, lead guitarist, and main songwriter of the band Creedence Clearwater Revival. During their time together from 1968 to 1972, the group had nine top-ten singles and eight gold albums. In 1993, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Park Mi-yeon, known professionally as Serri, is a South Korean singer, songwriter, and actress born on September 16, 1990. She is more commonly known for her role as a member and leader of the popular South Korean girl group Dal Shabet.Joseph Fogerty Sr. was a prominent Irish builder and architect who lived in Limerick in the 19th century. He was born in Limerick and came from a family of builders. He was the father of Robert Fogerty and George J. Fogerty, and the brother of John Fogerty (an engineer) and uncle of Joseph Fogerty (a novelist) and William Fogerty (an architect in Dublin). Joseph designed and built the Theatre Royal in Limerick and Henry Street in the city. From the 1870s until his death, he worked with his son Robert in the architectural firm Joseph Fogerty & Son. John Fogerty was a skilled craftsman from Ireland who lived in the 19th century. He was a millwright, architect, builder, and civil engineer, and was active in Limerick during the early to mid-1800s. He was the brother of Joseph Fogerty, Sr. and the father of three sons: Joseph, William, and John Frederick. After many years of work, John Fogerty retired from his career as an architect sometime between 1870 and 1879. Almost Saturday Night is a song written by John Fogerty and first released on his album in 1975. It was later released as a single and reached #78 on the charts. Many other artists have also covered the song, including Dave Edmunds, who released it as a single and had more success with it. Other artists who have covered Almost Saturday Night include Gene Clark, Ricky Nelson, The Searchers, and The Georgia Satellites. John Frederick Fogerty (1863-1938) was an Irish architect and engineer who worked in various locations including Limerick, London, Shropshire, Bournemouth, Pretoria, and Zambia during the mid to late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was born in Limerick and was the son of an architect and the grandson of an engineer. Fogerty earned a degree in engineering from Queen's College, Cork in 1883 and later attended the South Kensington Art School. He worked under the supervision of Sir Thomas Drew and established his own office in Wellington, Shropshire in 1889. In 1893, he partnered with Reginald George Pinder in Bournemouth and later merged his practice with Pearce & Parnell of Bournemouth in 1902. Fogerty emigrated to South Africa in 1914 and served in various military posts during World War I, including in South Africa, the Isle of Wight, Palestine, and Poona, India. After the war, he worked as an engineer in the Public Works Department in Pretoria before becoming borough surveyor in Lusaka, Zambia in 1926, where he passed away in 1938. Duke Tumatoe, whose real name is William Bill Severen Fiorio, was born in 1947 and is an American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He has played with many famous musicians, including Muddy Waters, Bo Diddley, B.B. King, Willie Dixon, Buddy Guy, John Fogerty, and George Thorogood. In addition, Duke was a founding member of the popular arena-rock band REO Speedwagon.

Duke typically performs more than 200 shows per year. John Fogerty, an American singer-songwriter known for his roots rock music, released a compilation album called The Long Road Home: The Ultimate John Fogerty/Creedence Collection on November 1, 2005. The album brings together songs from both Fogerty's solo career and his work with the band Creedence Clearwater Revival. The title of the album signifies Fogerty's return to Fantasy Records, where he had previously released music before moving to Warner Bros. Records and then DreamWorks Records. John Fogerty, the former lead singer of Creedence Clearwater Revival, wrote a song called Rockin' All Over the World for his second solo album. The song was released as a single in 1975 and reached the top 40 in the US, peaking at number 27. A music critic named Dave Marsh from Rolling Stone magazine thought the song was a good choice for the album's lead single, but he also thought it was a bit formulaic and just repeated the title over and over like a chant. Another band called Status Quo recorded their own version of the song on their 1977 album, giving it a heavier arrangement. John Fogerty's second solo album, released in 1975, was titled after the artist himself. John Fogerty was released by Asylum Records in the US and Fantasy Records internationally. Just like his previous work with Creedence Clearwater Revival, the album features a mix of original songs and cover tunes. Interestingly, John Fogerty himself prefers to call the album Old Shep, which is a nod to his pet dog Shep, who is featured on the album cover along with him."}], "output": "  Serri and John Fogerty are not related.\n\nSerri is a South Korean singer, songwriter, and actress known professionally as Park Mi-yeon, or more commonly as Serri.

It's held every four years and is organized by FIFA, the international governing body of football. The first tournament was held in China in 1991, and it's been held every four years since then. Liu Ailing (born June 2, 1967) is a former Chinese professional footballer who played for the China national team in several major international tournaments. She competed in the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1991, 1995, and 1999, and won a silver medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. In addition, she participated in the 2000 Sydney Olympics. A skilled playmaking midfielder, Liu played for clubs in both Japan and the United States during her professional career.The women's football team of The Gambia represents the country in international competitions. However, the team has not played in any official FIFA matches, despite the fact that women's football has been growing in the country since 1998. The Gambia has two youth teams, an under-17 side that has participated in FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup qualifiers and an under-19 side that withdrew from regional qualifiers for an under-19 World Cup. Developing a national women's football team faces challenges that are common throughout Africa, although the national football association has four staff members dedicated to women's football. The EAFF E-1 Football Championship is an international football tournament for national teams in East Asia. It's held every year and includes both men's and women's teams. The competition is organized by the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF). So, if you're a fan of women's football, you'll be excited to know that there's a special tournament just for women's national teams, held alongside the men's competition. The EAFF E-1 Football Championship, previously known as the East Asian Football Championship from 2003 to 2010 and the EAFF East Asian Cup from 2013 and 2015, is an international football competition for countries in East Asia that are members of the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF). Before the EAFF was established in 2002, the top four teams in East Asia played against each other in the Dynasty Cup, which was considered the unofficial East Asian Championship. There are separate competitions for men and women, with the first edition held in 2003 and 2005, respectively. In 2005, there was also a combined points competition where the results of the men's and women's teams were added together, excluding qualifiers. Geraldine Geri Donnelly is a former Canadian soccer player born on November 30, 1965. She played as a midfielder and represented Canada in the FIFA Women's World Cup in 1995 and 1999. In 1996 and 1999, she was named Canadian Player of the Year. Donnelly was part of the Canadian team that won the CONCACAF Women's Championship in 1998. She was inducted into the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame in 2014. The 1929-30 British Home Championship was an annual football tournament between the British Home Nations (England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland). However, this particular edition of the tournament was significant because it occurred during the same year as the first FIFA World Cup, held in Uruguay. The Home Nations were not part of FIFA because they didn't think professionalism in continental and South American football was a good thing. They were also not interested in competing against foreign teams, considering them too weak for a serious contest. It's interesting to imagine what would have happened if the Home Nations had participated in the World Cup, especially since the tide of global football was shifting away from Britain. The English team, which dominated the Home Championship that year, had previously lost to Spain, and the Scottish side, which had won many of the previous championships, was also unprepared and struggled in games played outside the British Isles. The 2016 L'Alcúdia International Football Tournament was a football competition that took place in July and August 2016. This was the first year that the tournament featured only international youth teams, unlike previous editions which included both national selections and club teams. The Togo women's national football team (French: Équipe du Togo féminine de football) represents the Togolese Republic in international women's football competitions since 2006. Togo is managed by the Fédération Togolaise de Football (FTF), the governing body of football in Togo. Unfortunately, the team has only played a few FIFA-recognized matches, all in 2006, under the leadership of current manager Paul Zoungbede. Togo's home stadium is the Stade de Kégué, located in the capital city of Lomé. The Women's Nordic Football Championship was an annual international football tournament for women's national teams from the Nordic countries. The tournament started in 1974 and continued until 1982. Initially, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden participated, but Norway joined in 1978. Unfortunately, Iceland and the Faroe Islands did not take part in the competition."}], "output": "  The international football competition for women that Liu Ailing played in the 1991, 1995, and 1999 editions is the FIFA Women's World Cup.**"},

He is best known for his novels, including The Sportswriter and its sequels Independence Day, The Lay of the Land, and Let Me Be Frank With You. Ford is also known for his short story collection Rock Springs, which includes some of his most popular and widely anthologized stories. Richard Ford's collection of short stories, Rock Springs, published in 1987, explores the impact of dysfunctional parents on their adult sons. The stories focus on the narrators' struggles to come to terms with their mothers and fathers, who are often depicted as flawed and emotionally distant. Through these characters, Ford examines the complex and often fraught relationships between parents and children, and the ways in which these relationships shape the narrators' identities and worldviews.Stephen Baxter's Vacuum Diagrams is a collection of science fiction short stories that explores the Xeelee Sequence universe. The stories are connected and provide a deeper understanding of the history of the universe and mankind's place in it. Each short story is independent, but they are also connected by a framing device that involves a character named Jack Raoul witnessing events in the stories as told by a god-like being. The collection begins with an introduction, and the short stories are interspersed with scenes from Eve, a character who provides context and introduces the next section. The collection won the Philip K. Dick Award in 1999.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

It contains eight short stories and two full-length novels, all of which are part of the Robot series and take place in the Foundation universe. Interestingly, Asimov decided to title the collection The Rest of the Robots because he had previously published another collection of short stories about robots, called I, Robot, the year before. However, none of the stories in The Rest of the Robots were included in I, Robot, and all of them were later included in another collection called The Complete Robot. Both of the novels in the collection, The Caves of Steel and The Naked Sun, were also published separately. Ambulance (originally titled Ambulanse) is a collection of short stories by Norwegian author Johan Harstad, published in 2002. Eleven stories make up the collection, which are all connected to each other in various ways. In one story, the main character appears as an extra in the next, while others are told from different perspectives. The book's central theme is an ambulance driving through an unnamed city, which ties the stories together. J.J. Syvrud was born on May 10, 1977, and is a former American football player who played one season in the National Football League (NFL).

He was born on October 12, 1857, and was one of the most popular and prolific authors of the late 19th century and the Edwardian period. Marsh is best known for his supernatural thriller novel The Beetle, which was published in 1897, the same year as Bram Stoker's Dracula. Initially, The Beetle was even more popular than Dracula and remained in print until 1960. Marsh wrote nearly 80 volumes of fiction and numerous short stories in various genres, including horror, crime, romance, and humor. Many of his works have been re-published in recent years, starting with The Beetle in 2004. Interestingly, Marsh's grandson Robert Aickman was also a well-known author of short, strange stories. Richard Henderson Honaker was nominated by President George W. Bush on March 19, 2007, to become a U.S. District Judge for the District of Wyoming. The American Bar Association's judicial evaluation committee gave Honaker their highest rating, well qualified, for the nomination. Honaker was recommended for the position by U.S. Senator Craig L. Thomas of Wyoming, who passed away three months later. Honaker had even helped co-chair Thomas' reelection campaign in Rock Springs in 2006. However, Honaker's confirmation never occurred due to the succession of President Barack Obama, which ended his candidacy. If he had been confirmed, Honaker would have taken over the position currently held by Judge Clarence A. Brimmer in Cheyenne. Instead, Nancy D. Freudenthal was later nominated and confirmed to the same seat. Flannery O'Connor's collection of short stories, A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories, was first published in 1955.

In the article, Freud argues that it's no coincidence that some of the most influential works of literature, including Oedipus Rex, Hamlet, and The Brothers Karamazov, all deal with the theme of parricide. Freud believes that Dostoevsky's epilepsy is connected to this theme in his work. Oedipus Rex, also known as Oedipus the King, is an ancient Greek play written by Sophocles around 429 BC. The original title in Greek was simply Oedipus, but it was later renamed Oedipus Tyrannus to distinguish it from another play called Oedipus at Colonus. In ancient times, the term tyrant referred to a ruler, but it didn't necessarily have a negative connotation.In 1899, Sigmund Freud wrote a book called The Interpretation of Dreams (German: Die Traumdeutung). In this book, Freud introduced his theory of the unconscious mind and how it relates to dream interpretation. He also discussed what would later become known as the Oedipus complex. Freud revised the book at least eight times, and in the third edition, he added a section that explained dream symbolism in a very literal way, influenced by Wilhelm Stekel. Freud believed that this work was a once-in-a-lifetime breakthrough in understanding the hidden meanings of dreams. In 1988, a biography called Freud: A Life for Our Time was written by historian Peter Gay about the founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud. This book builds upon new information that has come to light since a previous biography, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud by Ernest Jones, was published in 1953. While the book has received praise, some authors have criticized it because they are skeptical of psychoanalysis. Hamlet, one of Shakespeare's most famous plays, has been widely studied and analyzed for over 400 years. The character of Hamlet has had a significant impact on the field of psychology, particularly through Sigmund Freud's interpretation of the Oedipus complex. In fact, Hamlet's influence on literature is also notable, as few characters in Shakespeare's plays have become as iconic as Hamlet. As Foakes notes, the name Hamlet has become a noun, symbolizing a particular attitude towards life. Paul Ricœur's 1965 book Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation (French: De l'interprétation. Essai sur Sigmund Freud) is a study of Sigmund Freud's ideas. This book is sometimes classified with other works like Jürgen Habermas's Knowledge and Human Interests (1968). While Freud and Philosophy has received praise, some people have criticized Paul Ricœur for misunderstanding Freud's ideas. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson's book, The Assault on Truth: Freud's Suppression of the Seduction Theory, argues that Sigmund Freud intentionally ignored his early hypothesis that hysteria in children was caused by sexual abuse during infancy. Masson came to this conclusion after studying some of Freud's unpublished letters while working as the director of the Sigmund Freud Archives. The book was first published in 1984 and has since been updated in several revised editions. Richard Webster's book Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis (1995, 1996, 2005) offers a critical perspective on Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. Webster contends that Freud became a kind of religious figure and that psychoanalysis is actually a pseudoscience that is connected to the Judaeo-Christian tradition. Webster agrees with Gilbert Ryle's arguments against mentalist philosophies in The Concept of Mind (1949) and criticizes other authors for their handling of Freud and psychoanalysis. Webster's book has been praised for its brilliance and definitiveness, but it has also been criticized for some scholarly shortcomings and argumentative weaknesses. Why Freud Was Wrong played a significant role in the ongoing controversy surrounding psychoanalysis, known as the Freud wars. Peter J. Swales is a Welsh historian of psychoanalysis who was born in 1948. He has written essays and letters about Sigmund Freud, and in 1998, an article in The New Republic magazine praised his remarkable detective work over the past 25 years. Swales has uncovered the true identities of several early patients of Freud's who were known only by their pseudonyms. He is one of three men, along with Kurt R. Eissler and Jeffrey Masson, who are mentioned in the 1984 book In The Freud Archives. This book began as two articles in The New Yorker magazine, which sparked Masson to file an unsuccessful $10 million lawsuit against the magazine and its writer, Janet Malcolm. Ernest Jones' biography of Sigmund Freud, The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud, is considered one of the most influential biographies of Freud. It was first published in three volumes between 1953 and 1957, and later abridged into a single volume in 1961 by literary critics Lionel Trilling and Steven Marcus. When the book was first released, it was well-received and sold more than expected. However, some critics have argued that Jones presented an overly positive portrayal of Freud in his biography."}], "output": "  According to Sigmund Freud's 1928 article, the work of literature \"Oedipus Tyrannus\" (also known as \"Oedipus the King\") by Sophocles is a work of literature that deals with the theme of parricide."},

She was highly regarded for her natural and expressive singing style, as well as her clear and precise diction. Badia was considered one of the greatest interpreters of 20th century Catalan, Spanish, and Latin American art song, and she premiered many works in this genre, including pieces by Enrique Granados, Manuel de Falla, Frederic Mompou, Alberto Ginastera, and Enric Morera. These composers had written many of their works specifically for her voice, and Badia's collection of sound recordings, scores, letters, and photographs is now housed at the Biblioteca de Catalunya.

Karel Dežman, also known as Dragotin Dežman or Karl Deschmann, was a prominent political and scientific figure in 19th-century Carniola, which is now part of Slovenia. He was born on January 3, 1821 and died on March 11, 1889. Dežman was a key figure in the development of politics, culture, and science in the region during this time. He is considered one of the founders of modern archeology in Slovenia and made significant contributions to botany, zoology, mineralogy, geology, and mineralogy. He was the first director of the Provincial Museum of Carniola, which is now known as the National Museum of Slovenia. However, Dežman's political views changed over time, and he became known as a symbol of national renegadism due to his shift from Slovene liberal nationalism to Austrian centralism and pro-German cultural stances."}], "output": "  The city that contains the Yunnan Provincial Museum is also known by the nickname \"Spring City.\""},

At the top of the column is a cross placed above a flaming crown, making for a striking and imposing sight. The Florence Baptistery, also called the Baptistery of Saint John, is a special religious building in Florence, Italy. It's an octagonal shape and is located in two important squares in Florence: Piazza del Duomo and Piazza San Giovanni. This means it's right across from the famous Florence Cathedral and the Campanile di Giotto, a famous bell tower. Because of its importance, the Baptistery has been given the special status of a minor basilica.The Column of Phocas (Italian: Colonna di Foca) is a big column in the Roman Forum in Rome, Italy. It was built before a platform called the Rostra and dedicated to the Eastern Roman Emperor Phocas on August 1, 608. This column is the last addition made to the Roman Forum. It stands 44 feet tall on a white marble base. The column is made of Corinthian columns, which are known for their intricate designs. It's believed that the column was originally made in the 2nd century for another building, but it was later reused for the Column of Phocas. The base of the column was also reused from an earlier statue dedicated to a different emperor named Diocletian. The original inscription on the base was removed to make room for a new inscription honoring Phocas. The Colonna dell'Abbondanza is a large column located in the Piazza della Repubblica in Florence, Tuscany, Italy. This impressive monument is located in the heart of the city and is a popular tourist attraction.

It is most commonly seen in the early evening hours after brief periods of rain in the afternoon. The name Gollum comes from a character in J.R.R. Tolkien's book The Lord of the Rings. J.R.R. Tolkien, a renowned English author and scholar, wrote The Lord of the Rings, an epic fantasy novel that has become a beloved classic. Initially intended as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings grew into a much larger and more complex work over time. Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, this novel has sold over 150 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling novels of all time.Suanfa tongzong (General Source of Computational Methods) is a book written by Chinese mathematician Cheng Dawei in 1592. The book contains 595 problems divided into 17 chapters and is primarily focused on basic arithmetic using the abacus. This book was a primary source of information for scholars studying mathematics in China's mathematical tradition. Six years after publishing Suanfa tongzong, Cheng Dawei released another book called Suanfa zuanyao (A Compendium of Calculating Methods), which mostly duplicated the content of four chapters of the first book with some reorganization. The popularity of Suanfa tongzong was so great that it led to an increase in the cost of paper and the publication of pirated copies with errors. This prompted Cheng Dawei to release an abridged version of the book. Gollum is a fictional character created by J.R.R. Tolkien, a famous author of fantasy stories. He was first introduced in Tolkien's 1937 book The Hobbit, and later became a key character in the sequel, The Lord of the Rings. Gollum was once a regular Hobbit named Sméagol who lived near a beautiful river called the Gladden Fields. However, he was corrupted by a powerful magical ring and eventually became known as Gollum due to his strange, guttural noise-making habit. The idea proposed by Anthony Aguirre and Max Tegmark is that quantum mechanics can be interpreted in a way that's relevant to the never-ending expansion of the universe, called cosmological inflation. According to this interpretation, the wavefunction for a quantum system doesn't just describe a bunch of imaginary possibilities for what the system could be doing, but actually represents the real-life copies of the system that exist in the infinite space of the universe. These copies are identical to each other, and they're all spread out across the vast, ever-expanding space.\n\nOne cool thing about this idea is that it means the collapse of the wavefunction, which is a big mystery in quantum mechanics, can actually be avoided. And the strange, random nature of quantum mechanics that we experience in our everyday lives can be understood as our limited ability to see which of these infinite copies of ourselves is the one having the experiences we think of as real. It's a pretty mind-blowing idea, don't you think? Andy Serkis, the actor who voiced Gollum in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, initially agreed to provide a voice-over for the character for a three-week period. However, his work on the films ended up lasting for five years, as he poured his heart and soul into bringing Gollum to life. Throughout the book, Serkis discusses various aspects of his work on the franchise, including the inspiration for Gollum's distinctive cough and the challenges of acting alongside computer-generated imagery (CGI). He also addresses the debate over whether he should have been nominated for an Academy Award for his work as Gollum. Machine Head's third album, The Burning Red, is the band's second best-selling album in the US, selling as many copies in just three years as their earlier album Burn My Eyes sold in almost eight years (from 1994 to 2002). In total, The Burning Red has sold over 134,000 copies in the US and was certified silver by the BPI (British Phonographic Industry) in 2011 for reaching sales of 60,000 in the UK. Gollum is a genus of sharks found in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. In 1973, a biologist named Leonard Compagno discovered this genus and named it after the character Gollum from J.R.R. Tolkien's stories. The species Gollum attenuatus, or the slender smooth-hound, has a similar shape and habits to Gollum, which is why Compagno chose this name. The genus Ingerophrynus includes 12 species of true toads found in southern China, Indochina, and Southeast Asia. These species are found in places like Yunnan, Thailand, Malaysia, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, Nias Island, Sulawesi, and the Philippines. The genus was created after a major revision of frog taxonomy, and ten of the species in this genus were previously thought to be part of the genus Bufo. In 2007, a new species called Ingerophrynus gollum was added to the genus, which is named after the character Gollum from J.R.R. Tolkien's books. From Unknown Worlds is an anthology of fantasy fiction short stories edited by John W. Campbell, Jr. and illustrated by Edd Cartier. This book was the first of several anthologies that drew from the classic magazine Unknown, which was published in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1948, the book was first released in magazine format by the American company Street & Smith, with a print run of 300,000 copies. However, despite selling better than the original Unknown magazine, too many copies were returned, causing the publisher to decline reviving the magazine. A British edition of the book was later published by Atlas Publishing in 1952, but it omitted one of the stories, titled 'One Man's Harp.'"}], "output": "  The answer to your question is: ** 150 million copies.**\n\nThe Ingerophrynus gollum, a true toad species found in Southeast Asia, was named after the character Gollum from J.R.R.

They're best known for their hit song Barbie Girl from 1997, which made them famous all over the world. The group was formed in 1989 and released three albums: Aquarium in 1997, Aquarius in 2000, and Megalomania in 2011. According to estimates, they've sold around 33 million albums and singles, making them the most successful Danish band of all time. In 2002, Mattel filed a lawsuit against MCA Records over the song Barbie Girl by the band Aqua. This was because the song was released in 1997 and Mattel felt that it was too similar to one of its popular children's songs. The case went back and forth between the court and the parties involved, but ultimately, the case was dismissed.Daze is a Danish music band that was popular in the late 1990s. Their debut album, Super Heroes, released in 1997, became a huge hit and sold over 31,000 copies on its first day. The band consists of three members: Lucas Sieber, Jesper Tønnov, and Trine Bix. Their music style is similar to the Danish pop band Aqua, and they are known for their upbeat and catchy tunes. Super Heroes was published in Scandinavia by Sony Music and later released in other countries through Columbia Records and Epic Records. The album included hit singles such as Superhero, Tamogotchi, and Toy Boy. In February 1998, Daze won a Danish Grammy Award for Best Dance Album of 1997, and their single Superhero was nominated as the Danish hit of the year by G.A.F.F.A. magazine. The album was also very popular in Argentina during that time.

Gibb or Reynolds v. Sims? \n\n Passage: In the landmark Supreme Court case Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the Court ruled that state legislative districts must be roughly equal in population when electing any chamber of a state legislature. This decision overturned the traditional role of state senates, which allowed rural areas to balance out the influence of large cities. The case was brought by a voter in Alabama named M.O. Sims, who argued that the unequal distribution of population in Alabama's state legislative districts unfairly gave more power to urban areas. The ruling had a significant impact on both northern and southern states, as many had failed to reapportion their legislatures in line with changes in state population. In the landmark case of Selle v. Gibb (1984), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit established an important principle regarding the doctrine of striking similarities. The court ruled that while copying must be proven by showing both access and substantial similarity, if there is no evidence of access, striking similarities can raise an inference of copying. This is done by showing that the similarities between the two works could not have been the result of independent creation, coincidence, or a common source. In other words, striking similarity alone is not enough to infer access, but if the similarities are so striking that they preclude the possibility of independent creation, it can raise an inference that the works were copied.The first case to be heard by the United States Supreme Court was West v. Barnes, 2 U.S. 401 (1791), which was the first Supreme Court decision ever made. This case was significant because it introduced the practice of oral arguments in the Supreme Court. The case was argued on August 2, 1791, and the decision was made on August 3, 1791. However, there were two other cases that were docketed with the Court around the same time, but they were settled before the Court could hear them: Van Staphorst v. Maryland (1791) and Collet v. Collet (1791). Unfortunately, the justices' full opinions in West v. Barnes were not published in the Supreme Court Reporter, but instead were summarized in newspapers at the time. In the Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd case, the House of Lords ruled on the concept of qualified privilege in English defamation law. This refers to situations where the publication of defamatory statements is allowed in the public interest, even though it may harm the reputation of the person being criticized. The case involved a newspaper publishing a statement that was potentially defamatory, but the court ruled that the publication was justified because it was in the public interest. George Reynolds was an important leader in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1842 to 1909. He served as a general authority, which is a high-level position within the church, and was also the church's secretary to the First Presidency, which is the church's highest governing body. Additionally, Reynolds was involved in a significant legal case called Reynolds v. United States, which was the first case about freedom of religion to be heard by the United States Supreme Court. The Jameel case was a significant judgment in English defamation law, delivered by the House of Lords. In this case, the court reaffirmed an important principle established in a previous case called Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd. This principle states that the media has a right to publish information that is in the public interest, even if it is defamatory. In other words, if the media can show that it published information that was of significant public interest, it can defend itself against a defamation lawsuit. The Jameel judgment further solidified this principle and provides a clear defense for the media in libel cases. In the landmark case of Reynolds v. United States (98 U.S. 145, 1878), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that religious beliefs cannot be used as a defense in a criminal trial. This case was significant because it was the first time the Supreme Court addressed the issues of an impartial jury and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.   During Chief Justice Morrison Waite's tenure on the Supreme Court (from March 4, 1874 to March 23, 1888), the Court heard an extraordinary number of criminal cases. In fact, the Court heard 106 criminal cases in just 14 years, which is almost as many cases as it heard in the entire time between its creation and Waite's appointment as Chief Justice. Some of the notable cases the Court heard during this time include United States v. Cruikshank (1875), United States v. Reese (1875), Reynolds v. United States (1878), Wilkerson v.

He is the leader of the Sinn Féin political party and has been a member of the Irish parliament, called the Dáil Éireann, since 2011. During the Northern Ireland peace process, there were a series of conversations between John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, and Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Féin. These talks, known as the Hume-Adams dialogue, aimed to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.Sinn Féin Republican Youth (previously known as Ógra Shinn Féin) is the youth wing of the Irish political party Sinn Féin. This organization is active and organized throughout both Ireland and the United Kingdom. Republican Sinn Féin (RSF) is an Irish political party that follows the legacy of the original Sinn Féin party founded in 1905. In 1986, there was a split in the party, and RSF was formed. Today, RSF claims to be the continuation of the original Sinn Féin. However, RSF members do not recognize the legitimacy of the Northern Ireland (Stormont) or Republic of Ireland (Leinster House) parliaments, even though they take seats on local Irish councils when elected. This means that RSF does not register itself with these parliaments. The Volunteer Political Party (VPP) was founded in Northern Ireland on June 22, 1974, by members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), a paramilitary group that had been banned by the unionist government in 1966. The VPP was led by Ken Gibson, a former internee and ex-chief of staff of the UVF. The group was established after the success of the Ulster Workers Council Strike, which showed some UVF leaders that they had political power and potential. The VPP was created to further develop this potential and explore a political path for Loyalist and Republican paramilitary groups. The Labour Secretary of State, Merlyn Rees, legalized the UVF in April 1974, allowing the group to participate in the political process alongside Sinn Féin.   The leader of Sinn Féin, also known as the Uachtarán Shinn Féin or President of Sinn Féin, is the most important politician in the Sinn Féin political party in Ireland. Currently, Gerry Adams has been holding this position since November 13, 1983, after Ruairí Ó Brádaigh resigned as leader of the party. Sinn Féin is the third-largest political party in the Irish parliament, known as the Oireachtas. The leader of Sinn Féin chooses a group of elected representatives, called TDs (Members of Parliament) and Senators, to speak on behalf of the party on different issues. These representatives have areas of responsibility similar to those of government ministers, meaning they are responsible for specific areas of policy and decision-making. Sinn Féin is an Irish political party founded in 1905 by Arthur Griffith. The name Sinn Féin means We Ourselves in Irish, but it's often mistranslated as Ourselves Alone. Over the years, Sinn Féin has become a symbol of various forms of Irish nationalism, particularly Irish republicanism. However, the party has experienced significant splits in 1922 during the Irish Civil War and again in 1969 at the beginning of the Troubles. These splits had a profound impact on politics in Ireland. Today, Sinn Féin is a left-wing and secular party that is still committed to republicanism.   The Workers' Party (formerly known as Official Sinn Féin) is a political party in Ireland with Marxist-Leninist beliefs. The party started when there was a divide within Sinn Féin, which was founded in 1905, and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in 1969-70. This split led to the creation of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and Provisional Sinn Féin. At the time of the split, the leaders of the Officials were Cathal Goulding and Tomás Mac Giolla. The Iraqi National Dialogue Council is a political party made up of smaller Sunni parties that came together to participate in the 2005 constitution drafting process in Iraq. The party was founded by Saleh al-Mutlaq and Khalaf al-Ulayyan, and it received guidance from Sadoun al-Zubaydi, a well-known Iraqi foreign policy expert and former translator to Saddam Hussein. However, before the 2005 elections, Mutlaq left the National Dialogue Council and formed his own party with a similar name, while Ulayyan continued to lead the original party. Today, the Iraqi National Dialogue Front is the smallest of the three parties that make up the Iraqi Accord Front (Tawafuq) coalition, which includes parties from the wider Arab-populated region of Iraq."}], "output": "  The president of the Sinn Féin political party during the Hume-Adams Dialogue was Gerry Adams.**"},

The battle was fought between American troops, including the 2nd and 3rd Divisions, along with French and British forces, against various German units, such as the 237th, 10th, 197th, 87th, and 28th Divisions. This battle has become an important part of the history and mythology of the United States Marine Corps. The Battle of Peleliu, also known as Operation Stalemate II, was a major conflict fought during World War II between the United States and Japan. It took place on the island of Peleliu in the Mariana & Palau Campaign from September to November 1944. The U.S. military fought against the Empire of Japan in this battle, which was a crucial part of the war in the Pacific.  Clifton B. Cates (born Clifton Bledsoe Cates on August 31, 1893) was a highly respected senior officer in the United States Marine Corps. He served as the 19th Commandant of the Marine Corps from 1948 to 1951 and was recognized for his bravery during both World War I and World War II. At the Battle of Belleau Wood, he was honored for his heroism, and at the Battle of Iwo Jima, he demonstrated exceptional leadership. Cates is considered one of the most distinguished young officers of the Great War, and he achieved a rare feat by commanding a platoon, company, battalion, regiment, and division in combat. The USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), also known as the Devil Dog, was the second ship named after a famous battle during World War I. The ship was built in Mississippi and the construction began on March 5, 1973, at Ingalls Shipbuilding. She was launched on April 11, 1977, and was officially commissioned on September 23, 1978, with Captain T.C. Steele in command. St Elmo Murray Haney was a highly respected Master Gunnery Sergeant in the United States Marine Corps. As a veteran of many early battles, he was considered an example of the old-fashioned Marine spirit and a source of inspiration during difficult times. His fellow Marine, Eugene Sledge, described Haney as being everywhere at once, always ready to help correct mistakes and offer support. Haney fought in some of the toughest battles of World War II, including the Battle of Belleau Wood with the 5th Marine Regiment. He also served in other places such as Shanghai, France, Nicaragua, Iceland, and the Amazon during his time in the Marines. Two ships of the United States Navy have been named Belleau Wood, after a significant battle during World War I. The Battle of Belleau Wood took place near Château-Thierry in France, and it was a pivotal moment in the war. To honor the bravery and sacrifice of the American soldiers who fought there, the Navy has chosen to name two of its ships after this historic battle.   The Battle of Norfolk was a major tank battle fought during the Persian Gulf War on February 27, 1991, between American and British forces and the Iraqi Republican Guard. The United States' 2nd Armored Division (Forward) and 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized), along with elements from 11 other Iraqi divisions, clashed in this battle. The British 1st Armored Division protected the right flank of the VII Corps and faced off against the Iraqi 52nd Armored Division and multiple infantry divisions. This battle was significant because it was the final confrontation of the war before a unilateral ceasefire took effect, and it has been recognized as the second-largest tank battle in American history and the largest tank battle of the Gulf War. A total of 12 divisions participated in the Battle of Norfolk, with American and British forces destroying approximately 750 Iraqi tanks and hundreds of other combat vehicles. Additionally, the 3rd Armored Division destroyed 250 enemy vehicles and captured 2,500 Iraqi soldiers at Objective Dorset on February 28, 1991. It was not until over a decade later that quality references became available for these battles, and the scale of the land battles during Operation Desert Storm was much larger than many of the battles fought in southern and western Europe during World War II, in terms of the quantity of equipment involved. The American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) was the US Army's expeditionary force during World War I. It was created on July 5, 1917, in France under the leadership of General John J. Pershing. The AEF fought alongside the French, British, Canadian, and Italian armies on the Western Front against the German Empire. A small number of AEF troops also fought against the Austro-Hungarian Army in Italy. The AEF played a significant role in helping the French Army on the Western Front, particularly during the Aisne Offensive (at the Battle of Château-Thierry and Battle of Belleau Wood) in the summer of 1918. The AEF's major actions took place in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive towards the end of 1918. The USS Belleau Wood was a United States Navy aircraft carrier that played a significant role in both World War II and the First Indochina War. Active from 1943 to 1945 in the Pacific Theater during World War II, the ship was also temporarily used by the French Navy during the First Indochina War, where it was known as Bois Belleau. The Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and Memorial is located in Belleau, Northern France, on a 42-acre site where the Battle of Belleau Wood took place during World War I.

The original wooden floor of the loft is still intact and has been caulked with oakum and bitumen. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is the naval branch of the Australian Defence Force. After Australia federated in 1901, the ships and resources of the separate colonial navies were combined into a single national force called the Commonwealth Naval Forces. Initially intended for local defense, the navy soon took on a broader role in protecting the region. In 1911, the navy was granted the prestigious title of Royal Australian Navy, signifying its growing importance in Australia's defense. Over time, the navy has continued to evolve and expand its responsibilities, becoming a crucial part of Australia's defense strategy.The Vietnam People's Navy (Vietnamese: Hải quân nhân dân Việt Nam), also known as the Vietnamese Navy or Vietnamese People's Navy, is the naval branch of the Vietnam People's Army.

Admiral Tan Sri Dato' Sri Mohd Anwar bin Haji Mohd Nor is the Chief of Defence Force (CDC) of Malaysia. This is significant because he is the first CDC to come from the Royal Malaysian Navy (TNM), rather than the traditional choice of a 4-star General from the Royal Malaysian Army (TNM). For over five decades, the CDC has always been chosen from the Army. Admiral Anwar broke this tradition by being appointed as the first Navy Admiral to hold this position.

Wheat allergy is an allergy that can affect people when they eat wheat or are exposed to it through their work. This allergy can cause a number of symptoms, including hives, nausea, and difficulty breathing. It's important to note that wheat allergy is different from celiac disease, which is an autoimmune disorder that also affects the digestive system. While celiac disease is caused by an immune reaction to a protein in wheat called gliadin, wheat allergy is caused by an immune reaction to other proteins in wheat, such as serine protease inhibitors, glutelins, and prolamins. There are many different proteins in wheat that can cause an allergic reaction, and researchers have identified 27 potential wheat allergens. The most severe reaction to wheat is exercise-induced anaphylaxis, which can be triggered by one specific protein called omega gliadin. Other common symptoms of wheat allergy include urticaria (hives) and atopy (itchy skin). It's important to note that gluten sensitivity is not the same as wheat allergy, and it's not caused by the same proteins.

Bean salad is a common cold salad made with a variety of cooked beans, such as green beans, yellow wax beans, chickpeas, and kidney beans. It's usually mixed with fresh onions, peppers, or other vegetables and dressed with a vinaigrette sauce that's sometimes sweetened with sugar. You can also make a pickled version of bean salad. Some people refer to this type of salad by the number of different beans it contains, like Three Bean Salad or Four Bean Salad. The term Bean Salad can also be used to describe other dishes that don't have beans, like ones made with barley, pasta noodles, or rice. Pandanus conoideus is a plant in the pandan family that grows in Papua, Indonesia. The local people in Papua call the fruit kuansu, while Indonesians refer to it as buah merah (which means red fruit). To prepare the fruit, the Papuans typically split it open, wrap it in leaves, and then cook it in a special earth oven. Jell-O salads (also known as gelatin salads, jelly salads, congealed salads, or molded salads) are a type of salad made with flavored gelatin, fruit, and sometimes grated carrots or other vegetables. Sometimes, other ingredients like cottage cheese, cream cheese, marshmallows, nuts, or pretzels are added to the mix. These salads were popular in the 1960s. Candle salad was a popular fruit salad in America during the 1920s to 1960s. It's made with a few simple ingredients: lettuce, pineapple, banana, cherry, and either mayonnaise or cottage cheese (or both). To make the salad, arrange a few leaves of lettuce on a plate or decorative napkin first. Then, stack pineapple rings on top of the lettuce, creating a space for a peeled banana (or half banana). Finally, top the banana with your choice of cream (such as whipped cream) and a cherry for garnish. It's a simple but delicious vintage salad that's easy to make!"}], "output": "  Red apple.**"},

M. Barrie? \n\n Passage: Sir James Matthew Barrie, a Scottish novelist and playwright, was born on May 9, 1860, and passed away on June 19, 1937. He is best known for creating the character of Peter Pan, a magical boy who has adventures in Neverland. Barrie was born and educated in Scotland, but he moved to London, where he wrote many successful novels and plays. It was there that he met the Llewelyn Davies boys, who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has exciting adventures in Kensington Gardens (as seen in The Little White Bird). Later, Barrie wrote the famous play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, which tells the story of an ageless boy named Peter and his ordinary friend Wendy, who have incredible adventures in the imaginary land of Neverland. Edward Franklin Albee III was a famous American playwright who lived from March 12, 1928, to September 16, 2016. He is best known for writing plays like The Zoo Story (1958), The Sandbox (1959), Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962), and A Delicate Balance (1966). Albee's plays were very successful, and three of them won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. In addition, two of his plays won the Tony Award for Best Play.Reed Adalbert Albee was an American businessman who was born on September 8, 1885, and passed away on August 2, 1961. He is most famous for being the adoptive father of the well-known playwright Edward Albee and for being a member of a wealthy and influential family on the East Coast who owned several theaters. The Edward F. Albee Foundation was established by playwright Edward Albee in 1967, after his play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? became very successful and brought in a lot of money.

This play was a major success and was translated into five languages and produced in ten countries. Gelber continued to work and write in New York, where he also taught writing, directing, and drama at various universities, including Brooklyn College and the City University of New York. In 1999, he received an award called the Edward Albee Last Frontier Playwright Award in recognition of his achievements in the field of theatre. The Oppenheimer Award, also known as the Newsday George Oppenheimer Award or Oppy, was named after the late playwright and Newsday drama critic George Oppenheimer. This award was given annually to the best New York debut production by an American playwright for a non-musical play. A group of well-known playwrights, including Edward Albee, Wendy Wasserstein, James Lapine, and Richard Greenberg, made up the selection committee. The award came with a $5,000 cash prize.

The Zoo Story is a one-act play written by American playwright Edward Albee in 1958. It was his first play, and he finished it in just three weeks. The play explores themes of loneliness, miscommunication, and the struggles of connecting with others in a world that often values commercialism over human connection.

The term originated in the world of Italian opera, where impresarios were responsible for hiring musicians, singers, and other performers, as well as designing costumes and sets, all while taking financial risks. In the 18th and 19th centuries, impresarios were often noble amateurs who ran theatres, and they played a key role in organizing the annual opera season. Impresarios were known to be highly involved in the creative process, and they often produced and composed their own works. For example, Antonio Vivaldi acted as both impresario and composer, managing seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice and creating operas such as Orlando finto pazzo.\n\nI hope this helps!

A freight forwarder, also known as a non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC), is like a coordinator for shipments. They help individuals or businesses get their goods from the manufacturer or producer to the final destination, such as a store or customer. The forwarder doesn't move the goods themselves, but instead works with different carriers (like trucking companies, airlines, or railroads) to get the goods there. Think of it like a travel agent for shipments! They contract with these carriers to move the goods and often use multiple modes of transportation (like truck, plane, and train) to get the job done. For instance, a forwarder might arrange for cargo to be picked up from a factory and transported to an airport by truck, then flown to the final destination and delivered to a customer's doorstep by another truck.

A financial plan is an overall assessment of an individual's current income and future financial situation. It uses information that is already known to predict how much money the individual will have in the future and how they will spend it. A financial plan often includes a budget, which helps organize an individual's finances and shows how they can spend and save their money in the future. The plan also decides how much money will be set aside for different expenses, like rent or utilities, and how much will be saved for short-term and long-term goals, like retirement or college. Sometimes, a financial plan is also called an investment plan, but it can also focus on other important areas of personal finance, like managing risk, estates, or retirement.

These shrubs are evergreen and can grow up to 3 feet tall and wide. The leaves are arranged in a spiral pattern along the stems and are shaped like lancelets, with a pointed tip and a serrated edge. In the spring, the young leaves are often brightly colored. The flowers are bell-shaped and white or pink, growing in clusters up to 5 inches long. After the flowers bloom, the shrubs produce woody capsules that split open to release many small seeds. Phlebodium is a small group of ferns that contains only two to four species, and these species are found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. These ferns are closely related to another genus called Polypodium, and they used to be classified under that genus too.The genus Sinopieris belongs to the family Pieridae, which means they are a group of butterflies. Sinopieris can be found in several countries, including Nepal, Tibet, Yunnan, Gansu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan. In the past, all six species of Sinopieris were classified under the genus Pieris. However, scientists have found that Sinopieris and Pieris have some distinct differences in the pattern of veins on their wings. Specifically, Sinopieris has a light grey or blackish band that covers a portion of the wing, while Pieris has either a single black spot or a pair of black spots on the same area. Additionally, Sinopieris does not have any black spots on its hindwings, while Pieris does.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. The Andromeda lace bug, scientifically known as Stephanitis takeyai, is a pest that affects plants in the Pieris genus, particularly Pieris japonica, which is a type of Japanese andromeda. This bug originated in Japan and has since spread to other parts of the world. However, at least one Pieris species, Pieris floribunda, is resistant to the bug. Leptosporangiate ferns are the largest group of living ferns, with around 11,000 species found worldwide. They belong to the subclass Polypodiidae, but are sometimes classified as the class Pteridopsida or Polypodiopsida. These ferns are one of the four main groups of ferns, along with Eusporangiate ferns, which include the marattioid ferns (Marattiidae, Marattiaceae), horsetails (Equisetiidae, Equisetaceae), and whisk ferns and moonworts. Pieris floribunda is a type of shrub that grows in North America. It's part of the Ericaceae family, which includes blueberries. The common names for this shrub are mountain fetterbush or mountain andromeda. All parts of the plant are poisonous if eaten, so it's not something you want to eat. It's hard to grow in gardens because it's hard to propagate, or make new plants from. However, some specialty and native plant nurseries sell it, even though it can be difficult to grow. In gardens, it prefers full to partial shade and should be planted in a location that's not too windy. It also needs soil that's rich in organic matter and has a slightly acidic pH, between 4.5 and 6.5. The genus Pieris, commonly known as whites or garden whites, is a widespread and almost cosmopolitan group of butterflies. There are the most species of this genus in the Palearctic region. Many species of Pieris have caterpillars that feed on plants in the Brassicaceae family, such as cabbage. Scientists have studied the special relationship between Pieris caterpillars and these plants for over 100 years. It turns out that Pieris caterpillars have adapted to feed on plants containing chemicals called glucosinolates. In fact, they have become so specialized that they won't eat any other food unless it contains these chemicals. The females of the Pieris species also check for the presence of glucosinolates before laying eggs on a plant. While some species of Pieris are considered pests and have spread to many parts of the world, there are also species that are not pests and only feed on specific native vegetation in North America, such as Pieris oleracea and Pieris virginiensis. The Indian cabbage white butterfly, Pieris canidia, belongs to the family Pieridae. This butterfly is closely related to another species in the same family, Pieris rapae. Phlebodium aureum, also known as the golden polypody, golden serpent fern, cabbage palm fern, or gold-foot fern, is a fern that grows on other plants or structures, like trees. It's found in tropical and subtropical areas of the Americas, including the eastern part of North America (from Florida to Georgia) and parts of South America (like Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and Paraguay). This fern is unique to North America, while other species of Phlebodium are only found in South America. Some other names for this fern include calaguala (in Spanish), laua'e haole (in Hawaiian), samambaia (in Portuguese), and hartassbräken (in Swedish). Tree ferns are a type of fern that grows with its trunk elevated above ground level. Most tree ferns belong to the families Dicksoniaceae, Metaxyaceae, and Cibotiaceae in the order Cyatheales. However, some other ferns in different families, such as those in the Osmundaceae family, can also be considered tree ferns if they have short trunks under a meter tall. Additionally, ferns in the genera Blechnum, Calochleana, Cnemedaria, Culcita (the only tree fern species found in Europe), Cystodium, Leptopteris, Lophosoria, Sadleria, Thyrsopteris, and Todea could also be classified as tree ferns under a broader definition of the term."}], "output": "  Yes, you are correct! Phlebodium and Pieris are both species of ferns. Phlebodium is a small group of ferns that contains only two to four species, and is found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. Pieris, on the other hand, is a genus of butterflies that contains many species found throughout the world, including the Indian cabbage white butterfly (Pieris canidia). Both Phlebodium and Pieris are unique and distinct from one another, with different characteristics and habitats."},

The bridge was built in 1889 by Charles A. Allen, a civil engineer for the city of Worcester, at the request of Edwin Bartlett, a local textile mill owner. The bridge is 30 feet long and 42 feet wide, with an elliptical arch reaching a height of 13 feet above the river. The facing of the bridge is made of rough-cut granite that has been fixed with mortar, while the granite stones that make up the arch have been precisely worked. The bridge has parapet walls made of large granite slabs that are 4.5 feet, 2 feet wide, and 1 foot thick.   Worcester is a city located in Massachusetts, United States. It is the county seat of Worcester County and was named after Worcester, England. According to the 2010 Census, the city's population was 181,045, making it the second most populous city in New England after Boston. Worcester is situated approximately 40 miles west of Boston, 50 miles east of Springfield, and 40 miles north of Providence. Due to its central location in Massachusetts, Worcester is often referred to as the Heart of the Commonwealth. This nickname is reflected in the city's official symbol, a heart, which may also have roots in local lore about the invention of the mass-produced Valentine's Day card in the city.The Sutliff Bridge is a historic bridge located in Sutliff, a small community near Lisbon, Iowa. It was built in 1897 and 1898 at a cost of around $12,000. The original engineer for the bridge was J.R. Sheely. In 1983, a modern replacement bridge was built over the Cedar River, and the old bridge was slated for demolition. However, it was later saved and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Although the bridge was a popular spot for both locals and visitors, it was damaged by massive floods in 2008. The floods caused one of the bridge's spans to be washed away, and it is estimated that it will cost around $1.7 million to repair it. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed to help fund the repairs, with FEMA providing most of the money and the local government and donations covering the rest. The bridge was reconstructed by VJ Engineering of Coralville, Iowa, and construction was completed by Iowa Bridge and Culvert of Washington, Iowa. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held in October 2012 to reopen the bridge to the public after four years of closure. The Gardnerville Branch Jail is a historic jail located at 1440 Courthouse Street in Gardnerville, Nevada. The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915. Before 1910, the county had no jail, so prisoners were held in a local judge's granary, which was not suitable for housing prisoners. The community petitioned the county to build a new jail, but some local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, opposed the move, thinking Gardnerville was trying to take over the county seat. Despite these protests, the county approved the construction of the new jail. The jail housed its first prisoners even before it was finished, as the Genoa jail burned down and one prisoner was temporarily chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him. Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail. The Cerro Gordo County Courthouse is located in Mason City, Iowa, USA. In 1855, Mason City was chosen as the county seat when Cerro Gordo County was created. However, some people in the western part of the county were unhappy with this decision, so the Iowa legislature appointed three new commissioners to move the county seat to a different location called Livonia. A courthouse was built there.\n\nLater, a petition with over half of the county's citizens' signatures asked to move the county seat back to Mason City. In an election held in 1858, Mason City won with 155 votes to 48. Prior to the current Modernist courthouse that was occupied by the county in 1960, there were two other courthouses in Mason City. The current building was actually a former Standard Oil building that the county acquired for $159,400 in 1959 and then remodeled for its use. The Old Allamakee County Courthouse in Lansing, Iowa, was the former county courthouse of Allamakee County. The courthouse was built in 1861 during a dispute between Lansing and Waukon over which community should be the county seat. In 1859, Waukon won a vote on the county seat, but Lansing challenged the result and won another vote in 1861 after teaming up with the nearby community of Columbus. However, Waukon built its own courthouse in the meantime, and the county seat battle continued. In 1866, the Waukon sheriff attempted to seize the county records from the Lansing courthouse, but a posse from Lansing stopped him. The Iowa Supreme Court later ruled in favor of Waukon, and the county seat has remained there since. The Henry Covered Bridge near Bartlett, Ohio is a historic covered bridge that's worth checking out. It's located off of TR61, which is a road that connects to OH550, southeast of Bartlett in Washington County, Ohio. This bridge is unique because it's a Multiple Kingpost truss type, which means it has special supports underneath the bridge to help keep it stable. It's also 45 feet long and was built all the way back in 1894, making it a really old and interesting bridge to visit. The Shinn Covered Bridge is a historic wooden covered bridge located in the southeastern part of Ohio. It's situated in the countryside northeast of Bartlett in Washington County. The bridge was built in 1886 by a local carpenter named Charles T. Shinn, who used a unique design that combines the Burr Truss and king post truss styles. The bridge is made of weatherboarded walls, stone abutments, and a metal roof, and features vertical siding. The portals of the bridge have remained vertical and stable over time, even though the creek beneath it has changed course. The Shinn Covered Bridge spans 98 feet across the western branch of Wolf Creek in Palmer Township, and it's believed that Shinn built it soon after one of his children drowned in the creek. Despite the tragic event, Shinn was able to complete the bridge, which has become a beloved landmark in the area. The Eisenhower Bridge is located near Milton, Iowa, and spans the Fox River. It was built in 1887 after supervisors from Des Moines and Lee counties met to plan a new bridge over the Skunk River on the Burlington-Fort Madison Road. Unfortunately, financing for the new bridge was delayed, so the counties agreed to split the costs equally. The bridge was designed by a well-known engineer named Horace B. Horton and was constructed by the James B. Diver Bridge Company of Keokuk, Iowa. Initially, the bridge was a two-span structure, but it was replaced in 1930 and one of the spans was relocated to the current location. Despite losing some of its historical significance, the bridge remains an important example of early wagon bridge construction and one of the few iron truss bridges left in Iowa. In 1998, the bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The Main Street Bridge in Charles City, Iowa is a historic structure that spans the Cedar River for 248 feet. Before the bridge was built, people had to cross the river using a ferry or a ford during the summer and ice in the winter. The first bridge at this location was destroyed during a flood while it was still under construction in 1858. The second bridge was completed in 1864 but was also destroyed in a flood two years later. A temporary bridge was built in 1867, and a truss bridge was completed in 1870. Despite an engineer's recommendation to replace the bridge in 1892, it was used for 40 years. In 1908, the Floyd County Board of Supervisors approved a new bridge, but construction was delayed due to contract issues. The old bridge was moved to a new location downstream in 1909, and Advance Construction Company of Waukesha, Wisconsin was hired to build the new bridge. The three-span concrete-filled spandrel arch bridge was designed by engineer G.W. Miller and was completed in 1910 for around $40,000, which was paid for by the county and the city. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999."}], "output": "  The engineer who built Bartlett's Bridge in Massachusetts was Charles A.

These novels, which include Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur, and The Singapore Grip, explore the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. Louis Aragon was a famous French poet who played a key role in the surrealist movement in France. He co-founded a magazine called Littérature with two other writers, André Breton and Philippe Soupault, in 1919. Aragon was not only a poet, but also a novelist and editor, and he was a member of the Communist Party and the Académie Goncourt, a prestigious literary organization in France. He was born on October 3, 1897 and passed away on December 24, 1982.The Murree Rebellion of 1857, also known as the Indian Independence War, was a conflict between the tribes surrounding the Hill Station of Murree (now in Pakistan) and the colonial government of British India. The rebels were frustrated with the British rule, which had been in place for many years, and there had been several isolated uprisings against them. In 1857, these uprisings came together and gained momentum, with many people feeling that they could overthrow the colonial rule. Although the rebellion was not centrally coordinated, it had a sense of national unity and purpose, which made it seem like a much larger and more significant event than it actually was. According to Niger's Constitution of 1999, the country is committed to protecting the basic human rights outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, human rights groups both within and outside Niger have expressed concerns about the government, military, police, and traditional practices that go against the 1999 constitution. During the period of French colonial rule (1900-1960) and after Niger gained independence in 1960, citizens had limited political rights and lived under arbitrary government power. Although things have improved since Niger returned to civilian rule, there are still criticisms about the state of human rights in the country. In 1985, Hong Kong introduced a new electoral system that allowed for the first time for indirect election to the colonial legislature. This was done during the final years of British colonial rule in Hong Kong. The plans for this reform were first proposed in a document called the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong, which was released in July 1984, just before the Sino-British Joint Declaration in December. This new electoral system laid the groundwork for a more democratic government in Hong Kong, which continued to develop during the final years of colonial rule and continued to evolve after Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. Léo Ferré's album Songs of Aragon (French: Les Chansons d'Aragon) was released in 1961 by Barclay Records. This was Ferré's second album dedicated to a poet, following Baudelaire's Flowers of Evil in 1957. However, unlike his previous album, which featured poetry by Charles Baudelaire, Ferré's new album focuses on the work of Louis Aragon, a former surrealist poet. While Aragon's poetry collection The Unfinished Novel (French: Le Roman inachevé) is not surrealistic itself, Ferré's interpretations of these poems showcase his unique ability to bring lyrical life to the written word. The Sri Lankan Civil War has its roots in the longstanding tension between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities in Sri Lanka. Before and during colonial rule by Europeans, the island was divided into three separate kingdoms, and there was a cycle of war and peace between them. However, after Sri Lanka gained independence, the minority Tamils were left at the mercy of the majority Sinhalese, who were also the warring parties. According to Jonathan Spencer, a social anthropologist at the University of Edinburgh, the war is a result of how ethnic identities have been created and recreated since colonial times, with the political struggle between the Tamils and the Sinhala-dominant government accompanied by disputes over historical sites and place names, and the use of the past for political gain. Fort Diu is located on the west coast of India in the Union Territory of Diu, which is administered by the Government of India. The fort was built by the Portuguese during their colonial rule of the Diu island, which started in 1537 and lasted for an incredible 424 years - the longest colonial rule in history! The town of Diu is located to the west of the fort. The fort was built in 1535 after a defense alliance was formed between the Sultan of Gujarat and the Portuguese, and it was strengthened over the years until 1546. In December 1961, the Portuguese were forced to quit Diu during a military operation called Operation Vijay launched by the Indian government, and Diu was merged with India and became a centrally administered Union Territory. L'Affiche rouge is a song from the album Les Chansons d'Aragon, released in 1961 by French singer-songwriter Léo Ferré. The lyrics are based on a poem titled Strophes pour se souvenir, written by Louis Aragon in 1955 to commemorate the opening of a street in Paris named after 23 members of the French Resistance who were executed by the Nazis in 1944. The street was named rue du Groupe Manouchian in their honor. The term Affiche rouge became associated with the Resistance during World War II, when the Germans distributed thousands of red posters throughout Paris denouncing these individuals as immigrants and Resistants. Mwambutsa IV Bangiricenge was the king (also known as the mwami) of Burundi from 1915 to 1966. He became king after his father, Mutaga IV Mbikije, died in 1915. Mwambutsa was born during a time when Burundi was under German colonial rule, but he ruled during a period when Belgium was in charge of Burundi (from 1916 to 1962). The Belgians had a policy of indirect rule, which meant they kept the kings of both Burundi and its neighboring country, Rwanda, in power."}], "output": "  The answer to your question is: Louis Aragon."},

The show is about a special group of creatures called gargoyles who turn to stone during the day and live in medieval Scotland. After being petrified for a thousand years, the gargoyles are awakened in modern-day New York City and become the city's secret protectors at night. Gargoyles the Movie: The Heroes Awaken is a direct-to-video animated film produced by The Walt Disney Company. This movie is actually a collection of five pilot episodes from the animated TV series Gargoyles, edited together to create a single feature-length film. Due to time constraints, some scenes were removed from the original episodes and rearranged for the film. Additionally, some dialogue was changed to make the movie flow better. The episodes were produced and aired in 1994, and the movie was released on laserdisc and VHS in February 1995. Since the pilot episodes have been released as part of Season 1 of Gargoyles on DVD, it's unlikely that this feature will be released separately again.Desert kites are structures built in the Middle East to trap and hunt wild animals. The Bedouin people have called them The Works of the Old Men and they can be found across the deserts of Syria, Jordan, southern Israel, and Saudi Arabia. These structures are made of long walls made of rocks that come together at a narrow neck, creating a small enclosed space. The walls can stretch for hundreds of meters and are best seen from the air. They were given their name by pilots who first spotted them in the 1920s, and over 2,000 have been identified in Jordan and Syria. While some have been dated to be around 3-5 thousand years old, newer studies suggest that they are actually much younger, around 1,000-2,000 years old. This means that the mass hunting did not occur in prehistory, but rather during a later period when people were already growing most of their food. There is also evidence of rock art near some of the kites, which suggests that the hunt was a large social effort done by people from several settlements and may have had religious significance. The 2000 Race of a Thousand Years was a long-distance race that took place on December 31, 2000, at the Adelaide Street Circuit in Australia. This race was the final event of the 2000 American Le Mans Series and was held on the full 3.780-kilometer (2.349-mile) Grand Prix circuit used for the Australian Grand Prix between 1985 and 1995. The race was supposed to last for 1,000 kilometers (621 miles), but it was stopped early, two hours before midnight, after covering 850 kilometers (531 miles). Donald Miller, the author of six books including A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, hit a slump after his previous book became successful. Instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, Miller felt unmotivated and lost his purpose. He was approached by two movie producers who wanted to turn his book into a film, and it was during this time that Miller had important realizations about his life and purpose. The book, which is subtitled What I Learned While Editing My Life, centers on the insights Miller gained while adapting his memoir Blue Like Jazz into a movie screenplay, directed by Steve Taylor. Escalante Petrified Forest State Park, located in Utah, USA, is a state park that's about a half-mile north of the town of Escalante. The park was established in 1991 and features a visitor center with displays of fossilized plants and marine life, including petrified wood and dinosaur bones that are over 150 million years old. The park's Petrified Forest Trail is a one-mile loop that takes visitors up a mesa to a spot where most of the fossil wood can be found. Along the trail, you can see logs that are two feet or more in diameter eroding from the conglomerate cap on the mesa. These logs are believed to be from conifers that were transported by a river before being buried and fossilized. The park is home to one of the most complete fossil logs known from the Morrison Formation, which is 50 feet long and located near the trailhead. The logs in the park are multicolored and were prized by collectors before the park was established. Beer has been brewed in Hungary for over 1,000 years, dating back to the Middle Ages. However, in recent times, most of the beer produced in Hungary is mass-produced rather than crafted by small, traditional breweries. Despite this shift towards industrialization, Hungary has a rich history of commercial beer production, with beer having been made there for nearly a thousand years. Rainbow Girl, a fictional DC Comics character, is a superheroine from the planet Xolnar. She first appeared in Adventure Comics #309 in 1963 as a rejected applicant to the Legion of Super-Heroes. After 25 years, she reappeared in Who's Who in the Legion of Super-Heroes #5 as a socialite. Rainbow Girl didn't appear again for almost 20 years until Action Comics #862, where she was introduced as a member of the Legion of Substitute Heroes, a group of teenage heroes that exists in a future universe. The Quaternary Period (the most recent one) is the current period of the Cenozoic Era according to the geologic time scale used by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS). It started 2.588 million years ago and is still ongoing. Quaternary is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene (from 2.588 million years ago to 11,700 years ago) and the Holocene (from 11,700 years ago to the present). The term Late Quaternary refers to the past 0.5 to 1 million years. In the TV series Babylon 5, there are a series of wars called the Shadow Wars. These wars involve a group called the Shadows. The Shadows have been fighting wars in the galaxy for a long time, every thousand years or so. They believe that conflict is the way to grow and expand their power. During the first two seasons of the show, the term Shadow War usually refers to a previous war that happened a thousand years ago. The war that's happening in the series itself is called the Coming Shadow War because it's going to happen soon, but it hasn't started yet. In the later seasons, the war is simply called the Shadow War."}], "output": "  Sure!

It's located in the City of Westminster, which is in the heart of London. The palace is the center of important events and royal hospitality. It has been a symbol of national celebration and mourning for the British people many times throughout history. The Waterloo Vase is an impressive urn made of Carrara marble, standing at an impressive 15 feet (5 meters) tall and weighing a whopping 20 tons. Since 1906, it has been beautifully displayed in the gardens of Buckingham Palace in London, serving as a stunning ornament.A bird bath is a artificial pond or small pool that's specifically designed for birds to drink from, bathe in, and cool off. It's usually made of a water-filled basin, and it can be a decorative garden feature, a small reflecting pool, or even a piece of outdoor art. By providing a bird bath, you can create a vital wildlife garden that attracts birds and helps them stay healthy and happy.   A whirligig is a spinning or whirling object that can be powered by the wind, friction, or a motor. It is also known as a pinwheel, buzzer, comic weathervane, gee-haw, spinner, whirlygig, whirlyjig, whirlybird, or simply whirligig. Whirligigs can be used as decorative garden ornaments that move in the wind, but they can also be designed to transmit sound and vibrations into the ground to repel burrowing rodents in yards, gardens, and backyards. Achalla is the capital of Awka North, a Local Government Area in Anambra State, south-central Nigeria. It consists of eight villages: Umudiani, Amukabia, Odawa, Umuogbe, Umunagu, Umuezede, Udezu, and Amadim. The current monarch of Achalla is HRH Igwe Alex Nwokedi (OON), but the traditional monarchical heritage of Achalla is traced back to the MUOLOKWU dynasty in Odawa village. According to history, Achalla migrated from Arochukwu kingdom in present-day Abia state. Additionally, some Achalla people migrated to form a community known as Achalla-ibuzo in present-day Delta state. Some notable sons of Achalla include the current King, Igwe Alex Nwokedi, who was a former chief press secretary to former Head of State, General Olusegun Obasanjo, and Comptroller Edwin U. Achum (retired), who was a philanthropist and known as the Ozumba 1 of Achalla. His residence was once used as the secretariat of the local government until a permanent structure could be built.

These ornaments can take many forms, such as statues, fountains, bird baths, and more. They are used to add beauty and interest to outdoor spaces, and can be chosen to match the style and theme of the surrounding area. Whether you're looking to add a touch of elegance or whimsy to your garden, garden ornaments are a great way to do it! Wind chimes are a type of instrument made from suspended tubes, rods, or other objects that are typically made of metal or wood. These objects are hung outside a building or residence and are designed to produce sound when the wind blows against them. The tubes or rods are suspended from a weight or surface, which causes them to strike each other when the wind blows, creating a unique and random sound. Wind chimes are often used as a decorative garden ornament because of their visual appeal, but they can also create beautiful music through the chance movement of the wind. The pitches produced by the wind chimes can be either indistinct or distinct, and depending on the wind conditions, they can create simple melodies or broken chords. A suikinkutsu is a type of ornament and music device commonly found in traditional Japanese gardens. It's essentially an upside-down pot buried in the ground with a small hole at the top that allows water to drizzle in and create a soothing splashing sound. The sound is similar to the ringing of a bell or a Japanese zither called a koto, and is often heard in the context of a traditional Japanese tea ceremony. These devices are typically placed near a small stone basin called a chōzubachi, which is used for washing hands before the tea ceremony. The Borghese Vase is a huge, bell-shaped marble sculpture created in Athens around the second half of the 1st century BC. It was originally intended as a decorative garden piece for the Roman market, but today it can be found in the Louvre Museum in Paris. The vase is made of high-quality Pentelic marble and is considered one of the most important examples of ancient Greek art."}], "output": "  The Waterloo Vase has been used as a garden ornament at Buckingham Palace in London.**"},

Currently, he lives in Brooklyn, New York.The imprest system is a type of financial accounting system used to manage small amounts of money. The most common type of imprest system is the petty cash system. The key characteristic of an imprest system is that a fixed amount of money is set aside, which is then used to pay for small expenses. When the money in the imprest system is depleted, it is replenished from another account, such as a bank account. For example, if the petty cash system is depleted, it can be replenished by cashing a cheque drawn on a bank account. Brian Bethell created the character W. Morgan Petty, who wrote letters expressing common concerns of mid-1980s Britain, such as nuclear war and the common market. These letters were collected into various anthologies. Uterine cancer, also known as womb cancer, is any type of cancer that starts in the tissue of the uterus. There are several types of uterine cancer, but the most common ones are cervical cancer (which starts in the lower part of the uterus) and endometrial cancer (which starts in the inner lining of the uterus). Cervical cancer is the most common type of uterine cancer worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries, while endometrial cancer is the second most common type in women from developed countries.\n\nThere are certain factors that can increase a person's risk of developing uterine cancer, such as being overweight, getting older, and having a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). In the early stages of uterine cancer, there may be no symptoms at all, but some women may experience vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or a feeling of fullness in the pelvis. If uterine cancer is caught early, it can usually be treated with surgery or medicine. However, if the cancer has spread beyond the uterus, more advanced treatments like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of both may be needed. In the past, a crime called petty treason existed in England and other common-law countries. This crime involved a subordinate person betraying or harming (including murdering) their superior. Petty treason was different from the more well-known crime of high treason, which can only be committed against the monarch. In England and Wales, petty treason was abolished in 1828, and in Ireland in 1829. It never existed in Scotland.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. In a common law trial, a group of people called a petit jury (or trial jury, sometimes petty jury) hears the evidence presented by both the person who is suing (called the plaintiff) and the person being sued (called the defendant). After listening to the evidence and instructions from the judge, the jury goes to a private room to discuss and decide the case. The number of people needed to make a decision varies, and in some cases, all the jurors must agree on the verdict, while in others, a simple majority or even a supermajority is enough. If the jury can't reach an agreement, they are said to have a hung jury. The size of the jury can also vary, with 12 people usually being used in criminal cases involving serious crimes, while some countries use 15. However, the common law trial jury is the most typical type of jury system used. Treason is when someone shows no loyalty to their country or government. In the past, in countries with common law, treason was considered a serious crime. It was different from a less serious crime called petty treason, which happened when someone was disloyal to a lower authority figure, like a master to their servant. Petty treason used to be considered a type of murder, but in 1351, it was made a more serious offense. The Kegelhelm, also known as a cone helmet (German: Kegel), is a type of ancient helmet.

Unfortunately, this type of helmet did not survive beyond the 8th century BC.

It's sometimes referred to as Arabic coffee because the name Mırra comes from the Arabic word mur, which means bitter. Mırra is made with common Coffea arabica coffee beans that are roasted twice to give them a bitter taste. Unlike Turkish coffee, which is more like a powder, the coffee grounds for Mırra are still grainy after grinding. To make Mırra, the coffee is brewed in a small pot called a cezve using water and often accompanied by cardamom to give it a more aromatic flavor. The resulting coffee is very bitter and dark, so it's served in small cups without handles, similar to Italian espresso cups.

Channing, Jr. was born on January 7, 1868, and died on April 1, 1961. He was a great football player, member of the Rough Riders, and mining executive. Channing was chosen as one of eleven All-American halfbacks for Princeton University in 1889. When the Spanish-American War started in 1898, Channing joined Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, which made Roosevelt proud to have many Ivy League football players in the group. Channing later went into the mining business and worked for the Whitney family. In the 1920s, he formed a partnership with his friend Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, and they started the Hudson Bay Mining and Smelting Company in Flin Flon, Saskatchewan, Canada. Channing was the company's president until he passed away in 1961. Cornelius Vanderbilt C.V. Whitney, born on February 20, 1899, and passing away on December 13, 1992, was a successful American businessman, film producer, writer, philanthropist, polo player, and government official. In addition, he was the owner of a prominent stable of thoroughbred racehorses. Throughout his life, Whitney excelled in various fields and made significant contributions to society.Equix is a company based in Lexington, Kentucky that was founded in 1984. The company uses advanced digital tools to measure the biometrics and movement of horses in order to identify their athletic potential. Equix mainly works with two-year-old Thoroughbred racehorses at training sales, and uses the data collected from these horses to help breeders and owners select potential racehorses and breeding partners. By analyzing the measurements of these horses, Equix can predict their potential for success in racing. The 2009 World Thoroughbred Rankings were the rankings issued by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) in January 2010. This assessment evaluated Thoroughbred racehorses that competed in flat races during 2009, regardless of where they were trained or raced. The rankings included horses aged three or older and were open to all horses, regardless of their origin. The 2012 World Thoroughbred Rankings were the rankings issued by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) in January 2012. This assessment evaluated Thoroughbred racehorses that competed in flat races during 2011, regardless of where they were trained or raced. The rankings included horses aged three or older and were open to all horses, regardless of their location. Palm Meadows Thoroughbred Training Center is a prestigious American stable and training facility for Thoroughbred racehorses located near Boynton Beach, Florida, just north of the Gulfstream Park racetrack. It is owned by the Stronach Group, a well-known horse racing company. The facility was built by MI Developments (MID) at a cost of $90 million and opened in November 2002. The 304-acre center is considered one of the largest and most modern training centers in the United States for horse racing, providing top-notch care and training for Thoroughbred racehorses. The 2011 World Thoroughbred Rankings were the rankings issued by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) in January 2011. These rankings evaluated Thoroughbred racehorses that competed in flat races during 2011, regardless of where they raced or were trained. The rankings included horses aged three or older and were open to all horses, regardless of their location. In other words, the rankings were a global assessment of the best Thoroughbred racehorses in the world based on their performance in races held in 2011. The 2008 World Thoroughbred Rankings were the rankings issued by the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities (IFHA) in January 2009 to evaluate Thoroughbred racehorses. This was the first time the rankings included horses aged three or older that competed in flat races around the world in 2008. Unlike in previous years, the IFHA published a single list of rankings instead of two separate editions - one for the Northern Hemisphere in January and one for the Southern Hemisphere in August. This change allowed all horses, regardless of where they raced or were trained, to be included in the rankings. Night Raid, a renowned Thoroughbred sire born in England in 1918, played a significant role in the world of horse racing in Australia. He sired two of the leading racehorses in the country, Phar Lap and Nightmarch, who went on to achieve great success on the racetrack. The list of top Thoroughbred racehorses includes the names of horses that have never lost a race, as well as others that have performed exceptionally well in specific categories. However, it's important to remember that even the best horses can experience unexpected defeats due to various factors such as injury, illness, or differences in racing tactics. For example, in North America and Australia, where handicaps are common, the weight carried by a horse can significantly affect its performance, leading to unexpected losses even for the best horses."}], "output": "  Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney formed a partnership with Roscoe H.

He was one of the first designers to introduce Scandinavian design to the United States, which became an exemplar of the style. Risom was born on May 8, 1916, and passed away on December 9, 2016, leaving behind a legacy of timeless and elegant designs. Scandinavian design is a design movement that started in the 1950s in the five Nordic countries of Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark. Although the term Scandinavia only refers to the three kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, people often use it to refer to all five countries. This design style is known for being simple, minimalist, and functional. It emerged as a response to the ornate and elaborate designs that were popular at the time, and it has since become a symbol of modern, clean, and efficient design.In 2003, Charles Lim Chee Pang, the founder of Peliontech, introduced a new term called Workflow Resource Planning (WRP) to describe a new type of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. Unlike conventional ERP software, which relies on a data entry and processing model, WRP software integrates workflow functionality into its core design. This was a significant innovation, as it allowed for more efficient and streamlined business processes. Prior to this, Lotus Notes was a pioneer in workflow systems, but it fell out of favor in the early 2000s. Charles Lim drew inspiration from Lotus Notes and combined its workflow ideas with ERP systems to create Radix WRP, a new class of ERP software that combines workflow manageability with traditional ERP features. In the NTFS file system, a symbolic link (symlink) is a special object that points to another object. The object being pointed to is called the target. Symlinks are designed to be invisible to users, so they appear like regular files or directories. You can treat them the same way you would any other file or directory. In fact, you can even create symbolic links to directories or volumes (called junction points or mount points) with NTFS 3.0 and later versions. However, the feature wasn't available to user-mode applications until NTFS 3.1, which was introduced with Windows XP. But you could make it work in user mode by using third-party filter drivers like Masatoshi Kimura's open-source code_1 driver. Starting with Windows Vista, the functionality is available to user-mode applications by default through the ntfs.sys file. Jens Ritter Instruments is a company that makes high-quality electric stringed instruments. It was started by Jens Ritter in the mid-1990s, and was originally called Ritter Bass Guitars. In 2010, Jens expanded his line to include guitars, and the company has been producing around 50 to 60 handmade instruments each year in its workshop in the small German town of Deidesheim. Many well-known bassists, including Phil Lesh, Josh Dunham, and Doug Wimbish, play Ritter Basses, which are known for their innovative designs and craftsmanship. Jens Ritter Instruments are also known for their unique appearance and limited availability, and they also make and sell strings and other accessories. Bio-inspired robotics is a relatively new field that involves studying nature to create more efficient and effective engineering systems. It's about taking cues from biological systems and applying them to robot design. Bio-inspired design is different from biomimicry, which is about copying nature directly. Instead, bio-inspired design involves learning from nature and simplifying or enhancing the mechanisms found in biological systems to solve engineering problems.\n\nBio-inspired robotics focuses on studying biological systems like sensors, actuators, and materials. Robots often have locomotion systems, which are inspired by different modes of animal locomotion, such as walking, crawling, or flying. By learning from nature, bio-inspired roboticists can create robots that are more efficient and effective than those designed using traditional methods.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore different modes of animal locomotion and some examples of bio-inspired robots that mimic these abilities. By understanding how nature solves problems, we can create more advanced and efficient robots that can help us in various fields, such as search and rescue, healthcare, and manufacturing. In the United States, trademark law has a rule called the functionality doctrine that prevents companies from protecting specific features of their products through trademarks. This rule has two parts: utilitarian functionality and aesthetic functionality. The reason for this doctrine is that if new companies couldn't make products with features that consumers want, the market wouldn't be fair and competitive. Utilitarian functionality means that if a product feature is useful, trademark law can't protect it. Instead, patent law protects useful inventions, like machines and processes. Patented designs are assumed to be functional until proven otherwise. Aesthetic functionality means that if a product feature is included to make it look more appealing, trademark law can't protect it either. Instead, creative and original works of authorship are protected by copyright law. Jacqueline Jackie Winsor is a Canadian-American sculptor born in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1941. In the early 1970s, Winsor developed her unique style as a response to the work of minimal artists. Her art is often referred to as post-minimal, anti-form, and process art. Winsor's sculptures from this period blend elements of Minimalism and feminism, while departing from the industrial materials and techniques associated with Minimalism. Instead, she uses hand-crafted, organic materials like wood and hemp to create works that prioritize simplicity and geometric form. Extensibility is a fundamental principle in software engineering and systems design, which means that the system is designed to accommodate future growth and changes. In other words, the system is built with the flexibility to add new features or modify existing ones without significantly affecting its internal structure or data flow. This allows developers to expand or modify the system's capabilities over time to meet the evolving needs of users.\n\nThere are different ways to achieve extensibility, such as adding new functionality or modifying existing functionality. The key idea is to make it easy to change the system without affecting its core operations. For example, instead of recompiling the original source code, developers can insert user-created program routines or define new data types and formatting markup tags.\n\nExtensibility is essential in software development because software systems are meant to be long-lived and constantly evolving. As users demand new features and functionalities, extensibility enables developers to easily modify or add to the system's capabilities, making it more efficient and cost-effective. In summary, extensibility is a crucial aspect of software engineering that helps developers create systems that can adapt to changing user needs over time. In HTML, attributes are special modifiers that can be added to certain elements to change their behavior or add new functionality. Think of attributes like superpowers for your HTML elements! They can make an element do something it couldn't do otherwise, or enhance its default behavior. To add an attribute to an HTML element, you simply include it inside the element's start tag, like a special power-up."}], "output": "  Design.**"},

It serves as the home ground of Scunthorpe United, a professional football club. The 1994 FA Women's Cup Final was the 24th edition of the FA Women's Cup, the most prestigious cup competition for women's football teams in England. The final match was played at Glanford Park in Scunthorpe on April 24, 1994, between Doncaster Belles and Knowsley United Women. This was Knowsley United's first appearance in the final, after losing the previous season's FA Women's Premier League Cup final at Wembley. Doncaster Belles, on the other hand, had made it to their 11th final in 12 seasons and had won the trophy five times in the past.Samantha Sammy Howarth, born Samantha Hayward on February 1, 1971, is an English international soccer player. She played in the top division of the FA Women's Premier League with three different teams: Liverpool, Doncaster Belles, and Tranmere Rovers. As of 2013, she currently plays for Southampton Women's Football Club. The 2016 FA Women's Cup Final was the 46th annual final of the FA Women's Cup, the most prestigious cup competition for women's football teams in England. This year's showpiece event was the 23rd to be organized directly by the Football Association (FA) and was called the SSE Women's FA Cup Final due to sponsorship reasons. On May 14, 2016, the final match took place at Wembley Stadium in London, which was the second time the FA Women's Cup Final had been held at this iconic stadium. The contest between Arsenal Ladies and Chelsea Ladies was an exciting and closely contested match. The 2017 FA Women's Cup Final was a big event in English women's football. It was the 47th time the competition had been held, and it was the 24th time the final was being organized directly by the Football Association (FA). The event was sponsored by SSE, so it was called the SSE Women's FA Cup Final. The final match was between Birmingham City Ladies and Manchester City Ladies on May 13, 2017, at Wembley Stadium in London. This was the third time the Women's Cup Final had been held at Wembley, and it attracted a record number of people (35,271) to watch the game. Doncaster Rovers Belles Ladies Football Club, previously known as Doncaster Belles, is a women's football club in England that plays in the top tier of women's football, known as FA WSL 1. The club is based at the Keepmoat Stadium in Doncaster, a town in South Yorkshire. The 2015 FA Women's Cup Final was the 45th edition of the tournament, which is the most important cup competition for women's football teams in England. This year's final was special because it was the 22nd time the event was held directly under the auspices of the Football Association (FA), and it was sponsored by SSE. On August 1, 2015, the final match was played at Wembley Stadium in London between Chelsea Ladies and Notts County Ladies. Chelsea had been to the final before, in 2012, but lost. For Notts County, it was their first ever final appearance. The 2002 FA Women's Cup Final was a big event in English women's football history.

When light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometers enters our eyes, we see blue. Blues with a higher frequency (shorter wavelength) appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency (longer wavelength) gradually appear more green. Pure blue, with a wavelength of 470 nanometers, is right in the middle. In painting and traditional color theory, blue is one of the three main colors of pigments, along with red and yellow. When you mix red and blue together, you get violet, and mixing blue and yellow creates green. Blue is also a primary color in the RGB color model used to make all the colors on a TV or computer screen. Innocent Records was created by EMI to cater to the pop side of their Virgin Records label. After the success of the Spice Girls, Virgin decided to focus more on pop music and hired Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records (known for helping Take That become a successful act) to launch his own label within Virgin. Goldsmith signed artists such as Billie Piper and Martine McCutcheon, as well as some dance acts like Todd Terry. The label did well in the mid-2000s with acts like Atomic Kitten and Blue selling Platinum records.The ProPhoto RGB color space, also called ROMM RGB (Reference Output Medium Metric), is a special type of RGB color space developed by Kodak. It's designed for use with photographic output, and it has a much larger color gamut than other RGB color spaces. In fact, it covers over 90% of all possible colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of real-world colors that have been documented. The ProPhoto RGB color space also has special primaries that help reduce hue rotations when converting colors to non-linear tone scales. However, one downside is that it can't represent around 13% of colors that don't exist or are invisible. The YCoCg color model is a way of creating a color space by transforming an associated RGB color space into three values: a luma value (denoted as Y), and two chroma values called chrominance green (Cg) and chrominance orange (Co). This color model is commonly used in video and image compression systems like H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, HEVC, JPEG XR, and Dirac because it's easy to compute, has good compression properties, and can be easily converted to and from RGB with fewer bits than other color models. A color space is a way of organizing colors in a specific way. When combined with physical device profiling, it allows for accurate representations of colors in both analog and digital form. A color space can be set up in different ways, such as using specific colors assigned to physical swatches (like the Pantone collection) or using mathematical structures (like NCS System, Adobe RGB, or sRGB).\n\nA color model is a way of describing how colors can be represented using numbers (like triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK). However, a color model without a mapping function to an actual color space is more like a theoretical color system that doesn't have a universal understanding.\n\nWhen a color model is combined with a reference color space, it creates a specific area within that space called a gamut. For a particular color model, this defines the range of colors that can be accurately represented. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces that are based on the same RGB color model.\n\nWhen defining a color space, the standard reference is usually one of the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were created to include all the colors that most people can see. These color spaces help ensure that colors are accurately represented and understood across different devices and mediums. HCL (Hue, Color, Luminance) is designed to combine the benefits of both cylindrical translations of the RGB color space, such as HSL and HSV, and the L*a*b* color space. While HSL and HSV are perceptually uniform translations of the RGB color space, they don't accurately represent how humans perceive color. On the other hand, L*a*b* color space corresponds to the three channels of human perception, but has poor hue constancy, particularly in the blue range. By combining these different approaches, HCL aims to provide a more accurate and versatile color representation. RGBA stands for red, green, blue, and alpha. While it's often referred to as a color space, it's actually just an extension of the RGB color model. The RGB colors are the same as usual, but the RGBA addition includes an extra alpha channel that allows for alpha compositing. This alpha channel is like a transparency value, which helps blend the color with other images or backgrounds. The inventors of the RGBA format, Ed Catmull and Alvy Smith, created it between 1971 and 1972. They named the alpha channel after the Greek letter alpha used in a mathematical formula for smooth transitions between colors.   Brown is a unique color that can be created in different ways depending on the context. In the CMYK color model used in printing or painting, brown is made by combining red, black, and yellow, or red, yellow, and blue. On the other hand, when projecting colors onto television screens and computer monitors, brown is made by combining red and green in specific proportions. Brown is a common color found in nature, appearing in various forms such as wood, soil, human hair color, eye color, and skin pigmentation. It is often associated with dark wood or rich soil, and although it is not the most favorite color among the public, it is often linked to simplicity, the rustic, and poverty. The RGB color model is a way of creating colors by combining different amounts of red, green, and blue light. This model works by adding these colors together in different ways to create a wide range of hues. The name RGB comes from the initials of the three primary colors used in the model: red, green, and blue. An RGB color space is a type of color space that uses the RGB color model. In simple terms, an RGB color space is defined by the combination of three colors - red, green, and blue - and how they interact with each other. The exact combination of these colors and how they interact is unique to each RGB color space, and can produce a wide range of other colors. To fully define an RGB color space, you also need to specify the color of white and a curve that adjusts the brightness of the colors. As of 2007, the most commonly used RGB color space is called sRGB."}], "output": "  The act for Innocent Records that achieved Platinum sales and shares its name with a primary color in the RGB color model is Blue."},

Dick and Ray Nelson, and published in 1967. It's an alien invasion story, similar to Dick's earlier novel The Game-Players of Titan. In an interview, Dick revealed that The Ganymede Takeover was originally intended to be a sequel to his alternate history novel The Man in the High Castle, but with a twist - instead of the Japanese occupying the United States, it would have been the planet Ganymede. The Man in the High Castle is a novel by Philip K. Dick, published in 1962, that explores an alternative history of the world. In this alternative timeline, the Axis Powers (primarily Japan and Germany) won World War II and now rule over the United States. The novel focuses on the political intrigue between these powers and the daily life of people living under their rule. The Man in the High Castle won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1963 and was later adapted into a TV series starting in 2015.Nobuteru Yūki is a Japanese manga artist, illustrator, and animator. He was born in Tokyo on December 24, 1962. Yūki started his career as a doujinshi artist under the pen names The Man in the High Castle (高い城の男, Takai Shiro no Otoko) and Ubik (ユービック, Yūbikku). These names are references to the works of American science fiction author Philip K. Dick. Yūki has designed characters for various manga, anime, and video games, and has collaborated with director Kazuki Akane on several projects, including their most famous work, The Vision of Escaflowne. The Man in the High Castle is a popular Amazon Prime Video series produced by Amazon Studios, Scott Free Productions, Headline Pictures, Electric Shepherd Productions, and Big Light Productions. The show is based on a 1962 novel by science fiction author Philip K. Dick and takes place in an alternate version of 1962 where the Axis powers (Germany and Japan) won World War II. In this alternate history, the United States is divided into two territories: the Greater Nazi Reich and the Japanese Pacific States. The series follows several characters whose lives become intertwined after they discover a set of propaganda films that show a very different version of history from their own. Philip K. Dick's 1960 science fiction novel, Vulcan's Hammer, was originally published as part of an Ace Double series. This novel is significant because it marks the end of Dick's 1950s-style pulp science fiction writing era, which is less well-known compared to his later work like the Hugo Award-winning The Man in the High Castle, which was published the following year. Tzi Ma, born on June 10, 1962, is a talented Hong Kong-American actor who has appeared in many American movies and TV shows.

It focused on different music styles such as punk rock, power pop, garage rock, beat music, rock music, and psychedelic music. The time period of the music featured in the magazine ranged from the 1960s to the late 1990s. The magazine was published in English at irregular intervals. The editor, Hans-Jürgen Klitsch, also wrote two books about the German music scene in the 1960s: Shakin' All Over - Die Beatmusik in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland 1963-1967 (High Castle, 2000; revised 2001) and Otto & die Beatlejungs - Die Beatszene der 60er Jahre zwischen Oldenburg, Emden und Wilhelmshaven (Isensee, 2008). Samuel R. Delany's collection of stories, Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories, was published by Vintage Books in 2003. This book is similar to other collections of stories by James Joyce, Sherwood Anderson, and Willa Cather, as it is thematically arranged and features a dedication to Delany's immediate family. The book includes ten science fiction tales and five fantasies, all written in chronological order. The stories in the collection were first published in an earlier collection called Driftglass in 1971, and the dedication and epigraphs are similar between the two books. Eric Ellis Overmyer is an American writer and producer, born on September 25, 1951.

The group, called Brigade 2506, was made up of exiles who had fled Cuba after Fidel Castro took power. They were trained and funded by the CIA and were part of a larger organization called the Democratic Revolutionary Front (DRF). The invasion aimed to overthrow Castro's increasingly communist government. The invading force launched from Guatemala and Nicaragua, but they were defeated by the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces, led by Castro himself, within just three days.   Francisco José Hernández, also known as Pepe, was born in Havana, Cuba on September 1, 1936. He is a Cuban exile from the 1960s who is against the government of Cuba, specifically the Castro regime.

Despite the hardships he faced, Lunin remained defiant towards the autocratic Russian government and was eventually imprisoned again for writing in opposition to the government. He spent the rest of his life in a cell, passing away on December 3, 1845. Despite the harsh conditions of his imprisonment, Lunin remained optimistic and maintained his political beliefs until the end of his life.

The Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty, also known as the Treaty of Taipei, was signed in Taipei, Taiwan on April 28, 1952, and went into effect on August 5 of the same year. This treaty marked the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) between Japan and the Republic of China (ROC). The reason for this treaty was that neither the ROC nor the People's Republic of China (PRC) was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951, due to disagreements among other countries about which government was the legitimate government of China. The United States pressed Japan to sign a separate peace treaty with the ROC to bring the war between the two countries to an end. Although the ROC was not invited to the San Francisco Peace Conference in 1951 due to the resumption of the Chinese Civil War after 1945, this treaty is similar to the San Francisco Treaty in many ways. In particular, the ROC waived its right to seek compensation from Japan regarding Article 14(a)1 of the San Francisco Treaty. In 1138, during a time of conflict known as The Anarchy, a battle took place near Clitheroe, Lancashire, between Scottish knights and men at arms and their English counterparts.

The Scottish forces harassed the local towns of Furness and Craven before encountering an English army led by unknown knights and men-at-arms. A fierce battle ensued, and the English forces were defeated.

It's the third film in the Whispering Corridors series, which is set in girls' high schools, but each movie in the series is an independent story and not connected to the others. The only connection is that one song appears in one scene, which plays a significant role in the movie Voice. Voice (also known as Whispering Corridors 4: Voice and Voice Letter) is a South Korean horror movie released in 2005. It's the fourth installment of the Whispering Corridors film series. This film marked the debut of three young actresses and the director, Choi Ik-Hwan, who had previously worked as an assistant director on the first film in the series.Rimstone, also called gours, is a type of cave formation that forms like a stone dam. It's made up of calcite and other minerals that build up in cave pools. As the minerals accumulate, they create a series of stone steps or stairs inside the cave. Sometimes, the rimstone extends upwards or downwards from the original formation, creating a unique staircase-like structure. Additionally, small, microscopic gours may form on the horizontal surfaces of the rimstone. These formations can create beautiful terraces that stretch for hundreds of feet, with some single basins reaching lengths of up to 200 feet, as seen in Tham Xe Biang Fai in Laos. A voice type is a particular type of singing voice that has certain unique qualities or characteristics, such as how high or low the voice can go, how full or light it is, and how it sounds. These qualities are determined through a process called voice classification, which evaluates the voice and assigns it to a specific type. Voice classification is commonly used in classical music, particularly in opera, to help identify suitable roles for singers based on their voice type. There are several different systems used for voice classification, including the German Fach system and the choral music system, but no single system is widely accepted or used.

It was located near the park offices on the northern edge of Cache Lake and was a popular spot for visitors. However, the Ontario government decided to return the park to its natural state, so it purchased the Inn in 1957 and tore it down. Today, only the remains of the concrete stairs and platform that used to be part of the CNR line (the Canadian National Railway) can still be seen, as the last train left in 1959. The list of ancient spiral stairs includes a selection of Greco-Roman spiral stairs built during classical antiquity. Spiral stairs are a type of stairway that, because of their twisting shape, were introduced to architecture relatively late. Although the oldest example dates back to the 5th century BC, it wasn't until the famous design of Trajan's Column that spiral stairs became a permanent fixture in Roman architecture. Callington Mill is a historic tower mill located in Oatlands, Tasmania, built in 1837 by John Vincent. After undergoing restoration, the mill is now fully operational and is the only one of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere that is still working.

The Exchange Ilford is the primary shopping mall located in the heart of Ilford, London. It was previously owned by The Mall Fund, but has now been sold and reverted to its original name, The Exchange Mall. The mall spans across three levels of retail space, but its architectural design creates a separation between the lower floor's retail areas, forcing customers to travel between the two sections via the middle level. Additionally, there is an upper level with food court facilities that can be accessed from the middle level. Moving between the levels is easy with the help of lifts, stairs, and escalators within the mall.

The film features contributions from several notable figures, including writers Alan Moore and Iain Sinclair, the torch singer Claudia Barton, and the musician Jem Finer. The Abbey Church of Waltham Holy Cross and St Lawrence is the main church in the town of Waltham Abbey, Essex, England. It has been a place of worship since the 7th century. The current building was mainly constructed in the early 12th century and features Norman architecture. To the east of the existing church, there are remains of a large expansion project that was started in 1177, after the abbey was re-founded. In the Middle Ages, Waltham Abbey was one of the largest and most important religious buildings in England, attracting many pilgrims. Unfortunately, it was closed in 1540 during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but it continues to be an active parish church for the town today.Tostig Godwinson was an important leader in England during the 11th century. He was an Earl of Northumbria and the brother of King Harold Godwinson. Unfortunately, Tostig had a difficult relationship with his brother and was eventually exiled from England. After being exiled, Tostig supported a foreign king named Harald Hardrada who was trying to take over England. Tostig fought alongside Harald at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, but they were both defeated and killed. Edith the Fair, also known as Edyth the Gentle Swan (Old English: Ealdgȳð Swann hnesce), was the first wife of King Harold Godwinson. The nickname Swanneck or Swan-Neck comes from a folk etymology that misinterpreted her name in Old English as swann hnecca, which actually means Gentle Swan. She is sometimes confused with Ealdgyth, the daughter of Earl Ælfgar of Mercia, who was also queen during Harold's reign. Several fictional accounts have been written about Harold Godwinson's brief rule as king of England. These include a play called Harold by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, published in 1876, and a novel called Last of the Saxon Kings by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, published in 1848. In addition, Rudyard Kipling wrote a short story called The Way of the King which appears in his 1910 collection Rewards and Fairies. In this story, an elderly King Harold meets King Henry I and dies in the arms of a Saxon knight. The Last English King, a historical novel written by Julian Rathbone in 1997, tells the story of Walt Edwinson, a housecarl who served under Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England. The novel takes place around the time of the Battle of Hastings, which occurred in 1066. The story begins with Walt returning home to Iwerne in Dorset four years after the battle, where he had fled following the defeat of the Anglo-Saxons. During his journey, Walt recounts his adventures traveling from Constantinople to Nicomedia and Nicaea, and then to Side. At the same time, he reflects on his experiences before the battle, such as accompanying Harold on a mission to William of Normandy's territory in Dinan. Leofwine Godwinson was born around 1035 and was the younger brother of King Harold Godwinson. Their father was Earl Godwin, who was their mother's husband. This means that Leofwine was a nephew of King Harold, being the fifth of Earl Godwin's sons. On September 25, 1066, a big battle called the Battle of Stamford Bridge took place in a village in Yorkshire, England. The English king, King Harold Godwinson, led his army against a group of Norwegian invaders led by King Harald Hardrada and King Harold's own brother, Tostig Godwinson. The battle was fierce, and most of the Norwegians were killed. Although King Harold won the battle, his army was soon defeated by the Normans at Hastings just a few weeks later. This battle is often seen as the end of the Viking Age, but there were still many more Scandinavian attacks on Britain and Ireland in the following years, such as those led by King Sweyn Estrithson of Denmark in 1069-1070 and King Magnus Barefoot of Norway in 1098 and 1102-1103. Gytha Thorkelsdóttir (also known as Githa) was a Danish noblewoman who lived from 997 to around 1069. She was the mother of King Harold Godwinson and Queen Edith of Wessex, who was married to King Edward the Confessor of England. Godwin of Wessex, also known as Godƿin (born in 1001 and died on April 10, 1053), was a very powerful man in England during the time of the Danish king Cnut the Great and his successors. In fact, Cnut made Godwin the very first Earl of Wessex, a position of great power and influence. Godwin was the father of King Harold Godwinson and the husband of Edith of Wessex, who was also the wife of King Edward the Confessor."}], "output": "  The English king Harold Godwinson is buried in Waltham Abbey, Essex, England. **"},

She turned professional in 1998 and has had a successful career, winning the 2010 French Open singles title, becoming the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam event in singles. This was a significant achievement, as she was able to defeat other top players to win the title. She also reached the finals of the French Open in 2011, but lost to another player. Schiavone's career high ranking is world No. 4, which she achieved on January 31, 2011. What makes Schiavone stand out is that she is a one-handed backhand player, which is a rare sight on the women's tennis tour. Olga Vasilyevna Morozova was born on February 22, 1949, and is a former Soviet tennis player. She was a highly skilled player who reached the finals of two major tennis tournaments: the French Open in 1974 and the Wimbledon Championships in the same year. Morozova lost in both finals, but her impressive performance earned her a place in the history of Soviet tennis.The Williams sisters, Venus and Serena, are two professional American tennis players who were coached by their parents from a young age. They have a strong rivalry on the court, having played each other in nine Grand Slam singles finals between 2001 and 2017. In fact, they became the first two players, male or female, to play in four consecutive Grand Slam singles finals from 2002 to 2003. Serena famously won all four of these finals to complete what is known as a Serena Slam. Overall, between 2000 and 2016, the sisters collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles, with Venus winning five and Serena winning seven. In 2001, they became the fifth pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam. At the time, Venus and Serena were just 20 and 19 years old, respectively. They have since gone on to win two more Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics. The sisters also won four consecutive Grand Slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon to 2010 Roland Garros, which propelled them to become the co-number one doubles players on June 7, 2010. Two weeks later, Serena held the number one singles ranking, while Venus was right behind her at number two in singles. Their most recent Grand Slam doubles titles came at the 2012 Wimbledon and 2016 Wimbledon events. Despite their success on the court, the sisters remain close and often support each other, even after one of them has been eliminated from a tournament. The 1968 US Open (formerly known as the U.S. National Championships) was a tennis tournament held at the West Side Tennis Club in New York, USA, from August 29 to September 8. This was the 88th edition of the tournament and the fourth Grand Slam event of the year. It was the first US Open held in the Open Era of tennis, which meant that for the first time, prize money was awarded. The tournament offered $100,000 in prize money, with Arthur Ashe and Virginia Wade winning the singles titles. Ashe, who was still an amateur, did not receive the $14,000 first-prize money, which went to runner-up Tom Okker instead. Meanwhile, Wade earned $6,000 for her victory. Frank Parker, aged 52, made history by losing to Ashe in the second round, still holding the record for the oldest person to compete in a Grand Slam singles tournament. The 2012 US Open Men's Singles final was the most important tennis match of the year. Andy Murray faced off against defending champion Novak Djokovic in a thrilling five-set match that lasted four hours and 54 minutes. Murray emerged victorious, defeating Djokovic 7-6, 7-5, 2-6, 3-6, 6-2. This victory was significant for Murray, as he became the first British man to win a Grand Slam singles title since Fred Perry in 1936, and the first British man in the Open Era to do so. The match was also notable because it was Murray's 100th win at a Grand Slam tournament. The competition between Murray and Djokovic has been intense, making this match a memorable moment in their rivalry. Li Na (born February 26, 1982) is a former professional tennis player from China who reached the top of her sport. She became the best tennis player in the world for a time, reaching number two in the rankings. Li won seven singles titles on the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) tour and two Grand Slam singles titles at the French Open and Australian Open.

In 1961, she was seeded number one for the Wimbledon Ladies Singles Championship, making her the only South African player (man or woman) to be seeded first in a Grand Slam singles event. She also won the German Championships in 1960, 1961, and 1962, and was the runner-up at the 1959 Italian Championships, where she defeated Bueno in a semifinal before losing to Christine Truman in the final.

The 2017 Australian Open Men's Singles final was the most important tennis match of the year, and it was between two of the best players in the world: Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. They were ranked 17th and 9th, respectively, and they had played each other in eight previous Grand Slam finals. This was their first meeting in a Grand Slam final since 2011, and it was a rematch of the 2009 Australian Open final, which Nadal won. Federer won the match in five sets, which was a big comeback for him since he had lost to Nadal in their previous six meetings in Grand Slam events. This victory not only gave Federer his 18th Grand Slam title, but it also marked the first time he had beaten Nadal in a Grand Slam match outside of Wimbledon. Federer broke his own record for the most Grand Slam titles won by a man, after previously breaking the record of 14 held by Pete Sampras."}], "output": "  Francesca Schiavone and Olga Morozova have both been finalists in the French Open."},

He was a politician and served as mayor of several cities in Germany, including Essen, Dortmund, and Düsseldorf. His grandson, Captain Ernst Lindemann, was a naval officer and commanded the battleship Bismarck. Bismarck was the first of two battleships, called Bismarck-class, built for Germany's Navy (Kriegsmarine) during World War II. Named after Otto von Bismarck, the leader who united Germany in 1871, the ship was built at the Hamburg shipyard Blohm & Voss and launched in February 1939. It took about 14 months to complete the construction and Bismarck was commissioned into the German fleet in August 1940. These two battleships were the largest built by Germany and two of the largest built by any European country.Hans-Jürgen Hansjürgen Rudolf Reinicke was a German naval officer who served as the commander of the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen in the Nazi German Kriegsmarine during World War II.

During World War II, Germany's Kriegsmarine used a ship called Widder (pronounced Vidder) as a merchant raider. This ship was also known as Hilfskreuzer (auxiliary cruiser) 3. The German navy gave Widder the designation Schiff 21, while the Royal Navy called her Raider D. The name Widder represents the Aries constellation in German, which is fitting because the ship's captain, Kapitän zur See Helmuth von Ruckteschell, had a horoscope sign of Aries. Z43 was a German destroyer called a Type 1936B. It was built in Bremen and launched on September 22, 1943. It was commissioned on March 24, 1944, and served with the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) during World War II. Z43 was part of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla and operated in the Baltic Sea under the command of two different captains: Kapitän zur See Wenniger and Fregattenkapitän Lampe. The ship primarily escorted other ships, including the heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer, and took part in a minelaying operation in December 1944, where two of its sister ships, Z35 and Z36, were sunk. Z43 was badly damaged by a mine on April 10, 1945, and was eventually scuttled on May 3 of that year. Ernst Kals was a naval officer in the Kriegsmarine during World War II. He served as the captain of the Type IXC U-boat U-130 on five missions, and he is credited with sinking 20 ships that together totaled 145,656 tons of Allied cargo. For his bravery and leadership, Kals was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, a prestigious German military honor. The 21st U-boat Flotilla (21. Unterseebootsflottille) was a unit of the Nazi German Navy (Kriegsmarine) during World War II. It was formed in 1935 as a training unit, known as a School Unit, based in Kiel under the command of Captain Kurt Slevogt (Chief of the Training Unit). Otto Ernst Lindemann was a German naval captain, or Kapitän zur See, who served as the only commander of the battleship Bismarck during its eight months in World War II. This was from March 1941 until the ship was sunk in May of the same year. Wolf Junge was a German naval officer during World War II. In August 1943, he was appointed as the executive officer of the battleship Tirpitz under Captain Hans Meyer. When Meyer was injured in an air attack on Tirpitz on April 3, 1944, Junge temporarily took control of the ship. Later that month, Junge was officially confirmed in his new role. However, he was not well-liked by the ship's crew because they thought he lacked experience operating warships at sea. In November 1944, Junge handed over command of Tirpitz to Captain Robert Weber. Hans Jenisch was a German naval officer who served in both the Nazi Germany Kriegsmarine and the West Germany Bundesmarine during World War II. As a Kapitänleutnant in the Kriegsmarine, he commanded a Type VIIA U-boat called U-32 and sank 17 ships on 7 patrols, amounting to a total of 75,000 gross register tons (GRT) of Allied shipping. This made him the 26th highest scoring U-boat ace of World War II."}], "output": "  The answer to your question is: Bismarck.**"},

Originally, it was a variant of the popular Jeep Wagoneer, but over time it evolved into a compact SUV and eventually became a crossover SUV. The name Cherokee comes from the Native American tribe of the same name. The Jeep Cherokee has been a successful line for the company, with its most popular model, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, being spun off as a separate line. The Jeep Wagoneer was the first luxury 4x4 vehicle ever made, sold and produced by Jeep from 1963 to 1991. This sport utility vehicle (SUV) was around long before the term SUV was invented, and it saw only minor changes to its mechanical components during its impressive 28-year production run, which is the third longest in US automotive history.Richard A. Teague, born in Los Angeles, California on December 26, 1923, was an important American industrial designer in the North American automotive industry. He worked at several major car companies, including General Motors, Packard, and Chrysler, before becoming Vice President of Design at American Motors Corporation (AMC). Teague designed several famous cars during his career, such as the AMC Pacer, Gremlin, and Hornet, as well as the Jeep Cherokee XJ and other models for Chrysler after American Motors was bought out. Some of his other notable designs include the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Neon. The Jeep Cherokee SJ series is a full-size SUV that was produced from 1974 to 1983 by Jeep. It was based on a design created by Brooks Stevens in 1963, called the Wagoneer. The Jeep Liberty (also known as the Jeep Cherokee outside of North America) is a compact SUV that was produced by Jeep. Introduced in 2008 as a replacement for the first-generation Liberty, the second-generation model was assembled at plants in the United States, Egypt, and Venezuela. According to Jeep's estimates, about 70% of Liberty buyers were new to the brand. The second-generation Liberty stopped production in 2012, and the name was later retired. However, the model is still available for sale in Venezuela as of 2016, pending a replacement by the KL model Cherokee. The Jeep Cherokee (KL) is a mid-size crossover SUV produced by Jeep. It was introduced in 2013 at the New York International Auto Show and went on sale in November of that year.

The Cherokee is made at the Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois. The Jeep Grand Cherokee (WK2) is a luxury SUV that was introduced in 2010 for the 2011 model year. It was first shown at the New York Auto Show in 2009. This fourth-generation Grand Cherokee has a classic Jeep design with a modern and sleek body.

Instead of a traditional body-on-frame design, the XJ had a lightweight, unibody structure. When it was first introduced, Jeep called these vehicles Sportwagons. They were important because they helped create the modern sport utility vehicle (SUV) as we know it today, even though the term SUV wasn't used back then.

Within these branches, there are various sub-sects. A large number of Shia Muslims live in several Arab countries, including Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the UAE, and Qatar. In some of these countries, Shia Muslims make up the majority or a significant portion of the population. For example, in Iraq and Bahrain, Shia Muslims are the majority, and in Yemen, approximately half of the population is Shia. In Lebanon, about half of the Muslim population is Shia. There are also many Shia Muslims living in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where they make up a significant portion of the population in the eastern province. However, official government statistics claim that only 20-40% of the Muslim population in these countries are Shia, but some estimates suggest that the actual number is much higher, around 45% or even a majority.\n\nDespite their significant numbers, Shia Muslims have faced discrimination and poor treatment throughout history in many Arab countries. In recent times, they have faced genocide and persecution under the pan-Arabist regime of Saddam Hussein. Due to historical and political reasons, the Shia have been marginalized and face significant challenges in much of the Arab world. This article explores the history of Shia Islam in the Arab world and their current situation in the Arabic-speaking world. Statistical inference is the process of making educated guesses about a larger group of people or things (called a population) based on a smaller group of people or things (called a sample) that you have actually observed. This involves using statistical methods to analyze the sample data and make assumptions about the properties of the larger population. For example, you might use statistical inference to test hypotheses about the population or to estimate certain characteristics of the population. The key idea is that the sample you are studying is just a small part of a much larger whole, and you want to use the sample data to make informed guesses about the larger population.

In Irish mythology, a banshee is a female spirit that signals the death of a family member by crying or wailing. The word banshee comes from the Old Irish bean sí, which means woman of the fairy mound or fairy woman. These spirits are believed to haunt specific mounds or tumuli, known as síde in Old Irish, which are found throughout the Irish countryside.In various cultures across the Caucasus region, there is a legendary figure known as Al Basty or Al Kardai, which translates to Guilt in Turkish.

In the 15th episode of The Simpsons' 7th season, titled Bart the Fink, Bart accidentally exposes Krusty the Clown as a huge tax cheat. Krusty becomes so depressed that he pretends to commit suicide to start over as a sailor.

It's also the last episode to feature a grounding until season 27's 'The Marge-ian Chronicles' six years later (also written by Brian Kelley).

As of 2016, these resorts have a total of 12,536 hotel rooms between them. MGM Grand, in particular, is notable for being the largest hotel in the world at one point, with an impressive 5,044 rooms. Downtown Las Vegas, also called DTLV, is the main business area and historic heart of Las Vegas, Nevada. It was the original townsite and was where gambling first started in Las Vegas before the Strip became popular. Today, downtown still has gaming and other entertainment options, as well as a mix of hotels, businesses, cultural attractions, historical buildings, and government offices. Downtown Las Vegas is located in the middle of the Las Vegas Valley, just north of the Las Vegas Strip, near Fremont Street and the Fremont Street Experience. The city defines the area as bordered by Interstate 15 on the west, Washington Avenue on the north, Maryland Parkway on the east, and Sahara Avenue on the south.

It's the fourth film in a series of live-action musicals featuring the Muppets, with Michael Caine playing the role of Ebenezer Scrooge. Although it has a fun and upbeat tone, the movie stays true to the original story by Dickens. The film was produced and directed by Brian Henson for Jim Henson Productions and was released by Walt Disney Pictures. Bedknobs and Broomsticks is a 1971 musical fantasy movie produced by Walt Disney Productions and released in North America on December 13, 1971. The film is based on two books by English author Mary Norton: The Magic Bedknob; or, How to Become a Witch in Ten Easy Lessons, published in 1943, and Bonfires and Broomsticks, published in 1945. The movie combines live-action and animation and stars Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson.The Sword in the Stone is a 1963 American animated musical fantasy comedy film produced by Walt Disney and released through Buena Vista Distribution. This was the 18th Disney animated feature film to be made, and it was released just before Walt Disney's death. The movie's songs were written and composed by the Sherman Brothers, who also worked on other famous Disney films, such as Mary Poppins (1964), The Jungle Book (1967), The Aristocats (1970), and Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). Dave Goelz created and played Gonzo in the 1970 special The Great Santa Claus Switch, where he first appeared as a Cigar Box Frackle. Initially, Gonzo was a minor character in The Muppet Show, but he quickly became a primary character in the franchise. Gonzo has appeared in every Muppet movie, including The Muppet Christmas Carol, where he played the role of Charles Dickens and formed a comedic duo with Rizzo the Rat. A Christmas Carol, a novella by Charles Dickens, was first published in London in 1843 by Chapman & Hall. The book features the story of Ebenezer Scrooge, an old man who is visited by the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley, and the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come. These ghostly visitors help Scrooge see the error of his ways and transform him into a kinder, gentler person. This list includes all the productions based on the Muppets characters and franchise, including movies, TV shows, and other media. The main work of the franchise is The Muppet Show, a TV series that aired from 1976 to 1981. The franchise has made eight movies: The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, The Muppets Take Manhattan, The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island, Muppets from Space, The Muppets, and Muppets Most Wanted. The franchise also includes other TV shows like Muppets Tonight and The Muppets. Rizzo the Rat is a beloved Muppet character created and performed by the talented Steve Whitmire. He is a fictional rat who has appeared in many Muppet shows and movies, including a starring role in the 1992 film The Muppet Christmas Carol. Rizzo has captured the hearts of fans of all ages with his mischievous personality and hilarious antics. In Greece, a traditional Christmas carol called Kalanta Xristougenon (also known as Christmas Carol) is popularly sung during the holiday season. This carol has been translated into English as Christmas Carol, and is often abbreviated as Kalanta or Kalanda. Some other common titles for this carol include Kalin Iméran and Christos Genate. The carol is typically accompanied by light percussion instruments such as the triangle and guitar when it is sung. Sam Eagle is a beloved Muppet character from the popular TV show The Muppet Show, which aired in the 1970s and 1980s. Sam was performed by the talented Frank Oz. Since then, Sam has been a part of many Muppet movies and TV shows. In The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, The Muppets Take Manhattan, Muppets from Space, and The Muppets, Sam played himself. He also had memorable roles in other Muppet films, such as The Muppet Christmas Carol (where he played the Head Schoolmaster), Muppet Treasure Island (where he played Samuel Arrow), and Muppets Most Wanted (where he played a CIA agent). Additionally, Sam can be seen in the current TV series, The Muppets. William Paul Bill Barretta is an American puppeteer and producer who has been working with The Muppets since 1991. He first puppeteered the character of Earl Sinclair on the show Dinosaurs, and then created new characters for Muppets Tonight, including Pepe the King Prawn, Johnny Fiama, Big Mean Carl, and Bobo the Bear. Barretta has also taken over some of Jim Henson's roles, such as Dr. Teeth, Rowlf the Dog, Mahna Mahna, and Swedish Chef, and briefly took over Jerry Nelson's role of Lew Zealand. In addition to his work on TV shows, Barretta made his film debut as a principal puppeteer in Muppet Treasure Island in 1996, and has since appeared in other Muppet films and TV shows. He has also produced two Muppet TV movies, It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie and The Muppets' Wizard of Oz, and provides additional voices on the show Kim Possible.

It's about 136 miles long and has three big tributaries called North Fork, Middle Fork, and South Fork. These tributaries join the Holston River to form a big river system that drains a big area of northeastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia, and northwestern North Carolina. When the Holston River meets the French Broad River in Knoxville, it becomes the Tennessee River. In the 18th century, a type of explorer called a longhunter would venture into the American frontier wilderness for extended periods of time, sometimes up to six months at a time. Historian Emory Hamilton believes that the term longhunter was unique to Southwest Virginia and nowhere else on the frontier did these types of expeditions originate. These hunters typically started their journeys in the Holston River Valley near Chilhowie, Virginia, where they were landowners or residents. The parties of two or three men (occasionally more) would set out in October and return in March or early April.The Thái Bình River (Vietnamese: Sông Thái Bình) is the main river of the Thái Bình river system in Northern Vietnam. This river system meets with the Red River system, which causes the two to combine and create the Red River Delta. The blackback barb (Enteromius barnardi) is a type of fish that is native to Africa. It can be found in shallow, vegetated waters of three main river systems: the Zambezi River, the Cunene River, and the Zambian portion of the Congo River. This fish can grow up to 7 centimeters in length (SL). The Red River system is a network of rivers surrounding the main river, Red River, in North Vietnam. These branches of the system flow into or receive water from Red River. Together, the Red River system and the Thái Bình river system in the northeast create the Red River Delta, which is the second largest delta in Vietnam. Because the two systems are closely related, they are often referred to as the Red and Thai Binh rivers system. The sediment carried by the Red River system forms the central and southern parts of the Red River Delta. The banks of the rivers are protected by a strong dyke system on both sides. The Cotter River System (CRS) is located in the Australian Capital Territory and was built in 1912. It's a key feature of Namadgi National Park and is one of the two main sources of water for the Australian Capital Territory. The other source is the Queanbeyan River, which is located north of the Australian Capital Territory in New South Wales. However, despite being smaller in size, the Queanbeyan River has been overshadowed by the Cotter River System due to recent drought conditions in the area. The Zambezi River System Action Plan (ZACPLAN) is a joint United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) plan to manage and use the Zambezi River system in a responsible and sustainable way. Eight countries in the region - Angola, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe - are involved in this plan to collectively manage their shared water resources. The Zambezi river basin is important to all these countries, and the plan aims to balance national and international goals for water use while addressing the challenge of increasing demand for these resources. The plan was developed by a UN commission because the large river basin formed by the Zambezi River and its tributaries presented a challenge in terms of efficient use and management of resources. Without proper planning and management, the countries in the region could experience negative consequences, such as inefficient use of resources and conflict over water use. The Pearl River, also known as the Zhujiang or former Canton River, is a major river system in southern China. The term Pearl River often refers to the watersheds of the Xi (West), Bei (North), and Dong (East) rivers of Guangdong, which are all considered tributaries of the Pearl River because they flow into the same delta, the Pearl River Delta. The Pearl River system is the third-longest river in China, measuring 2,400 kilometers in length, after the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, and the second-largest by volume, after the Yangtze. The Pearl River Basin, which covers an area of 409,480 square kilometers, drains most of Liangguang (Guangdong and Guangxi provinces), as well as parts of Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, and Jiangxi in China, and northern parts of Vietnam's Northeast Cao Bằng and Lạng Sơn provinces. The Thái Bình river system is one of the two main river systems in the Red River Delta, Vietnam. (The other is the Red River system.) This system consists of 8 rivers that flow through northern Vietnam. When these rivers join together with the Red River system, they form the Red River Delta. Eastern freshwater cod, also known as eastern cod or Clarence River cod, are a type of big predatory fish that live in the Clarence River system in eastern New South Wales. They belong to the Maccullochella genus and the Percichthyidae family. These fish are related to Murray cod from the Murray-Darling River system, and they're considered a symbol of the Clarence River system."}], "output": "  The answer to your question is:\n\nChilhowie, Virginia.**"},

Congleton is a district in Cheshire, a county in northwest England. Fiona Bruce was born on March 26, 1957, and is a British politician who represents the Congleton constituency in Parliament. She was first elected to the position in 2010 and then won re-election in 2015 as a member of the Conservative Party.The Baronetcy of Dunalley, located in County Tipperary, Ireland, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1800 for Henry Prittie, who had previously served as a member of the Irish House of Commons for several constituencies. His son, the second Baron, also held several political offices, including representing Carlow in the Irish Parliament and Okehampton in the British House of Commons. He also sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1828 to 1854. The title passed down to his nephew, the third Baron, who inherited it when he died. The fourth Baron served as an Irish Representative Peer from 1891 to 1927 and also served as the Lord Lieutenant of County Tipperary. As of 2014, the title is held by the seventh Baron, who inherited it from his father in 1992. Earl Belmore, located in County Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, is a title created in 1797 for Armar Lowry-Corry, who previously represented County Tyrone in the Irish House of Commons. He was first created Baron Belmore in 1781 and Viscount Belmore in 1789, both in the Peerage of Ireland. Lowry-Corry was born Armar Lowry and was the son of Galbraith Lowry, a member of the Irish House of Commons, and his wife Sarah, who was the daughter of Colonel John Corry. In 1774, he adopted the additional surname of Corry by royal license. He was succeeded by his eldest son as the second Earl. Lowry-Corry served in both the Irish and British House of Commons and as an Irish Representative Peer in the House of Lords from 1819 to 1841. He also served as Governor of Jamaica from 1828 to 1832. In 2009, there was an election called a by-election in the Glasgow North East area of Scotland for the British House of Commons. This happened because a man named Michael Martin had to leave his job as a Member of Parliament (MP) and as the leader of the House of Commons after he was involved in a big scandal about MPs' expenses. Martin was the first person in a long time (since 1695) to lose his job as Speaker of the House of Commons this way. The election was held on November 12, 2009, and the winner was a man named Willie Bain, who was running for the Scottish Labour Party. Unfortunately, only about one-third of the people who could vote in the election (33%) actually did, which is the lowest number of voters in a Scottish by-election for the House of Commons ever. Jean-Marie Boisvert was born on September 20, 1939, and is a former Canadian politician and teacher. In the 1972 election, he was elected to the Canadian House of Commons as a Member of the Social Credit Party, representing the riding of Drummond. During his time in politics, he served on several important committees, including the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, the Canadian House of Commons Special Committee on Trends in Food Prices, the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, and the Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament. The Earl of Lanesborough was a title in the Peerage of Ireland, created in 1756 for Humphrey Butler. The Butler family came from Theophilus Butler, who was a member of the Irish House of Commons and was raised to the Peerage of Ireland in 1715 as Baron Newtown-Butler. When Theophilus died, his brother Brinsley succeeded him as the second Baron. In 1728, Brinsley was given the title of Viscount Lanesborough, and his son Humphrey became the first Earl of Lanesborough. Humphrey's son Brinsley succeeded him as the second Earl, and he represented County Cavan in the Irish House of Commons.\n\nHumphrey's grandson, the fifth Earl, sat in the British House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1849 to 1866. His nephew, the sixth Earl, succeeded him and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Cavan from 1876 to 1900 and an Irish Representative Peer from 1870 to 1905. The seventh Earl succeeded his father and was an Irish Representative Peer from 1913 to 1929. When he died, the titles passed to his younger brother, the eighth Earl. However, when the eighth Earl's eldest son died in 1998, the titles became extinct. In 1926, Canada held an election to choose members of the Canadian House of Commons for the 16th Parliament. This election came after a big event called the King-Byng Affair, which involved the Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King, and the leader of the opposition, Arthur Meighen. In the previous election in 1925, Mackenzie King's Liberal Party won fewer seats than Meighen's Liberal-Conservatives in the House of Commons. However, Mackenzie King wanted to keep governing, so he teamed up with another political party called the Progressive Party. Together, they had enough members in the House to form a minority government. Prosper Boulanger was a Canadian politician and businessman who lived from 1918 to 2002. He was elected to the Canadian House of Commons in 1962 as a member of the Liberal Party and represented the riding of Mercier. He was re-elected five times, in 1963, 1965, 1968, 1972, and 1974. During his time in politics, he held several important positions, including Chair of the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Veterans Affairs and member of the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committees on Fisheries and Forestry, Procedure and Organization, and Committees of the Whole. Boulanger also served as a councillor on the Montreal City Council and was a member of the Royal Canadian Air Force from 1939 to 1946. In Canada, the Dean of the House is the member of the House of Commons who has the longest uninterrupted service record without holding a high-ranking position like Cabinet Minister, party leader, House leader, or whip. The Dean plays a key role in the election of the Speaker of the House of Commons at the beginning of each parliamentary term.

In 2007, Jimmy Bartel of the Geelong Football Club won the medal by receiving twenty-nine votes during the AFL season. This was the 80th year the award was given out. James Ross Bartel is a former Australian rules football player born on December 4, 1983. He played for the Geelong Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). Bartel is tall and heavy, standing at 1.87 meters and weighing 86 kilograms, respectively. This versatility allows him to play various positions on the field, including midfielder, forward, and defender.In 2014, the 87th Brownlow Medal was awarded to the player voted the fairest and best in the Australian Football League (AFL) regular season. Matt Priddis of the West Coast Eagles won the medal by receiving 26 votes, while defending champion Gary Ablett of the Gold Coast Football Club was injured and had to withdraw from the race. After Ablett's injury, other players like Joel Selwood of Geelong, Scott Pendlebury of Collingwood, and Josh Kennedy of Sydney were considered as new favorites, but Ablett still ended up as the second favorite to win the award despite his injury. In the end, Ablett tied with Lance Franklin of Sydney, both receiving 22 votes. In 2006, the 79th annual Brownlow Medal was awarded to the player considered the fairest and best in the Australian Football League (AFL) during the home and away season. Adam Goodes of the Sydney Swans won the medal with 26 votes, making it his second victory, after winning in 2003. The 2005 Brownlow Medal was awarded to the player deemed the fairest and best during the Australian Football League (AFL) home and away season. Ben Cousins of the West Coast Eagles won the medal by receiving twenty votes during the 2005 AFL season, which was his first Brownlow Medal win. Interestingly, it was the first time in 86 years that the top two vote-getters were from the same club, with Daniel Kerr finishing as the runner-up.   In 1995, the 68th Brownlow Medal was awarded to the fairest and best player in the Australian Football League (AFL) home and away season. Paul Kelly of the Sydney Swans won the medal by receiving twenty-one votes, making him the unexpected winner. For the first time, the State Government allowed betting on the Brownlow Medal, which some people were concerned about because it could lead to corruption. The top contenders for the medal before the award were Wayne Carey (3/1), Wayne Campbell (7/2), Peter Matera (10/1), James Hird, and Craig Bradley (each 12/1). However, the eventual winner, Paul Kelly, was considered a long shot at 25/1. The Brownlow Medal is awarded to the fairest and best player in the Australian Football League (AFL) each year. In 2015, the 88th Brownlow Medal was given to Nat Fyfe of the Fremantle Football Club. Fyfe won the medal by getting 31 votes during the 2015 AFL season, making him the first player from Fremantle to ever win the award. The 1976 Brownlow Medal was the 49th year the award was given to the player considered the fairest and best during the Victorian Football League (VFL) home and away season. Essendon Football Club's Graham Moss won the medal by receiving 48 votes during the 1976 VFL season. This was the first time two field umpires voted for the best players on the ground using the 3-2-1 system, which resulted in the winner receiving more votes than usual. Starting from 1978, the field umpires instead conferred after each game and awarded a single set of votes, rather than voting independently. The Brownlow Medal is an annual award given to the best and fairest player in the Australian Football League (AFL). In 2011, Dane Swan of the Collingwood Football Club won the medal by receiving the most votes, with 34 votes. This was a record number of votes under the 3-2-1 voting system used at the time, but it was later surpassed by Patrick Dangerfield in 2016, who received 35 votes. The record was then broken again in 2017 by Dustin Martin, who received 36 votes. In 1993, the 66th Brownlow Medal was awarded to the player deemed the fairest and best in the Australian Football League (AFL) home and away season. Essendon's Gavin Wanganeen won the medal after receiving 18 votes during the season.

This battle was a key event in the Stones River Campaign during the American Civil War's Western Theater. It had the highest percentage of casualties among all major battles of the Civil War, with heavy losses on both sides. Although the battle itself was not decisive, the Union Army's successful defense against two Confederate attacks and the Confederate withdrawal that followed gave a significant boost to Union morale after their defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg. The Battle of Stones River also thwarted Confederate efforts to gain control of Middle Tennessee. The Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, also known as the Battle of Ch'ongch'on or the Second Phase Campaign Western Sector, was a crucial fight in the Korean War that took place from November 25 to December 2, 1950. This battle occurred along the Ch'ongch'on River Valley in the northwestern part of North Korea.\n\nAfter the Chinese army successfully defeated the United Nations forces in the First Phase Campaign, General Douglas MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive to push the Chinese forces out of Korea and end the war. The Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander, Peng Dehuai, anticipated this move and planned a counteroffensive, known as the Second Phase Campaign, to attack the advancing UN forces.The Battle of Glendale took place on the Scottish island of Skye between two groups of MacDonalds and MacLeods. According to MacLeod traditions from the early 19th century, the battle happened around 1490. However, some historians believe the battle occurred later, around 1513. According to MacLeod tradition, the battle was one of the most significant the clan ever fought, but it came at a great cost. The MacLeods were initially outnumbered, but when they unfurled their sacred Fairy Flag, they gained new strength and won the battle. Despite their victory, the MacLeods never fully recovered from their losses. The Battle of Berestechko, also known as the Bitwa pod Beresteczkiem in Polish or Берестецька битва in Ukrainian, was a significant conflict fought in 1651 between Ukrainian Cossacks led by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky and their Crimean Tatar allies, against a Polish army led by King John II Casimir. This battle was part of a larger Cossack rebellion in Ukraine that took place between 1648 and 1657, after a two-year truce had expired. The fight occurred in the Volhynia province of Ukraine, on a hilly plain near the Styr River, over the course of three days, from June 28 to 30. The Polish army was positioned opposite Berestechko on the river, facing south towards the Cossack army, which was about two kilometers away. The Cossack right flank was along the River Pliashivka (Pliashova), while the Tatar army was on the left flank. This battle is believed to have been the largest European land battle of the 17th century. Register Cliff is a famous sandstone cliff located along the Oregon Trail, a major migration route for emigrants traveling west in the 19th century. This cliff was listed in guidebooks of the time as a key navigational landmark, and many emigrants would stop here to carve the names of their families into the soft stone. Register Cliff was one of the main checkpoint landmarks for parties heading west along the Platte River valley in Wyoming, helping travelers confirm they were on the correct path and avoid treacherous mountain terrain. It is situated on the eastern slope of the Continental Divide, leading up from the Great Plains in eastern Wyoming. Over 500,000 emigrants used these trails between 1843 and 1869, with many dying along the way due to disease. This cliff played a significant role in the western migrations of the 19th century by serving as a historic landmark and a way for emigrants to leave their mark on the trail. The Umba River is located in northeastern Tanzania, specifically in Tanga Region. It originates in the West Usambara Mountains at an altitude of 2,000 meters and flows northwards along the eastern side of the mountain range. The river then empties into the Indian Ocean, marking the border between Tanzania and Kenya. In the mid-1960s, valuable precious stones such as sapphires and Spessartine were discovered in the upper reaches of the river. Additionally, the Umba River Game Reserve, which covers an area of about 2,600 square kilometers, is located along the river and includes the Mkomazi Game Reserve. Joseph Leonard Follett was an American soldier who fought in the Civil War. He was given the highest award for bravery in combat, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during two different battles.

Follett received the Medal of Honor on September 19, 1890. During the American Civil War, a supply depot, ammunition dump, field hospital, and command headquarters called Savage's Station were located in Henrico County, Virginia, near the Richmond and York River Railroad. However, the historical department of the Norfolk Southern Railroad, which owns the railroad track today, has no records of a train station or house on the property. A farmhouse was located nearby in a group of trees, and it appears in historical drawings and photographs from the time. This house served as a large field hospital during and after the Battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles, and it also served as General George B. McClellan's headquarters during the Battle of Savage's Station in June 1862. Unfortunately, the house was burned by Federal cavalry under General Philip H. Sheridan in 1864. The house was never rebuilt, and no traces of it remain today. However, a 19th-century smokehouse on the property survived until the 1930s, when it was photographed during a survey of local historical structures led by the Civilian Conservation Corps. Sadly, the smokehouse fell into ruin and collapsed before the 1980s. A small 18th-century cemetery still exists near the site of the former house. The Collins Ferry Historic District is located in rural northern Halifax County, Virginia, near the town of Brookneal. The district includes two historic farms, a mill site, and a ferry site along the Staunton River.

The district covers 768 acres and stretches from the river to Bull Creek Road and from the mouth of Buffalo Creek to the Hubbard Farm. Mexico's military history spans over 2,000 years, starting with conflicts between indigenous tribes. These early wars were often fought in the form of flower wars. After the Spanish conquest of Mexico in the 16th century, the indigenous tribes were defeated, and Spain ruled Mexico for three centuries. Mexico eventually gained independence in the 19th century, but internal conflicts among the new rulers followed. The Mexican-American War in the mid-19th century resulted in the loss of two-fifths of Mexico's territory. Throughout the rest of the 19th century, Mexico faced several more conflicts, including the War of the Reform and the defeat of the French during their intervention in Mexico."}], "output": "  None of the battles mentioned in the passage took place in the 19th century.

When you include its longest tributaries, the Darling River system measures a total of 2,844 kilometers, making it the longest river system in Australia. Frenchmans Creek is a small river that flows into the Darling River in western New South Wales. It's about 7.5 kilometers long and starts at an elevation of 54 meters south of Pooncarie, New South Wales. The creek flows down to the Darling River at an elevation of 48 meters.Cow Creek is a tributary of the Missouri River located in north central Montana, about 35 miles long. It originates in the southern foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains in western Blaine County and flows east and then south, joining the Missouri River about 25 miles northeast of Winifred. The creek flows through a canyon that runs along the Missouri Breaks, a rugged and eroded region that stretches out from the river. This canyon provided a pathway for travelers to move between the Montana plains north of the river and the central and southern plains. This route was used by buffalo and Native American tribes for centuries before the arrival of steamboats on the Missouri River. During the steamboat era, the mouth of Cow Creek became a river landing and freighting depot, and a trail led from there to Fort Benton. In 1877, the Nez Perce Indian Tribe had several skirmishes along Cow Creek, including the Battle of Cow Island, and later made a fateful decision to slow down rather than push on to Canada. Today, modern highways have bypassed Cow Creek, and the buffalo and nomadic Indian are gone. The creek is now a remote and isolated spot in the vast Montana Missouri Breaks region. Lithia Springs Creek, also known as Johnsons Run or Lithia Spring Creek, is a small river in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania, flowing into the Susquehanna River. It's about 3.2 miles long and runs through Point Township. The area around the creek is about 8.96 square miles. It has a smaller stream called Johnson Creek as one of its tributaries.

The creek is considered important for coldwater fish and migratory fish, and it's home to wild trout and possibly other fish species. Locks Creek is a small stream in San Mateo County, California, measuring about 1.9 miles long. It is actually a tributary, or smaller stream that flows into a larger stream called Frenchmans Creek. So, in other words, Locks Creek is part of the water system that flows into Frenchmans Creek, which is longer and bigger than Locks Creek. The East Branch South Fork Eel River is formed in Mendocino County, California, when Cruso Cabin Creek and Elkhorn Creek come together. The river is about 25 miles long and flows west through rugged terrain in the Coast Range of California. It has several smaller streams that flow into it, including Buck Mountain Creek, Squaw Creek, Rays Creek, and Tom Long Creek. The river then changes direction and flows north before turning west again, eventually meeting the South Fork Eel River at Benbow Lake State Recreation Area. The East Branch is the largest tributary of the South Fork Eel River. The Red Rock River is a river located in southwestern Montana, USA, and it flows for approximately 70 miles (113 kilometers) through the region.

The river originates near the Montana-Idaho border and the North American Continental Divide, where Hell Roaring Creek flows into the river. The river flows north and west, passing through several lakes and creeks, including the Red Rock Lakes and Peet Creek. Eventually, the river flows into the Lima Reservoir and then through a canyon before emptying into Clark Canyon Reservoir. Prior to entering Clark Canyon Reservoir, the river once flowed into the Beaverhead River, a tributary of the Jefferson River and a headwater of the Missouri River. Frenchman's Creek is a 4.4-mile stream located in San Mateo County, California. Its largest tributary is Locks Creek. The Jemez River is a tributary of the Rio Grande in New Mexico, USA. It starts at the confluence of two rivers: the East Fork Jemez River and San Antonio Creek. These two rivers flow through the Jemez Mountains and Santa Fe National Forest, collecting water from many smaller streams and creeks along the way. The Jemez River is about 50 miles (80 miles including San Antonio Creek) long and flows through a winding course with many twists and turns. The East Fork Jemez River is about 22 miles long and is designated as a National Wild and Scenic River. Both rivers have beautiful meanders and are a popular destination for outdoor enthusiasts. Tomichi Creek is a 71.8-mile tributary of the Gunnison River in Gunnison County, Colorado. It starts north and west of Monarch Pass and flows southwest along the base of Monarch Mountain. Another creek called Congress Creek flows into Tomichi west of Old Monarch Pass and heads south towards Sargents. Agape Creek enters Tomichi just north of Sargents, and Marshall Creek flows from Marshall Pass into Tomichi. Long Branch Creek flows into Tomichi from Baldy Lake to the south, and Needle Creek Reservoir drains into Tomichi east of Doyleville. Hot Springs Reservoir flows into Tomichi from Wanita Canyon west of Doyleville. The Tomichi Valley is a semi-wide valley that allows Tomichi Creek to meander and split into several waterways, making it an excellent place for grazing livestock and mostly private ranch land.

Ford and Frank A. Beach published a groundbreaking book called Patterns of Sexual Behavior. This influential work of scientific literature examines human sexual behavior by drawing on information from a staggering 191 different cultures around the world. The authors also compare human sexuality to that of other animals, with a particular focus on primates. Hailed as a classic in its field, this book served as the foundation for later research by Masters and Johnson. In 1977, Ford and Beach published a revised edition of the book, titled Human Sexuality in Four Perspectives, which further explores the complexities of human sexual behavior. The research team of William H. Masters and Virginia E. Johnson was a groundbreaking group that studied the human sexual response and developed ways to diagnose and treat sexual problems from 1957 to the 1990s.

Chimaji Appa was a skilled military commander who played a crucial role in liberating the western coast of India from Portuguese rule. His most notable achievement was capturing the Vasai fort from the Portuguese in a fiercely fought battle, which marked the peak of his career. Baji Rao (born on August 18, 1700) was a skilled military leader and Prime Minister of the Maratha Empire in India. He served as Peshwa (equivalent to Prime Minister) to the fifth Emperor of the Maratha Empire, Shahu, from 1720 until his death in 1740. Some people also refer to him as Bajirao Ballal.Balaji Vishwanath (Bhatt) was born into a family from the Konkanastha Brahmin community, which is also known as the Chitpavan community, in the coastal region of present-day Maharashtra. His family was from Shrivardhan and was the hereditary Deshmukh (a local administrator) for the area under the rule of the Siddi of Janjira. Balaji left his hometown in search of work and became a mercenary trooper under various Maratha generals in the western ghats. According to Kincaid & Parasnis, Balaji joined the Maratha administration during the reign of Chhatrapati Sambhaji or the regency of his brother, Rajaram. He later served as an accountant for the Maratha general, Dhanaji Jadhav, at Janjira. Between 1699 and 1702, Balaji was the head-administrator (Sar-subhedar) of Pune, and from 1704 to 1707, he was the Sarsubedar of Daulatabad. By the time Dhanaji died, Balaji had proven himself to be a loyal and capable officer. However, he fell out with Dhanaji's son and successor, Chandrarao Jadhav, and switched allegiance to the newly crowned Maratha ruler, Chhatrapati Shahu, who recognized Balaji's abilities and appointed him as his assistant (around 1708). New Palace, located in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, is a beautiful palace built between 1877 and 1884 using black polished stone. It's a popular tourist attraction because of its impressive architecture. The palace has a large garden, fountain, and wrestling ground, and the entire building is shaped like an eight. In the middle of the palace, there is a tall tower with a clock that was installed in 1877. There are smaller towers at a distance, and on each glass panel, there are paintings that depict important events in the life of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Empire. The palace is still the residence of Chhatrapati Shahu, a direct descendant of Shivaji, even today. Additionally, there is a zoo and a large lake on the premises. Rajaram II Bhonsle, also known as Ramaraja, was the sixth ruler of the Maratha Empire. He was adopted by Chhattrapati Shahu, but Tarabai, a powerful queen, claimed him as her own grandson and used him to gain power after Shahu's death. However, after Tarabai was no longer in control, she stated that Rajaram II was not actually her grandson and had only been a figurehead. Despite this, the Peshwa (or chief leader) Balaji Baji Rao continued to recognize Rajaram II as the titular Chhatrapati (ruler) and gave him the title, but in reality, the Peshwa and other powerful leaders held all the real power. Maynak Bhandari was one of the earliest leaders of the Maratha Navy, established by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, and played a crucial role in building and protecting the coastline of the emerging Maratha Empire. Under his command, the Maratha Navy successfully defended the Khanderi fort near Alibaug. Bhandari belonged to the Bhandari caste. Along with another naval leader named Daria Sarang, Bhandari commanded a fleet of 200 ships. Their official titles, Mai Nayak Bhandari (Water Leader) and Daria Sarang (Sea Captain), demonstrate their importance in the navy. The Maratha Navy, which was the precursor to India's present-day Coast Guard, is still remembered and honored through a memorial built in Bhatye Village, near Ratnagiri town. The Maratha Navy was the naval branch of the military forces of the Maratha Empire, which existed in India from around the 17th to the 18th century. This naval force was established by Chhatrapati Shivaji, who is often referred to as the Father of the Indian Navy. Shivaji was the founder of the Maratha Empire and played a significant role in the development of the navy. Baloji Kunjar (also known as Kunjir) was a powerful Maratha leader and advisor to Peshwa Baji Rao II. He was Peshwa Baji Rao II's favorite and played a crucial role in maintaining peace and stability within the Maratha Empire after the death of Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao. Balaji Kunjar successfully mediated a friendly declaration and assurance between Baji Rao II and Nana Phadanvis, which appointed Baji Rao II as the new Peshwa of the Maratha Empire. As a reward, Peshwa Baji Rao II and Nana Phadanvis gave him 14 villages near the Purandhar fort as a gift.\n\nAs a skilled administrator and diplomat, Balaji Kunjar served as the Minister of Affairs (or Vakil) for Peshwa Baji Rao II and played an important role in the administration of the Maratha Empire. He also enjoyed the position of Sur-Patil (सर-पाटील) along with his son Pandoji Kunjar and Narayan, overseeing 360 villages and towns in the Subha of Poona. Balaji Kunjar's family had long enjoyed these privileges, which were a testament to his loyalty and service to the Peshwa dynasty. The Maratha emperors ruled the Maratha Empire in India from the early 17th century to the early 18th century. They controlled much of the Indian subcontinent, including present-day Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. Their power began to decline in the 18th century, and the last emperor was deposed in 1818 when the British established their rule, known as the British Raj. During the Maratha Empire's peak in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, they controlled a large area of the subcontinent, including the eastern region of Bengal, the western regions of Atak and Sindh, the northern region of Kashmir, and the southern region of the Kaveri basin. The Peshwas, who served as subordinates to the Maratha king, later became the leaders of the Marathas and reduced the Maratha king to a nominal ruler. During the final years of the Maratha Empire, the Peshwe were instrumental in expanding the empire's territory. Shahu Bhonsle was the fifth leader of the Maratha Empire, which was created by his grandfather, Shivaji. In 1689, Shahu and his mother were taken captive by a Mughal general named Nusrat Jang. After spending time in captivity, Shahu managed to escape and later defeated his aunt, Tarabai, in a conflict for the throne. Following the death of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, some leading courtiers released Shahu with a small group of men, hoping that he would be a valuable ally for them."}], "output": "  Chimaji Appa was the younger brother of Bajirao Peshwa, who was a prominent leader of the Maratha Empire and served as the Prime Minister of the fifth Maratha Chhatrapati Shahu from 1720 until his death in 1740."},

Mary Elizabeth Day Nursery, also known as Mary Elizabeth Day Care Center, is a historic building located in Sioux City, Iowa. This is the oldest child day care facility in the state of Iowa and the second-oldest preschool. The nursery was established in 1914 by the Wall Street Mission, a local settlement house run by the Methodist Episcopal Church. They moved to the current building in 1926, which was the first day nursery designed specifically in Iowa. The building, a two-story brick Renaissance Revival structure, was designed by local architect Jürgen A. Raven and built by The Lytle Company, a Sioux City construction firm. Parents were responsible for some of their children's care costs, but religious institutions, private associations, and individuals also helped fund it. During the Great Depression, both the federal and state governments started funding and licensing child care, with the Works Progress Administration involved in the 1930s. An additional playhouse designed by Sioux City architect Knute E. Westerlind was built in 1940 and is part of the historic designation. The facility was renamed Mary Elizabeth Day Care Center in 1990 and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997.

Clayton Anthony Fountain was born on September 12, 1955, at a hospital in Fort Benning, Georgia. He was the eldest of six children and was named after his father, Clayton Raleigh Fountain. Clayton's family moved frequently, every 1-2 years, as his father served in the military and his mother worked. As the oldest child, Clayton took on a surrogate parental role, performing tasks such as cooking, ironing, serving, cleaning, and caring for his younger siblings. When his father was away, Clayton learned how to be a man from his father, who had trained him in these responsibilities. In 1974, while serving in the Marines in the Philippines, Clayton was convicted of murdering his staff sergeant and was sentenced to life imprisonment. He was sent to the United States Penitentiary in Marion, which was considered the most secure prison in the country at the time. While incarcerated, Clayton used his military training to murder three other prisoners and one correctional officer with a homemade knife, earning him the title of the Most Dangerous Prisoner in the federal system. The Clear Creek Meeting House is a Friends (Quaker) meeting place located at 14365 North 350th Avenue, near McNabb, in Magnolia Township, Putnam County, Illinois. The building was constructed in 1875 to serve as a gathering place for the Illinois Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, also known as the Quakers. This meeting was the westernmost annual meeting of the Hicksite Friends and attracted followers from several nearby states. The meeting house also hosted the Clear Creek Monthly Meeting, which was attended by local Quakers.\n\nThe meeting house is a typical example of American Friends meeting houses, characterized by its plain exterior and interior design. This simplicity was intentional, as it reflects the Quaker belief in avoiding unnecessary ornamentation and focusing on simplicity and humility. Unfortunately, the Clear Creek Meeting House is one of the few surviving western Quaker meeting houses that represent this tradition of Quaker architecture. John Ingram McMorran was an American man who lived to be 113 years and 250 days old, making him one of the oldest people in the world. He was born in Michigan in 1889 and lived a long life, outliving many of his friends and family members. In his youth, a fortune teller predicted that he would live to be 111 years old, but McMorran actually lived longer than that. Only about one in six people who live to be 111 years old actually live that long, so McMorran's lifespan was quite unusual. When he passed away in 2003, his grandson was a grandfather himself, and his grandson's son was just five years old. McMorran enjoyed smoking, drinking, and eating greasy food, which may have contributed to his long life.   Zeresenay (Zeray) Alemseged is an Ethiopian paleoanthropologist who was the Chair of the Anthropology Department at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, USA. He has recently joined the faculty of the University of Chicago. Alemseged is most well-known for his discovery of Selam, a nearly complete fossilized remains of a 3.3 million year old child of the species Australopithecus afarensis, which is the oldest known child of its kind. This find has provided significant information about the biology and childhood of early human ancestors, an area of little understanding. Alemseged made this discovery while working with the Dikika Research Project (DRP), a multi-national research project he initiated in 1999 and leads. The DRP has made many important paleoanthropological discoveries and continues to conduct research in the field each year. Alemseged's research focuses on the discovery and interpretation of hominin fossil remains and their environments, with an emphasis on fieldwork to gather new data on early hominin skeletal biology, environmental context, and behavior."}], "output": "  The oldest child of Donald Trump is Donald Trump Jr."},

Its roots go back to the Charles City-Henrico County Regiment of Militia, which was founded in 1652. During the French and Indian War, the regiment was led by Colonel George Washington. The regiment fought in several important battles, including the Battle of Great Bridge, the New York Campaign, the Battle of Trenton, the Battle of Princeton, the Battle of Brandywine, the Battle of Germantown, the Battle of Monmouth, and the Battle of Stony Point. Unfortunately, most of the regiment was captured at Charleston, South Carolina, on May 12, 1780, by the British, and the regiment was formally disbanded on November 15, 1783. However, the 276th Engineer Battalion is the successor to the 1st Virginia Regiment, carrying on its legacy. The Battle of Great Bridge took place on December 9, 1775, in the area of Great Bridge, Virginia, during the early stages of the American Revolutionary War. The victory of the colonial Virginia militia forces led to the departure of the British governor, Lord Dunmore, and the end of any remaining British control over Virginia. This event marked an important turning point in the war.The 5th Virginia Regiment was formed on December 28, 1775, in Richmond, Virginia, to serve in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. The regiment fought in several important battles, including the Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, and the Siege of Charleston. In 1779, the 5th Virginia Regiment was combined with the 3rd Virginia Regiment. Two of its commanders were General William Russell and Colonel Josiah Parker. The 9th Virginia Regiment was created in the Virginia State Troops on January 11, 1776. It was organized into seven companies of soldiers from eastern Virginia between February 5 and March 16, 1776. The regiment was later adopted into the Continental Army on May 31, 1776. During the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Germantown, the 9th Virginia Regiment fought bravely, but sadly, over 400 of its soldiers were captured by the British at Germantown after becoming separated from the rest of General Nathanael Greene's division. The regiment was then surrounded and attacked from all sides, leading to its surrender near Kelly's Hill. As a result, the 9th Virginia Regiment was consolidated with the 1st Virginia Regiment on May 12, 1779, and the combined unit was designated as the 1st Virginia Regiment. Unfortunately, the regiment was captured by the British Army on May 12, 1780, during the Siege of Charleston, and was later disbanded on November 15, 1783. The 1st Virginia State Regiment was a group of Virginia militiamen who fought in the American Revolutionary War. In 1776, the Virginia General Assembly authorized the formation of this regiment as a regular force to defend the state. In 1777, Virginia had trouble meeting its quota for the Continental Army, so the 1st Virginia State Regiment was sent north to join the Continental Army in the Philadelphia Campaign. Under the command of Colonel George Gibson, the regiment began its march in July of that year. In January 1778, the Virginia General Assembly decided to keep the 1st Virginia State Regiment in Continental service instead of the 9th Virginia Regiment, which had been captured by the enemy in the Battle of Germantown. The regiment camped at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777-78 and at Middlebrook in the winter of 1778-79, and participated in the Battle of Monmouth. The regiment remained in service with the Continental Army until late 1779, when it was redeployed to Virginia. Unlike the standard eight companies found in the regular line regiments of the Continental Army, the 1st Virginia State Regiment consisted of ten companies, including one of light infantry. The 7th Virginia Regiment was formed on January 11, 1776, in Gloucester, Virginia, to fight in the Continental Army. The regiment saw action in several battles, including the Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown (where they spent the winter at Valley Forge), Battle of Monmouth, and the Siege of Charleston. Unfortunately, most of the regiment was captured at Charleston, South Carolina, on May 12, 1780, by the British, and the regiment was officially disbanded on January 1, 1783. Interestingly, a detachment of the 7th Virginia Regiment, known as the 3rd Virginia Detachment, was involved in the Waxhaw Massacre in 1780. The 6th Connecticut Regiment was formed on May 1, 1775, in New Haven, Connecticut, as a group of soldiers for the Continental Army. The regiment became part of the Continental Line on January 1, 1776, and was renamed the 10th Continental Regiment. Later, on January 1, 1777, it was again renamed the 6th Connecticut Regiment. The regiment fought in several battles, including the siege of Boston, the Battle of Long Island, and the New York Campaign. The regiment's colonel and company of light infantry also served in the Corps of Light Infantry at the Battle of Stony Point. In 1783, the regiment was merged with another regiment and disbanded at West Point, New York. The 3rd Virginia Regiment was formed on December 28, 1775, in Alexandria, Virginia, to fight in the Continental Army. Its first commander, Colonel Hugh Mercer, was promoted to brigadier general quickly. George Weedon took over as commander soon after and was also promoted to brigadier general. Weedon was then replaced by Colonel Thomas Marshall, who was the father of future Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall. During the time the regiment spent at Valley Forge, its commander was Colonel William Heth. The regiment fought in several important battles, including Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and the Siege of Charleston. Sadly, most of the regiment was captured at Charleston, South Carolina, on May 12, 1780, by the British, and the regiment was formally disbanded on November 15, 1783. James Monroe, Thomas Helm, John Francis Mercer, and James Markham Marshall were some of the lieutenants who served in this regiment. On December 28, 1775, the 4th Virginia Regiment was formed at Suffolk Court House in Virginia to serve in the Continental Army. The regiment fought in several important battles, including the Battles of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Charleston. Unfortunately, the regiment suffered a significant loss at Charleston, South Carolina, when most of its members were captured by the British on May 12, 1780. The regiment was eventually disbanded on January 1, 1783, due to these heavy losses. The 12th Virginia Regiment was formed on September 16, 1776, in Williamsburg, Virginia, to fight in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. The regiment took part in several important battles, including the Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, and the Siege of Charleston. Unfortunately, most of the regiment was captured by the British at Charleston, South Carolina, on May 12, 1780, and the regiment was formally disbanded on January 1, 1783, marking the end of its service in the war."}], "output": "  The 1st Virginia Regiment saw action at the Battle of Great Bridge, which led to the departure of Lord Dunmore as the Royal Governor of Virginia."},

In 1772, the British Parliament passed a law called the Royal Marriages Act, which set rules for royal family members to follow when getting married. The law was designed to protect the status of the royal family by preventing marriages that could make them less powerful. At the time, some people criticized the law because it gave the king or queen the power to say no to a marriage they didn't approve of. This law was changed in 2015, and now only the first six people in line to become king or queen (currently Prince Charles, Prince William, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Harry, and Prince Andrew) are subject to these restrictions.

Surus, the last known war elephant of Hannibal Barca's Carthaginian army in Italy, was believed to be a large Asian elephant with one tusk. According to Roman writers, Surus was likely an Indian elephant descended from those captured by the Ptolemies of Egypt, Alexander's successors, during their campaigns in Syria. Some accounts suggest that Surus was the last of the 37 war elephants Hannibal took with him on his historic crossing of the Alps in 218 B.C., during the Second Punic War. Despite the conflicting accounts, Surus remains an intriguing figure in ancient history.

It's one of the biggest aquifers in the world, covering an area of about 174,000 square miles (or 8 states) in South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. This aquifer was named by a geologist named N.H. Darton in 1898 after a town in Nebraska where it was first discovered. It's part of a larger system called the High Plains Aquifer, and it rests on top of a special type of rock called the Ogallala Formation, which makes up about 80% of the High Plains. Ogallala is a city located in Keith County, Nebraska, United States. According to the 2010 census, the population of Ogallala was 4,737 people. It is also the county seat of Keith County. In the past, Ogallala played an important role in the history of Nebraska. The city was a stop along the Pony Express and later the transcontinental railroad, which connected the east and west coasts of the United States. Additionally, the Ogallala Aquifer, a valuable source of water, was named after the city.Keystone is a small community located in central Keith County, Nebraska. It's not a city or a town, but rather an unincorporated place with its own post office. Keystone is situated near the North Platte River and is about 10 miles northeast of Ogallala, which is the county seat of Keith County. The community's elevation is around 3,100 feet (945 meters) above sea level. Although Keystone isn't a incorporated town, it has its own post office with a unique ZIP code, which is 69144. Souris Beach Provincial Park is a day-use park located near the town of Souris in eastern Prince Edward Island, Canada. The beach is shallow, so visitors can walk a long distance from the shore without reaching deep water. This means the water is warmer than at other beaches on the island, because the sun warms it up more easily. Dune Dam is a long sand dune located at the western end of Chaco Canyon in New Mexico. The dune was created by wind blowing sand up the Chaco River. As the dune grew, it blocked the flow of the river and formed a small, shallow lake near the Ancestral Puebloan great house, Penasco Blanco. Archeological evidence suggests that the dune collapsed around 900 CE. The Chacoans repaired the breach by filling it with stone masonry sometime in the early 11th century. This stopped the river from deepening and raised the water table in the canyon, which helped the Chacoans with their farming. However, a geologist named Stephen A. Hall questioned this interpretation, pointing out that there is no plain behind the dam where a lake would have formed. Kingsley Dam is located on the eastern side of Lake McConaughy in central Keith County, Nebraska. It's the second largest hydraulic fill dam in the world and was built as part of the New Deal project during the 1930s. The dam is an impressive 162 feet tall, 3.1 miles long, and 1,100 feet wide at its base. On the east side of the dam is Lake Ogallala, while the Kingsley Hydroelectricity Plant is located on the south side. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District are also nearby. These structures, including the Kingsley Dam, Kingsley Hydroelectricity Plant, Morning Glory Spillway, and Outlet Tower, are the main visual landmarks of Lake McConaughy. Lemoyne is a small community located in northern Keith County, Nebraska. It's not a city or a town, but rather an unincorporated community and census-designated place. Lemoyne is situated along Nebraska Highway 92, which runs along the northern shore of Lake C.W. McConaughy. The community is north of Ogallala, which is the county seat of Keith County. Lemoyne has a post office with a unique ZIP code, 69146. That's all there is to know about Lemoyne! Keith County is a county located in the state of Nebraska in the United States. According to the 2010 census, the population of Keith County is 8,368 people. The town of Ogallala is the main city and the county seat of Keith County. Flatwood soils are a type of soil found in the southeastern United States that have difficulty draining water. These soils are made up of marine sediments and are located in upland areas. The water table, which is the level below ground where the soil is saturated with water, is usually only a few feet deep and can change throughout the year. Flatwood soils are classified by the USDA as fine, mixed, semiactive, mesic Aquic Hapludults. This means that they are made up of a mixture of different materials, are somewhat active in terms of water flow, and have a slightly acidic pH. Ingram-Schipper Farm is a historic farm located near Boonsboro, Washington County, Maryland. It's a two-story house with four bays, made of brick with white trim and a water table. The house has a flat-roofed one-story porch and a slate roof. The property also includes several early outbuildings, such as a brick kitchen and wash house, three log buildings, and a large stone barn. These buildings date back to the Victorian period and provide a glimpse into the farm's rich history."}], "output": "  The shallow water table aquifer located near the county seat of Keith County, Nebraska is the Ogallala Aquifer."},

Akbariyya is a branch of Sufi philosophy founded by the Andalusian Sufi gnostic and philosopher Ibn Arabi. The term Akbariyya comes from Ibn Arabi's nickname, Shaykh al-Akbar, which means the greatest shaykh. While the term Akbariyya has never been used to refer to a specific Sufi group or society in history, it can now be used to describe any Sufi metaphysician or practitioner influenced by Ibn Arabi's Sufi doctrine, known as Wahdat al-Wujud. This is different from Al Akbariyya, a secret Sufi society founded by a Swedish Sufi named 'Abdu l-Hadi Aguéli. The Journal of Human Development and Capabilities is a respected academic journal that focuses on the study of human development and capabilities from a people-centered perspective. It is published by Routledge, and is the official journal of the Human Development and Capability Association. The journal was first established in 2000 as the Journal of Human Development, and was later renamed in 2009 to reflect its broader focus on capabilities. The journal is edited by a team of experienced scholars, including Khadija Haq, Richard Jolly, and Sakiko Fukuda-Parr, who are all experts in the field of human development and capabilities. The Human Development Index (HDI) is a measure of a country's overall well-being, based on three key indicators: life expectancy, education, and income. The HDI ranks countries into four groups based on how well these indicators are performing. A higher HDI score means that a country is doing well in these areas, which means that people in that country are generally living longer, are more educated, and have a higher standard of living. The HDI was created by two economists, Amartya Sen and Mahbub ul Haq, who wanted to understand how well a country is doing in providing opportunities for people to live fulfilling lives. The United Nations Development Programme publishes the HDI each year. Chak 86/6 R is located in the main city of Sahiwal, Pakistan. Its actual name is Rasool Abad, and it is one of the largest populated villages in the Punjab province. The village was well-planned and developed during British rule, approximately before 1900. Today, it has grown into an urban area with all modern facilities.\n\n86/6 R is famous for its Lakkar Mandi, which is the biggest wood market in Asia, and for its religious personality, Syed Mureed Hussain, also known as Baba Mast. Doctor Fazal Din Sehgal was a prominent personality in the area, and he owned 86/6 R and 87/6 R. In the 1930s, the British local government handed over the village to a man named Maher Khar din, who invited families to live in the area and provided them with administrative support.\n\nIn the 1930s, the village was divided into four blocks, and the rest of the land was used for agriculture. Maher Amir U Din, son of Maher Khar din, took over as the administrator in 1958 and played a significant role in developing the area. Now, the area is well-populated and has several sub-areas, including main village 86, Shad-man Town, Baba Must Colony, and Bashir Colony.\n\nIn 2002, the area was upgraded to a union council (UC) during General Pervez Musharraf's regime, and Mehar Riaz Ul Haq was elected as the first Nazim (leader) of the UC, along with Mazhar Javaid as his Naib Nazim (deputy leader). Mehar Riaz Ul Haq is the only person to have been elected Nazim three times in the history of Pakistan.

Hlín appears in old Norse poems, including the Poetic Edda and kennings found in skaldic poetry. Some people believe that Hlín might actually be another name for Frigg. Norse mythology is the collection of stories and legends that came from the beliefs of the North Germanic people. These stories were passed down from before the time when the Scandinavian people became Christian, and they continued to be told and retold throughout history. Norse mythology includes tales of many gods, beings, and heroes that were described in ancient manuscripts, found in archaeological artifacts, and passed down through oral tradition. In other words, it's the body of mythology that came from the North Germanic people's pagan beliefs and continued to evolve even after they became Christian.Frigg gas field is a natural gas field located on Norwegian block 25/1 in the North Sea, which borders the United Kingdom. The field is named after the Norse goddess Frigg. King Olav V of Norway officially started production at the field on May 8, 1978. Production ceased on October 26, 2004. The field is situated approximately 230 kilometers northwest of Stavanger. The operator of the field was the French oil company Elf Aquitaine, which later merged with Total S.A. In Norse mythology, there is a goddess or valkyrie named Eir who is associated with medical skills. Eir is mentioned in three ancient sources: the Poetic Edda, the Prose Edda, and skaldic poetry. These sources were written in the 13th century and earlier, and they contain different information about Eir. Some scholars believe that these sources may refer to the same figure, but there is debate about whether Eir was originally a healing goddess or a valkyrie. Some have also suggested that Eir may be a form of the goddess Frigg, and there are similarities between Eir and the Greek goddess Hygieia.   In Norse mythology, Sága is a goddess linked to wisdom, possibly meaning seeress. At a place called Sökkvabekkr (which could be translated as sunken bank, sunken bench, or treasure bank), Sága and the god Odin are depicted as enjoying each other's company while cool waves flow. Sága and Sökkvabekkr are mentioned in two ancient manuscripts, the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, which were written in the 13th century. Scholars have proposed various theories about the significance of this goddess and her associated location, including the possibility that Sága may be another name for the goddess Frigg, who was known for dwelling in a mythical fen called Fensalir. In Norse mythology, Nanna Nepsdóttir is a goddess associated with the god Baldr. However, there are different accounts of Nanna in different sources. According to the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, Nanna is Baldr's wife and they have a son named Forseti. After Baldr's death, Nanna dies of grief. As a result, Nanna's body is placed on Baldr's ship along with his corpse and they are set on fire and pushed out to sea. In Hel, Baldr and Nanna are reunited. In an attempt to bring Baldr back to life, the god Hermóðr travels to Hel and receives the promise of resurrection from the being Hel. As a token of gratitude, Nanna gives Hermóðr gifts to give to other goddesses, including Frigg (a robe of linen), Fulla (a finger-ring), and others (whose identities are not specified). Nanna is mentioned in the poetry of skalds and is also mentioned once in the Poetic Edda, which was compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to clarify anything. In Norse mythology, Gná is a goddess who helps Frigg, another goddess, by running errands in different worlds. Gná rides a magical flying horse called Hófvarpnir, which means he who throws his hooves about or hoof-thrower. This horse can travel on both land and water. Gná and Hófvarpnir are mentioned in the Prose Edda, a book written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. Some scholars have suggested that Gná might be a goddess of abundance or fertility, and there are also theories that she may be related to the Roman goddess Fama. Hófvarpnir and another magical horse called Sleipnir are examples of horses that have supernatural abilities in Norse mythology.   In Norse mythology, Fensalir (also known as Fen Halls) is where the goddess Frigg lives. This location is mentioned in two important ancient Nordic texts, the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda. Scholars have tried to understand the significance of Fensalir by suggesting that it may be connected to religious practices involving water sources, such as springs, bogs, or swamps, in Norse paganism. Some have also linked it to the goddess Sága's home, Sökkvabekkr, which is also associated with water. Marzanna is a goddess in Baltic and Slavic mythology, associated with the changing of the seasons. She is also known as Марена in Russian, Morė in Lithuanian, Morana in Czech, Bulgarian, Slovene, Serbian, Bosnian, and Croatian, and Morena in Slovak and Macedonian. During the winter solstice, Marzanna dies and is reborn as Spring, symbolizing the rebirth of nature. In Slavic rituals, Marzanna's death marks the end of winter and the beginning of Spring, which is represented by the goddess Kostroma (Russian), Lada (Slavic), or Vesna (Russian). Marzanna is also associated with dreams and is an ancient goddess. In Germanic mythology, there is a goddess named Fulla (Old Norse) or Volla (Old High German). Fulla is described as wearing a golden band and taking care of the goddess Frigg's personal belongings, such as her shoes and ashen box. Frigg trusts Fulla with her secrets. Fulla is mentioned in three important ancient sources: the Poetic Edda, written in the 13th century, the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century, and in skaldic poetry. In the Horse Cure Merseburg Incantation from the 10th century, Volla (Frigg's sister) helps heal a wounded foal. Scholars have come up with different theories about the significance of this goddess."}], "output": "  The goddess associated with the goddess Frigg in Norse mythology is:\n\n* Gná, who helps Frigg by running errands in different worlds.\n\nGná is mentioned in the Prose Edda, a book written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson.

Before he was 35 years old, he was already known as Lord Robert Cecil. He later became Viscount Cranborne in June 1865 and then Marquess of Salisbury in April 1868. Throughout his political career, Lord Salisbury served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom three times, totaling over 13 years in office. Notably, he was the last Prime Minister to lead a government solely from the House of Lords. William Hale John Charles Pery, the 3rd Earl of Limerick, was an Irish politician and member of the Conservative party. He was born on January 17, 1840, and died on August 8, 1896. From 1889 to 1892 and again from 1895 until his death, he served as Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard under Lord Salisbury. In 1892, he was knighted by the Order of St. Patrick.The Queen's Body Guard of the Yeomen of the Guard are the personal bodyguards of the British monarch. They are one of the oldest military units still in existence, created by King Henry VII in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth. As a sign of their historical significance, the Yeomen still wear traditional red and gold uniforms from the Tudor era. Today, there are 60 Yeomen of the Guard (plus six officers) who come from retired members of the British Army, Royal Marines, and Royal Air Force. However, until 2011, the role of Captain of the Queen's Body Guard of the Yeomen of the Guard was reserved for politicians, as the captain is always the government's Deputy Chief Whip in the House of Lords. George Percy, the 5th Duke of Northumberland, was a British politician who lived from 1778 to 1867. He was a member of the Tory party and held various positions in government, including Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard under Sir Robert Peel from 1842 to 1846.

Paleontologists have a hard time studying dinosaur behavior because they only have physical remains as evidence. However, by looking at trace fossils and studying the sicknesses of ancient animals, they can learn some things about how dinosaurs lived. Paleontologists use different methods to try to figure out how dinosaurs behaved, such as examining the position of their fossilized bodies, using computer simulations to study their movements, and comparing them to the behavior of modern animals that are similar to them. Despite these efforts, there is still a lot of uncertainty about dinosaur behavior, and it's likely that we will never know for sure how they acted. However, scientists agree that many dinosaurs were social creatures and often gathered in groups for protection, migration, or to care for their young. Some dinosaurs had distinct crests or frills that may have been used for communication or display, but we don't know much about how they mated or defended themselves. Most dinosaurs walked on land, and studying how they moved is crucial to understanding their behavior. Biomechanics has helped scientists learn how dinosaurs could run, jump, and even create noise with their movements. For example, scientists have found out that diplodocids could make a sonic boom by snapping their tails, and sauropods could float in water.

American and Filipino forces battled against Japanese troops in the capital city of Manila, resulting in the deaths of over 100,000 civilians and the complete destruction of the city. This was the worst urban fighting in the Pacific during the war, and the Japanese committed horrific acts of violence against Filipino civilians. In addition to the massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed important historical and cultural landmarks that date back to the city's founding. The battle marked a significant turning point in the war, as it ended the nearly three-year Japanese military occupation of the Philippines (1942-1945) and was a key victory for General Douglas MacArthur in the campaign to retake the country. The Second Battle of Guam took place from July 21 to August 10, 1944, and was a crucial event in World War II. The American military recaptured the island of Guam, which had been under Japanese control since the First Battle of Guam in 1941. Guam is a U.S. territory located in the Mariana Islands, and its recapture was a significant victory for the United States in the Pacific campaign of the war.On July 23, 1810, a naval battle named Battle of Silda took place near the Norwegian island of Silda in Sogn og Fjordane county. This battle was part of the Napoleonic Wars and involved the United Kingdom and Denmark-Norway. According to British accounts, two of their frigates captured or destroyed three or four Dano-Norwegian gunboats. However, the Danish and British accounts of the battle differ, so the exact details are not clear. The Battle of Calabria, also known as the Battle of Punta Stilo, was a naval battle during World War II. It happened in the Mediterranean Sea on July 9, 1940, between the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) and the British Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy. The battle took place about 30 miles east of Punta Stilo, Calabria. This was one of the few times during the war when many ships from both sides fought each other in the Mediterranean. Both sides claimed to have won, but in reality, the battle was a tie, and both sides returned to their bases as soon as possible. In 791, a battle named the Battle of Río Burbia or Battle of the Burbia River took place between the armies of the Kingdom of Asturias, led by King Bermudo I, and the Emirate of Córdoba, led by Yusuf ibn Bujt. This battle occurred during a period of conflict between the Muslim ruler Hisham I and Christian rebels in the northern part of the Iberian Peninsula. The battle took place near the Río Burbia, which is now known as Villafranca del Bierzo. Unfortunately, the Andalusian forces (the Muslim forces) emerged victorious in the battle. In 1574, a battle called the Battle of Manila took place in the area now known as Parañaque. The battle was between Chinese pirates led by Limahong and Spanish colonial forces and their local allies. The battle happened on November 29, 1574, when Limahong's fleet landed in Parañaque and started attacking the fortifications of Intramuros. At first, the people were disorganized and Limahong's forces defeated them. Unfortunately, Limahong's forces also killed the Spanish commander, Martin De Goiti, which slowed down their attack on Manila. However, a Filipino hero named Galo soon arrived and helped the locals resist Limahong's forces. With Galo's leadership, they were able to fight off Limahong's attack until Juan de Salcedo arrived from Ilocos with 300 Ilocano Warriors. Together, they defeated Limahong and forced him to retreat. After that, Limahong gave up his plan to invade Manila and instead established a temporary kingdom in Pangasinan. On July 4, 1610, a significant battle took place near the village of Klushino (also known as Kłuszyn) in what is now Russia, during the Polish-Muscovite War. This conflict was part of a larger era known as Russia's Time of Troubles. The Polish forces, led by hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski, faced off against a larger Russian army, but managed to secure a decisive victory through their tactical skill and the bravery of their elite hussar soldiers. This battle is still remembered today as one of the greatest triumphs of the Polish cavalry and a testament to the military prowess of the Polish army at the time. The Battle of Alhandic, also known as the Trench Battle of Zamora (Batalla del Foso de Zamora), took place on August 5, 939, in the city of Zamora, Spain. This battle occurred when the troops of Abd-ar-Rahman III attacked the walls of Zamora, which were defended by King Ramiro II of León and his loyal troops. The fighting was intense and bloody, with the bodies of the fallen soldiers piling up in the ditch surrounding the city walls. Despite the heavy casualties, Abd-ar-Rahman III's troops eventually emerged victorious and captured the city of Zamora. This battle should not be confused with the earlier Battle of Zamora, which took place in 901. The Battle of Yao occurred in 1615 during the early Edo period in Japan. This battle took place during the Siege of Osaka, which was a major conflict between the Tokugawa clan and the Toyotomi clan. The Tōdō clan and the Chosokabe clan were two warring factions involved in the battle. Unfortunately, there isn't much information available about the details of the battle, but we do know that Tōdō Takatora led the Tōdō clan and Chōsokabe Morichika led the Chosokabe clan. Despite winning the battle, Tōdō Takatora's two sons were killed in the fighting.   The Battle of Aspromonte, also known as The Day of Aspromonte, was a significant event in the Italian unification process that took place on August 29, 1862. The battle occurred near the Aspromonte mountain in southern Italy, where the Royal Italian Army clashed with Giuseppe Garibaldi's army of volunteers, who were attempting to march from Sicily to Rome and join the Kingdom of Italy. Despite being defeated, Garibaldi was wounded and taken as a prisoner in the battle, which took place a few kilometers from the town of Gambarie."}], "output": "  The Battle of Manila occurred before the Battle of Guam.

The Ethiopian Legal Information Website is an online platform that provides access to laws in Ethiopia. Its purpose is to make it easy for the general public, researchers, professors, law firms, and legal professionals to find and access the basic laws and other legal information on the internet and in digital formats. The website was created by the Law Faculty of Mekelle University in Ethiopia in collaboration with the Non-Western Law Department of Ghent University in Belgium. Currently, the website only contains laws from the federal government, but it plans to add laws from state and regional governments in the future. The main principles of association, which help us learn and remember things, are proximity, repetition, attention, pleasure, and similarity. These principles were first identified by ancient philosophers such as Aristotle (around 300 B.C.) and John Locke (in the 17th century). Both philosophers believed that the mind is empty at birth and that all knowledge comes from learning. These principles are still the foundation of modern learning theories today. Jean du Chatelet, also known as Baron de Beausoleil and Auffembach, was a person who lived in Brabant in 1578 and passed away around 1645 in Paris. He was a scientist who studied minerals, mining, and divination (or dowsing). In other words, he was a mineralogist, mining engineer, and dowser. Disney's 12 Basic Principles of Animation were first introduced in a book written by two Disney animators, Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas, in 1981. Johnston and Thomas based their book on the work of the most talented Disney animators from the 1930s onwards, and their goal was to create more realistic animations by following these principles. The main purpose of the principles was to make the animations look more lifelike by applying the basic laws of physics, but they also addressed more abstract concepts, such as how to convey emotions and appeal to the audience. The Basic Laws of Israel (also known as חוקי היסוד, ħuqey ha-yesod) are the fundamental laws that govern the State of Israel. These laws set out the structure and powers of the country's key institutions, as well as the relationships between them. They also protect important rights and freedoms, although some of these rights were previously protected by the Supreme Court of Israel through common law. The Basic Laws are intended to be chapters of a future Israeli constitution, which has been delayed since 1950. In the meantime, they serve as a de facto constitution for the country. Israel currently operates under an unwritten constitution that combines material constitutional law, common law, and the provisions of these formal statutes. The Basic Laws do not cover all constitutional issues, and there is no deadline for merging them into a comprehensive constitution. The precedence of Basic Laws over regular legislation is not always clear, and this is often determined by the judicial system. Israel does not have a formal written constitution like many other countries. Instead, its laws and arrangements are outlined in a series of Basic Laws that were enacted over time. These Basic Laws were established in accordance with the Harari Decision (החלטת הררי) made by the Israeli Constituent Assembly in 1950, and they deal with the government's structure and human rights. The President of the Israeli Supreme Court, Aharon Barak, ruled that these Basic Laws should be considered the constitution of the state, and this view has been widely accepted during his tenure from 1995 to 2006. However, some people, including one of Barak's colleagues on the Supreme Court, Judge Mishael Cheshin, disagree with this approach and argue that a formal written constitution would be more appropriate. The Physics of Superheroes is a fascinating book written by physics professor James Kakalios. First published in 2005, it explores how superhero stories can help us understand basic physics concepts. Kakalios doesn't try to show where superheroes violate the laws of physics, but instead looks at how comic book scenes can be used to explain different physics principles in an interesting way. For example, he examines how Gwen Stacy's death and Ant-Man's ability to punch through a paper bag can be used to explain ideas like levers and torque. By using comic book elements to teach physics concepts, Kakalios covers a wide range of topics, from mechanics to quantum physics."}], "output": "  Emilie du Chatelet contributed to the basic laws of physics by translating and commenting on Isaac Newton's book \"Principia,\" which contains the fundamental laws of motion and universal gravitation. In addition, she proposed a new conservation law for total energy, which includes the kinetic energy of motion as one of its elements. This law is still considered a fundamental principle of physics today."},

The band started out as a quartet of siblings, but now consists of Sydney, Noah, and Graham Sierota, after their eldest sibling Jamie left the group in late 2016. Initially known as Ready Set Go!, Echosmith signed with Warner Bros. Records in May 2012 and are best known for their hit song Cool Kids, which reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and was certified double platinum in the US and Australia. The song was also Warner Bros. Records' fifth-biggest-selling digital song of 2014, with over 1.3 million downloads sold. Echosmith released their debut album, Talking Dreams, on October 8, 2013. The Goo Goo Dolls are an American rock band that was formed in 1985 in Buffalo, New York. The band consists of John Rzeznik (vocals and guitar), Robby Takac (vocals and bass), and George Tutuska (drums). Mike Malinin joined the band as the drummer in 1995, but he wasn't officially a member until 1998. The Goo Goo Dolls are known for their catchy and popular songs, such as Iris, Name, and Naked, from their album A Boy Named Goo. They have also released other successful singles, including Slide, Black Balloon, Dizzy, and Broadway, from their album Dizzy Up the Girl. The band has had 19 top ten singles on various charts and has sold more than 12 million albums worldwide.The song All That You Are by the American alternative rock band Goo Goo Dolls was released in 2011 as part of the soundtrack for the film Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The song was available for purchase on the Apple iTunes Store on June 14, 2011, the same day the soundtrack was released. This was not the first time the Goo Goo Dolls had worked on a Transformers movie, as they had previously created the song Before It's Too Late (Sam and Mikaela's Theme) for the 2007 film Transformers. Additionally, other artists such as Linkin Park and Paramore also released singles for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon soundtrack.   On July 4th, 2004, the American rock band Goo Goo Dolls released a live album called Live in Buffalo which includes a CD and a DVD. The concert was held in Buffalo, New York and featured the band performing all their popular hits like Iris, Name, and Slide. The DVD has a total of 19 songs, including a cover of Supertramp's Give A Little Bit on the CD. The concert was shot and recorded in downtown Buffalo on Niagara Square in front of Buffalo City Hall. The performance was praised for its unique energy, drawing comparisons to the Talking Heads' legendary concert film Stop Making Sense. Over 60,000 fans attended the concert despite a heavy downpour, and the band continued to perform despite being briefly pulled off stage due to safety concerns. Three songs were skipped from the original set list. Goo Goo Dolls' eponymous debut studio album is a rare find among the band's studio albums. Only an LP (long-playing record) version was released, making it difficult to come by. In addition, the album is out of print and not widely available, which makes it challenging for fans to listen to it. The album features all of the songs sung by the band's bassist, Robby Takac, who was originally the lead vocalist. The song I'm Addicted is the only Goo Goo Dolls track included on the band's 2001 compilation album, What I Learned About Ego, Opinion, Art & Commerce. Another song from the album, Torn Apart, was also featured on the band's 2001 compilation album, Volume Two, which includes other album tracks, B-sides, and rare recordings. The song Notbroken is by the band Goo Goo Dolls, and it's one of the tracks on their ninth studio album, Something for the Rest of Us, which was released on August 31, 2010. According to the band's official website, Notbroken was chosen as the second single from the album. Goo Goo Dolls' ninth studio album, Something for the Rest of Us, was released in August 2010. The band recorded the album in spring and fall of 2009 at studios in Buffalo, Los Angeles, and Australia. Producer Tim Palmer worked with the band, along with other producers like Butch Vig, John Fields, Paul David Hager, and Rob Cavallo. This is the third Goo Goo Dolls album that Cavallo has produced (Dizzy Up the Girl and Gutterflower).

Goo Goo Dolls' third studio album, Hold Me Up, was released in 1990 by Metal Blade Records. This album is significant because it marked the band's true major-label debut, as their previous albums were self-released. The album's first single, There You Are, was also the band's first music video, and some fans consider this album to be the Goo Goo Dolls' last true garage rock album.

He served as a state representative for the Democratic party in Michigan and was also the mayor of Detroit from 2002 to 2008. Unfortunately, Kilpatrick resigned as mayor in September 2008 after being convicted of lying under oath and obstructing justice. He was sentenced to four months in jail, but served only 99 days before being released on probation. In 2009, the mayoral election in Detroit took place on May 5th. Before that, there was a primary election on February 24th to fill the vacancy left when the previous mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, resigned.Jane Marum Roush was appointed by Governor Terry McAuliffe as an interim Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia in July 2015. At the time, she was supposed to serve until the end of the next session of the Virginia General Assembly, which was 30 days after her appointment. However, the General Assembly didn't elect her to a full 12-year term before their special session ended. The Constitution of Virginia says that the legislature can't adjourn for more than 3 days without the other chamber's consent, but the Senate adjourned without the House of Delegates' approval. This means that it's unclear if the Governor could fill the vacancy created by Roush's original interim appointment when it expired on September 16, 2015. The Governor claimed that the legislature was not in session, so he purported to reappoint Roush for a second interim term. If this second interim appointment was valid, it would have expired on February 12, 2016, 30 days after the regular session of the General Assembly began. However, the legality of the second interim appointment is still uncertain. The city of Calgary in Alberta, Canada has held municipal elections every year until 1923, when the election cycle changed to a two-year term for the mayor. From 1971 onwards, the mayoral term was extended to three years. The elections for councillors and aldermen used to be held annually as well, but in 1914, the terms were switched to two-year overlapping terms, with half of each council up for election every year. In 1971, the aldermanic elections aligned with the mayoral elections and were also extended to three years. In 1976, the number of wards increased to 14, with one councillor representing each ward for a three-year term. In 2010, the city council voted to change the title of the position from alderman to councillor, which took effect in the 2013 election. Finally, in 2012, the Local Authorities Election Act was amended to extend the term length of the mayor and councillors to four years. Joseph F. Vitale was born on November 10, 1954, and is an American politician who represents the 19th Legislative District in the New Jersey State Senate. He has held this position since 1998 and is a member of the Democratic Party. Vitale has also served as the Mayor of Woodbridge Township, New Jersey, after being appointed to the position in 2006 following the death of the previous mayor, Frank Pelzman. Prior to his time in the Senate, Vitale filled a vacancy created when Jim McGreevey resigned from his seat in 1997, which paved the way for Vitale to take his seat in the Senate. In 2010, there were two votes in Illinois for the United States Senate. One was a regular election to fill a seat starting in January 2011, and the other was a special election to fill the same seat for the final weeks of the 111th Congress. This was because Roland Burris had been appointed temporarily to fill the seat after Barack Obama was elected President, but there was a regular election to fill the seat again. The two elections took place on November 2, 2010. The 2013 local elections in the United Kingdom took place on Thursday, May 2, 2013. Voting was held in 35 English councils, which included all 27 non-metropolitan county councils and eight unitary authorities. Additionally, there were direct mayoral elections in Doncaster and North Tyneside. These elections happened every four years, but the last time they took place was in June 2009, along with the European Parliament elections. However, County Durham, Northumberland, and Anglesey had their own elections in 2008. Brian DelGrosso was born around 1973 and is a former state representative in Colorado. He owned a small business and was appointed to the state legislature in 2009 by a committee from the Republican Party to fill a vacant seat.

This was notable because other bands in Iceland at that time sticked to more traditional styles. In fact, Tappi Tíkarrass was the first serious music project of Björk Guðmundsdóttir, who would go on to become a well-known singer in her own right. INXS was an Australian rock band formed in 1977 in Sydney, New South Wales. The band started playing covers in Western Australian pubs and clubs, sometimes performing their original music. The main members were Andrew Farriss (keyboardist and composer), Jon Farriss (drummer), Tim Farriss and Kirk Pengilly (guitarists), Garry Gary Beers (bassist), and Michael Hutchence (vocalist and lyricist). For 20 years, Hutchence was the lead vocalist of INXS, known for his charismatic stage presence and good looks. Initially, the band was known for its new wave/pop style, but they later developed a harder, more funk-inspired sound with a mix of rock and dance elements.Bitið fast í vitið (which means Bite Hard In Your Mind in Icelandic) is the debut EP of the Icelandic punk/pop band Tappi Tíkarrass. It was released in late 1982 on the Spor label, just a year after the band formed in September 1981. The EP features five tracks, including one in English, titled London. This was Tappi Tíkarrass's most punk-oriented release at the time, showcasing their raw energy and rebellious spirit. In the 1990s, a band called Steeltown was formed in the city of Brisbane, Australia. They played a genre of music that combined synth, rock, and pop. Their most popular song, Hero, was released in September 1991 and reached the top 40 on the charts. Steeltown was unique because they were the only band from the state of Queensland to sell more records than any other band at the time. You can find videos and live performances of their music on YouTube. The band members were Andy Richmond on vocals, Peter Howard on keyboards, Terry Gidman on drums, Kate Richmond on vocals and percussion, and Reece Spece on lead guitar. Steeltown was formed by members of a Scottish band called The Technicians, who moved to Australia in the 1980s and also had success with their music releases, such as Hot for Love, Clockwork Clown, and Soldier of Fortune. These releases were published by MMA, which was owned by the famous rock band INXS. The Icelandic movie New Life (Nýtt Líf), directed by Þráinn Bertelsson and released in 1983, is a comedy filmed in the Westman Islands. The movie stars Eggert Þorleifsson and Karl Ágúst Úlfsson, along with other actors. The film features music from various musicians, including the band Tappi Tíkarrass, which Björk was a part of. The band contributed two songs to the movie: Sperglar and Kukl (also known as Seiður).   Disco polo is a type of popular music that originated in Poland in the late 1980s, also known as sidewalk music (muzyka chodnikowa). This genre, also referred to as city folklore, was popular in the mid to late 1990s, with its peak around 1995-1997. However, it experienced a decline in popularity in the early 2000s, leading to a temporary collapse. Nonetheless, disco polo has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, particularly around 2007. According to the Polish Language Dictionary Publishing PWN, disco polo is a Polish variant of disco music, characterized by simple melodies. It is a blend of disco, Euro disco, contemporary folk, and Polish folk songs, with a focus on vulgarized subgenre commonly played at weddings and feasts. Kidandali is a unique and distinctive music genre that originates from Uganda, one of only two music genres native to the country. The word Kidandali comes from the Ganda language and can be translated to mean local party or celebration. This genre is typically played or performed during traditional wedding ceremonies (known as kwanjula) and music concerts, which are popular gatherings where people come together to enjoy good music and have fun. Some people refer to this genre as Band music or Afrobeat, although the term Kidandali is most commonly used to describe it. Rave music can refer to two different things. Firstly, it can mean the specific genres of electronic dance music (EDM) that were popular during the late 1980s and early 1990s, such as house, breakbeat, acid house, techno, and hardcore techno. These were the first genres of music played at rave parties. Secondly, rave music can refer to any other genre of EDM played at raves, which may include modern styles like drum and bass, 2-step, and other hardcore techno genres like gabber, hardstyle, and happy hardcore. Rave music is typically presented through DJ mixes, but live performances are also common. Folk rock is a music genre that combines elements of folk music and rock music. In its earliest days, the term referred to a genre that emerged in the United States and the United Kingdom around the mid-1960s. This genre developed from bands like the Beatles, the Searchers, and the Animals in the UK, and Bob Dylan and the Byrds in the US, who played traditional folk music with rock instruments. The term folk rock was first used by American music journalists in June 1965 to describe the Byrds' music, which was released the same month.

It was first released in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and later released for other systems including the Amiga, Amiga CD32, MS-DOS, and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. The Mega Drive/Genesis version has five extra stages that are not found in other versions of the game. Blizzard re-released The Lost Vikings for the Game Boy Advance in 2003. In 2014, the game was made available as a free download through Battle.net, using an emulator called DOSBox to emulate the original DOS-based game. The Paint Gun Testing Initiative is a video game released in 2014 by a team of developers called Aperture Tag. It's a modified version of the popular Portal series made by Valve Corporation, but with a twist - instead of the classic portal gun, players use a new paint gun that fires two different types of gel with unique properties. The game features new characters, voice acting, and a total of 27 levels, including a cooperative mode with a level editor. It was officially approved for sale by Valve and released on the Steam software distribution platform on July 15, 2014. Portal 2 is a puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Valve Corporation in 2011. It's the sequel to the original Portal game released in 2007. The game was released on April 19, 2011, for various gaming platforms like Windows, Mac, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Electronic Arts distributed the retail versions of the game, while Valve handled online distribution of the game through its content delivery service, Steam. Portal 2 was announced in March 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game that involved new patches to the original game. Before the game's official release on Steam, Valve launched a second alternate reality game called the Potato Sack, which involved 13 independently developed titles and culminated in a distributed computing spoof that released Portal 2 several hours early. Portal is a series of video games where you play as a character named Chell and complete puzzles in a science laboratory called the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. The games are set in the same universe as the Half-Life games, but they have their own unique storyline. In each game, you use a special device called the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device, which creates a kind of wormhole that connects two flat surfaces. This allows you to move through the wormhole and reach different parts of the laboratory without having to walk all the way there. The device also helps you to perform cool tricks and maneuvers to solve puzzles and reach the exit of each test chamber. There are also other obstacles in the game, like lasers, light bridges, and turrets, that can help or hinder your progress."}], "output": "  Based on the passage provided, the 2012 action-adventure game that features elements from Portal and Metroid is \"Fez.\""},

It's part of a system in the body called the renin-angiotensin system, which is a key target for drugs that raise blood pressure. Angiotensin also triggers the release of another hormone called aldosterone from the adrenal gland. Aldosterone helps retain sodium in the kidneys, which in turn raises blood pressure even more. So, in summary, angiotensin causes blood vessels to narrow, raises blood pressure, and triggers the release of a hormone that helps retain sodium in the body, leading to even higher blood pressure. Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium levels in the body. It's made in the adrenal cortex, specifically in the zona glomerulosa, and helps conserve sodium in the kidneys, salivary glands, sweat glands, and colon. Aldosterone does this by binding to receptors in the nephron, which is the part of the kidney that filters blood. This binding influences the amount of sodium and potassium that is reabsorbed or excreted by the kidney, which can affect fluid retention, blood pressure, and blood volume. If aldosterone levels are out of balance, it can lead to cardiovascular and renal disease. It's important to note that aldosterone has the opposite effect of atrial natriuretic hormone, which is produced by the heart and helps regulate sodium levels in the body.The sodium-chloride symporter, also known as Na-Cl cotransporter or NCC, is a specialized transport system in the kidney that helps reabsorb sodium and chloride ions from the fluid in the kidney tubules into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule. This process is important for maintaining proper sodium and chloride levels in the body. The Na-Cl cotransporter belongs to a family of transport proteins called SLC12 cotransporters, which use a special mechanism to move electroneutral (meaning they don't change the overall charge of the molecules they transport). The gene for the Na-Cl cotransporter in humans is located on chromosome 16 at position 16q13. In the kidney, there's a part called the loop of Henle (also called Henle's loop, Henle loop, nephron loop, or its Latin name ansa nephroni). This part is found within a tiny structure called a nephron, which is responsible for filtering waste and excess fluids from the body's blood. The loop of Henle connects the proximal convoluted tubule (a longer, twisty tube) to the distal convoluted tubule (a shorter, twisty tube). The loop of Henle is named after the German anatomist who first discovered it, Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle. Its main job is to create a concentration gradient in the middle part of the kidney, which helps the body get rid of waste more efficiently. Low pressure sensors, also called baroreceptors, are located in the veins and arteries near the heart. These sensors detect changes in the pressure of the blood flowing through them. When the pressure in the veins and arteries drops (down to 60 mmHg), the sensors send signals to the brain, which can then release hormones that help regulate blood pressure. These hormones include antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin, and aldosterone. When the pressure in the atria (the upper chambers of the heart) is high, the sensors don't send as much of these hormones to the brain, which leads to more water and sodium being excreted in the urine. This helps lower blood pressure. Additionally, when the sensors in the atria stretch, they send more signals to the brain, which can lead to increased release of a hormone called atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). This hormone causes the body to excrete more water and sodium in the urine, further helping to lower blood pressure. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a medical condition where the body's kidneys can't properly remove acid from the blood. The kidneys filter the blood and remove extra fluid and waste products, but in people with RTA, the acid builds up in the body instead of being removed. This can cause the body's pH levels to become too acidic, which can lead to serious health problems.\n\nThe kidneys have small tubes called nephrons that help remove acid from the blood. When the blood passes through these tubes, the kidneys can exchange acid and other waste products with the blood. But in people with RTA, the kidneys can't do this properly, so the acid builds up in the blood. This can happen for different reasons, such as the kidneys not reabsorbing enough alkaline substances (bicarbonate) or not secreting enough acidic substances (hydrogen).\n\nRTA is different from other kidney problems, like kidney insufficiency, which can also cause acid buildup in the body. RTA is only diagnosed when the kidneys are otherwise healthy but can't properly acidify the urine. There are different types of RTA, each with its own set of symptoms and causes. Inside the kidney, there's a part called the nephron where a specialized tube called the loop of Henle comes into play. Within this loop, there's a bend called the descending limb, and after the bend, the loop splits into two parts: the ascending limb and the distal straight tubule. The ascending limb is a thin and thick portion of the loop, and the thick part is also called the distal straight tubule. This is different from the part of the loop that comes next, which is called the distal convoluted tubule. In the kidneys, there's a system called tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) that helps regulate how much fluid and waste is filtered out of the blood. Inside each tiny unit called a nephron, there are two areas: the renal tubules (where the fluid is filtered) and the glomerulus (where the filtered fluid leaves the nephron). TGF works by sending signals from the renal tubules to the glomerulus to help control how much fluid is filtered. This is done through a process called purinergic signaling, which involves certain chemicals in the kidneys. When there's too much sodium in the fluid in the renal tubules, it signals the macula densa cells to release a chemical called adenosine. This starts a chain of events that helps bring the amount of fluid filtered by the nephron back to a healthy level. In other words, TGF helps the kidneys adjust the amount of fluid filtered out of the blood based on the amount of sodium in the fluid. Sylvia Agnes Sophia Tait (born Wardropper, known as Sylvia Simpson from 1941 to 1956) was a British biochemist and endocrinologist. She worked with her husband, James Francis Tait, from 1948 until her death in 2003, and their collaboration is considered one of the most successful examples of husband-wife scientific partnerships. Together, they discovered and identified the hormone aldosterone, which is important in regulating blood pressure. Aldosterone helps to conserve sodium, increase potassium secretion, retain water, and increase blood pressure. It is believed to be responsible for about 15% of cases of high blood pressure. Distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), also known as Type 1 renal tubular acidosis (RTA), is the most common form of RTA. It was the first form of RTA to be discovered. Distal RTA occurs when the alpha intercalated cells in the cortical collecting duct of the distal nephron in the kidneys fail to release acid into the urine. This failure to release acid can be caused by several factors, leading to an inability to make the urine acidic enough to have a pH of less than 5.3."}], "output": "  Aldosterone."},

These midterm elections will happen during President Donald Trump's term in office. All 435 members of the House of Representatives and 33 of the 100 Senators will be up for election. In addition, 39 state and territorial governorships and many other local elections will also be held. Nancy Elisabet Soderberg is an experienced American foreign policy strategist who has held several high-level positions in government and non-profit organizations. She served as Deputy National Security Advisor and Ambassador to the United Nations during the Clinton administration, and later became President and CEO of Soderberg Global Solutions and Director of the Public Service Leadership Program at the University of North Florida in Jacksonville, FL. In 2011-2014, she was appointed by President Obama to lead the Public Interest Declassification Board. Soderberg has also worked on four presidential campaigns and served as a senior advisor to Senator Edward M. Kennedy. She is a member of the prestigious Council on Foreign Relations and a frequent commentator on national and international television and radio, including NBC, ABC, CBS, CNN, BBC, Fox, National Public Radio, and The Daily Show. Soderberg has written two books: The Prosperity Agenda (2008) and The Superpower Myth (2005). She received her Master of Science degree in development economics and political risk analysis from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service in 1984, and her Bachelor of Arts degree from Vanderbilt University in 1980. Most recently, it was announced on July 12th, 2017 that Soderberg had filed paperwork to run for Congress in the 2018 Midterm Elections in Florida's 6th Congressional District as a Democrat.The 2016 general elections in Wisconsin were held on November 8, 2016. Voters in the state were deciding on several important races, including one of Wisconsin's U.S. Senate seats and all eight seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. In addition, half of the state Senate seats and all of the Assembly seats were up for election. Before the main election, there were primary elections held on August 9, 2016, where candidates vied for their party's nomination. In the United States, midterm elections are held every two years after the presidential election. These elections are called midterm because they take place halfway through the president's four-year term in office. During midterm elections, voters elect representatives to federal offices, including all 435 members of the House of Representatives and about 33 or 34 of the 100 seats in the Senate. The United States Senate has three classes of senators, each with 33 or 34 seats. These classes help determine when each group of senators will be up for election. The idea is to stagger the elections so that only one class is up for election every two years, rather than having all 100 seats up for election at once. For example, the 33 senators in Class 1 were elected in 2012, the 33 senators in Class 2 were up for election in 2014, and the 34 senators in Class 3 were up for election in 2016. In the 2007 Philippine Midterm Elections, a political alliance called TEAM Unity was formed to support the senatorial line-up backed by the administration. TEAM Unity was made up of mostly supporters and former critics of former Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. The alliance aimed to win several Senate seats to protect President Arroyo from impeachment attempts by the political opposition after the midterm elections. The 80th United States Congress was a meeting of the US government's legislative branch, made up of the Senate and House of Representatives. It met in Washington, DC from 1947 to 1949, during the final two years of President Harry Truman's term. The number of seats in the House of Representatives was determined by the 1940 US Census. The Republicans won a majority in both chambers, gaining 13 Senate seats and 57 House seats. Although the Congress passed 906 bills, President Truman called it the Do Nothing Congress and campaigned against it during the 1948 election. The Congress passed some significant business-friendly bills, like the Taft-Hartley Act, but opposed most of Truman's Fair Deal bills. Truman's campaign strategy worked, and the Republicans lost nine Senate seats and 73 House seats, giving the Democrats more seats in the next Congress. In 2002, the United States held its elections on November 5, which was in the middle of President George W. Bush's first term. This was unusual because in midterm elections, the party in power usually loses seats in Congress. However, in this election, President Bush's Republican Party actually gained seats in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Specifically, they picked up 2 Senate seats and 8 House seats. On November 4, 2008, elections were held for the United States Senate, with 35 of the 100 seats up for grabs. Thirty-three of these seats were up for regular elections, and the winners would serve six-year terms from January 3, 2009 to January 3, 2015. In addition, there were two special elections held in Mississippi and Wyoming, for seats that were vacant and needed to be filled. The winners of these seats would serve the remainder of the terms, which ended on January 3, 2013. In 2002, there were important elections for the United States Senate. The Republican Party won these elections, gaining control of the Senate from the Democratic Party. This meant that the Republican Party gained two seats in the Senate, giving them a narrow majority. The seats up for election were called class 2 Senate seats and had not been elected before in 1996. The election was held on November 5, 2002, about 14 months after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks."}], "output": "  According to the passage, in the 2018 midterm elections, Nancy Soderberg will be running for Congress in Florida's 6th Congressional District as a Democrat.

Thompkins and Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan which one was a  case decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court of the United States? \n\n Passage: In the case of Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718 (1982), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled with a vote of 5-4. The Court decided that the Mississippi University for Women's policy of only admitting female students violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In other words, the Court found that the university's policy of excluding male students from attending the institution was unfair and discriminatory. In the Supreme Court case Berghuis v. Thompkins (560 U.S. 370, 2010), the Court examined a situation where a person being questioned by police knows their right to remain silent under the Miranda v. Arizona case, but doesn't explicitly say they want to remain silent or give up that right.In the landmark case of Hoffman v. Jones (Fla. 1973), the Supreme Court of Florida made a groundbreaking decision that changed the way negligence cases are handled in the state. Attorney Sammy Cacciatore Jr. played a crucial role in convincing the court to adopt the comparative negligence rule, which allows victims to recover damages even if they were partially responsible for the incident. In this wrongful death case, William Harrison Jones Jr. was killed by a truck driven by Philip Francis Hoffman Jr. The court's decision marked a significant departure from the long-standing doctrine of contributory negligence, which barred victims from recovery if they had any degree of fault. Instead, the court adopted the pure comparative negligence rule, allowing victims to receive compensation based on the percentage of fault assigned to the at-fault party. This landmark decision has been cited in law school textbooks and has become the prevailing doctrine in negligence cases in Florida. Van Staphorst v. Maryland (2 U.S. 401, 1791) was the first case ever filed with the United States Supreme Court. Although the court agreed to hear and decide the case, the parties settled before oral arguments took place. Collet v. Collet was the first case to be docketed as an appeal with the Supreme Court. And, West v. Barnes was the first case to be decided by the Court. The Supreme Court case of Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt (579 U.S. ___, 2016) is a significant ruling that was handed down on June 27, 2016. The Court decided the case by a vote of 5-3, stating that the state of Texas cannot impose unnecessary obstacles on women seeking an abortion. Specifically, the Court found that Texas' restrictions on abortion services placed an undue burden on women, and therefore violated their constitutional rights. Following this decision, the Supreme Court declined to hear similar challenges from other states, including Wisconsin and Mississippi, where federal appeals courts had also struck down similar laws. This means that other states with similar restrictions may also be affected by this ruling. In the Hirabayashi v. United States case (1943), the Supreme Court ruled that the government could impose curfews on members of a minority group during wartime. This decision came after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the US entered World War II. President Franklin Roosevelt gave military commanders the power to exclude people from certain areas, and Japanese Americans were subject to curfews and other restrictions. Gordon Hirabayashi, the plaintiff, was arrested and convicted of breaking the curfew. He appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled in his favor. Another similar case, Yasui v. United States, was decided the same day. Later, in the 1980s, both convictions were overturned in coram nobis proceedings. In the Supreme Court case Commissioner v. Banks (543 U.S. 426, 2005), the Court ruled on the question of how much of a taxpayer's money judgment or settlement should be considered income for federal tax purposes. The Court held that if the taxpayer receives a recovery through a contingent-fee agreement with their attorney, then the taxpayer's income includes the portion of the recovery paid to the attorney as a fee. However, there is an exception to this rule for certain employment-related cases, as the Civil Rights Tax Relief in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 amended the Internal Revenue Service's § 62(a) to allow taxpayers to deduct attorney's fees from their gross income when calculating their adjusted gross income. In the 2009 Supreme Court case of Summers v. Earth Island Institute, several environmental groups sued the US Forest Service (USFS) to stop them from selling timber from 238 acres of federal land that had been damaged by fires without following the proper process for making decisions and appeals. The court case was decided 5-4 in favor of the environmental groups. United States v. Quiver, 241 U.S. 602 (1916), was a Supreme Court case that started in a lower court in South Dakota. The case involved two members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe who committed adultery on a reservation in South Dakota. The lower court ruled that the couple couldn't be punished for their actions because the reservation wasn't under the jurisdiction of the lower court. The Supreme Court agreed with the lower court's decision, stating that adultery committed by two Indians on an Indian reservation is not illegal under the law. In 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States heard a case called V.L. v. E.L. The case involved a same-sex couple who had three children together and were granted adoption rights in Georgia in 2007. However, after they split up and moved to Alabama, the mother (E.L.) tried to prevent the other partner (V.L.) from seeing the children. V.L. then filed a lawsuit seeking visitation and other parental rights, but the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that the state did not have to recognize the adoption judgment from Georgia. V.L. appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which stayed the ruling pending its decision on a petition for a writ of certiorari filed by V.L. On March 7, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the Alabama Supreme Court's decision by per curiam summary disposition, meaning that the adoption judgment from Georgia was recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court."}], "output": "  Between Berghuis v.

Stacey Kent's 2003 album The Boy Next Door features songs that the jazz singer admires by male singers.Rick Astley's second album, Hold Me in Your Arms, was released in November 1988 on RCA Records. This album was a follow-up to his successful debut album, Whenever You Need Somebody. Like his previous albums, half of the tracks on Hold Me in Your Arms were written and produced by Stock Aitken & Waterman, while the other half were produced by PWL associates Phil Harding, Ian Curnow, and Daize Washbourn. Unfortunately, a fire at PWL Studios delayed the release of the album by a few months, causing Astley to lose some of the recorded material. This was the last album Astley made with Stock, Aitken & Waterman, as he wanted to move away from their dance-pop sound and focus on his own original compositions. After a brief hiatus, Astley returned in 1991 with his soul album, Free. Jamelia, a British R&B artist, released Boy Next Door as her fifth single. This was also the fourth and final single from her debut album Drama. Unfortunately, Boy Next Door didn't do very well on the charts, peaking at #42 and spending only two weeks in the Top 75. The version released as a single was a slightly remixed version of the album version, and it was also shorter in length. In 1983, Australian singer and songwriter Peter Allen released his first album under Arista Records, titled Not the Boy Next Door. This was a significant album in Peter's career, marking his debut release with a new record label. The boy next door is a common trope in storytelling, often used in Western cultures to represent a wholesome, unassuming, or average male character. This character is often depicted as a love interest for a female protagonist who lives nearby. The boy next door archetype is associated with qualities like kindness, humility, and approachability, making him a relatable and endearing character. Stacey Kent, an American jazz singer, covered a popular song for her 2003 album called The Boy Next Door. Many other famous jazz musicians have also covered this song, including Stan Getz, Bruce Eskovitz, Carmen McRae, Lee Konitz, Spike Robinson, Eddie Higgins, and Bennie Wallace. Jamelia's Superstar – The Hits is a compilation album released by Parlophone Records on September 24, 2007. The album features ten of Jamelia's UK Top 40 singles, including her most popular hits like Boweled Up and See It in a Boy. However, the album doesn't include some of her earlier singles like So High, I Do, Drama, or her collaboration with Tiziano Ferro, Universal Prayer. But it does include a new version of Stop, which has never been included on a Jamelia album before. Fire!  (ファイヤー!  , Faiyā! ) is a popular shōjo manga series by Hideko Mizuno that tells the story of Aaron, an American rock star who rises to fame and falls from grace. Serialized in Seventeen from 1969 to 1971, the manga won the 1970 Shogakukan Manga Award. Unlike other male characters in shōjo manga, Aaron is not a boy next door or shining prince, and his rebellious and hedonistic behavior was part of his appeal to fans. Innovative for its time, Fire! featured sexually explicit scenes, a male protagonist, and was the first manga to do so after World War II. While some have interpreted the story as a conservative morality tale, others argue that it was more complex, with readers eagerly following Aaron's adventures for two years. There are even accounts of teenage girls lining up for the next issue to come out. Meg Cabot wrote the 2004 chick lit novel Boy Meets Girl.

However, a small number of them were able to continue fighting as guerrillas on the island until the end of the year."}], "output": "  Walt Zeboski photographed Ronald Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign."},

Captain Dobson, 45, was from Dorset and had been flying Boeing 707s since November 1960. The Boeing 707 is a medium-sized jet airliner that Boeing built from 1958 to 1979. It's called the 707 for short. There are different versions of this plane that can carry between 140 and 219 passengers, and they can fly for up to 2,500 miles.BOAC Flight 712 (also known as Speedbird 712) was a flight operated by British Overseas Airways Corporation using a Boeing 707-465 aircraft. The plane left London Heathrow Airport bound for Sydney, with stops in Zurich and Singapore. On Monday, April 8, 1968, the plane encountered an engine failure during takeoff, which caused a major fire. The engine actually fell off the plane while it was still in the air! Luckily, the pilots were able to make an emergency landing, but unfortunately, five of the 127 people on board died due to confusion and distractions caused by the presence of a check captain. Silver Shadow is a luxury cruise ship that began sailing in 2000, operated by Silversea Cruises. It can accommodate 382 passengers, and there are 295 crew members on board. These numbers are similar to those of Silver Shadow's sister ship, Silver Whisper, which was also built by the Mariotti Shipyard in Genoa, Italy. Both ships have an impressive space-to-passenger ratio of 74, meaning they provide more space per passenger than any other cruise ship. To calculate this ratio, we divide the ship's gross tonnage by its passenger capacity. Additionally, the passenger-to-crew ratio for Silver Shadow is high, at 1.31 to 1. Silver Whisper is a cruise ship that started sailing in 2000 and is run by Silversea Cruises. It can accommodate 382 passengers, and there are 295 crew members on board. These numbers are similar to those of its sister ship, Silver Shadow, which was also built by the Mariotti Shipyard in Genoa, Italy. What's interesting about these two ships is that they have a very high space-to-passenger ratio, which means there's more space per passenger than on any other cruise ship. In fact, the space-to-passenger ratio for Silver Whisper is 74, which is impressive. Additionally, there are a lot of crew members compared to the number of passengers, with a passenger-to-crew ratio of 1.31 to 1. This means that there's one crew member for every 1.31 passengers.   During World War II, a flight called Ball-bearing Run operated between Stockholm, Sweden and Leuchars, Scotland. This flight was actually operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force, but for political reasons, it was disguised as a regular flight by the British airline BOAC. The Norwegian crew wore BOAC uniforms and carried British passports to mislead enemy forces. On June 1, 1943, BOAC Flight 777-A was flying from Lisbon, Portugal to Bristol, England with 17 people on board. The flight was attacked by 8 German Junkers Ju 88s during the journey and crashed into the Bay of Biscay. Unfortunately, everyone on the plane died in the crash. There were some notable passengers on the flight, including actor Leslie Howard. Royal Caribbean International has a group of three cruise ships called the Freedom class. The first ship in this class, Freedom of the Seas, was the biggest passenger ship in the world when it was built in 2006, with the capacity to hold the most passengers and the largest gross tonnage of any ship ever built. When the Oasis of the Seas was completed in 2009, it surpassed Freedom of the Seas as the largest passenger ship in the world, but the other two ships in the Freedom class, Liberty of the Seas and Independence of the Seas, still hold the records for being the largest ships ever built in terms of passenger capacity and gross tonnage. MV Caledonian Isles is one of the biggest ships owned by Caledonian Maritime Assets Limited. It's operated by Caledonian MacBrayne (CalMac), which runs ferries to different islands in Scotland. Caledonian Isles travels on the Ardrossan to Brodick route, which is one of CalMac's busiest routes. This route is popular among tourists, and Caledonian Isles can carry up to 1,000 passengers and 110 cars in a single trip, with a travel time of 55 minutes. During the summer, many people use Caledonian Isles for day trips to the Isle of Arran.

She was an actress, courtesan, and companion to the future King William IV of the United Kingdom. For 20 years, Dorothea was the mistress of William, who was then the Duke of Clarence. During their relationship, they had 10 illegitimate children together, all of whom were given the surname FitzClarence. Elizabeth Hay, Countess of Erroll, was born on January 17, 1801, to King William IV of the United Kingdom and his mistress, Dorothea Jordan. At the age of 19, she married William Hay, the 18th Earl of Erroll, and became Countess of Erroll on December 4, 1820. Because of her prestigious parents, her husband became Lord Steward of the Household. Elizabeth and William Hay married at St George's, Hanover Square in London. She kept two mementos from her father, a stone and a pair of gloves, which she wore on opening his first Parliament. Elizabeth passed away in Edinburgh, Scotland, on January 16, 1856.Amelia Cary, Viscountess Falkland, was a British noblewoman who lived from March 21, 1807, to July 2, 1858. She was born as the fifth illegitimate daughter of King William IV of the United Kingdom (who later became the Duke of Clarence) and his long-time mistress, Dorothea Jordan. Amelia had four sisters and five brothers, all of whom were given the surname FitzClarence after their father became king. Since Amelia was a granddaughter of King George III, she was named after her aunt, Princess Amelia.   John Crichton-Stuart, the 5th Marquess of Bute, was born on August 4, 1907, and passed away on August 14, 1956. His parents were John Crichton-Stuart, the 4th Marquess of Bute, and Augusta Bellingham. On his father's side, the 5th Marquess was a direct male descendant of Robert II of Scotland through John Stewart, the illegitimate son of Robert II and Moira Leitch. On his mother's side, the 5th Marquess was a descendant of William IV of the United Kingdom through Elizabeth Hay, Countess of Erroll, one of William IV's illegitimate daughters with his mistress, Dorothea Jordan. Therefore, the 5th Marquess was the first member of the Bute family to be descended from William IV. Lady Mary Fox was born on December 19, 1798, to King William IV of the United Kingdom and his mistress, Dorothea Jordan. Because her parents were not married, Lady Mary was considered an illegitimate child. However, she went on to become a writer in later life. Lieutenant-General Lord Frederick FitzClarence was a British Army officer who was born on December 9, 1799, and died on October 30, 1854. He was the illegitimate son of King William IV, who was having an affair with a woman named Dorothea Jordan at the time of Frederick's birth. Lady Augusta Gordon was a British noblewoman who lived from 1803 to 1865. She was born as the fourth illegitimate daughter of King William IV of the United Kingdom (who was also known as the Duke of Clarence at the time) and his long-time mistress, Dorothea Jordan. Augusta grew up at their residence in Teddington, called Bushy House. She had four sisters and five brothers, all of whom were also surnamed FitzClarence. When their father became king, the FitzClarence children were raised to the ranks of younger children of a marquess. Sophia Sidney, Baroness De L'Isle and Dudley (born FitzClarence; March 4, 1795 - April 10, 1837) was the eldest illegitimate child of King William IV of the United Kingdom and his longtime mistress Dorothea Jordan. She married Philip Sidney, 1st Baron De L'Isle and Dudley, and had four surviving children. Prior to her death in 1837, she served as Housekeeper at Kensington Palace. The Regency Act of 1830 (also known as 1 Will.4 c.2) was a law passed by the British Parliament in case King William IV died before the next person in line to the throne turned 18. If this had happened, the Act would have taken effect and a regent would have ruled until the new monarch reached the age of 18. Additionally, the Act allowed for a posthumous child of King William IV to become queen if he died without a legitimate heir. However, since William IV did not have any surviving legitimate children, Queen Victoria became queen at the age of 18 in 1837 and the Regency Act never went into effect. Wilhelmina FitzClarence, Countess of Munster (born June 27, 1830), was a British noblewoman and writer. Her mother, Lady Augusta FitzClarence, was the illegitimate daughter of King William IV of the United Kingdom. Wilhelmina, also known as Mina, was born the day after her father's succession to the throne. As a young girl, she traveled extensively throughout Europe, visiting the courts of France and Hanover. In 1855, Mina married her first cousin, William FitzClarence, the 2nd Earl of Munster, and they had nine children together, including the 3rd and 4th Earls of Munster."}], "output": "  The answer to your question is: Dorothea Jordan."}]

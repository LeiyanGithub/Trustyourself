Kaiser in the 1940s to supply steel plates to the shipbuilding industry on the Pacific coast, which expanded during World War II, then contracted, and then grew again during the Korean War. One of the shipyards Kaiser operated was California Shipbuilding Corporation on Terminal Island, California, which built hundreds of Liberty ships and Victory ships during World War II. Kaiser Steel was known for making the most of its expensive steel production inputs and eventually captured a significant share of the Pacific Coast steel market by the 1950s.

Henry John Kaiser was an American businessman who became famous for revolutionizing the shipbuilding industry in the United States. Born in 1882 and passing away in 1967, Kaiser founded Kaiser Shipyards during World War II, which produced Liberty ships that played a crucial role in the war effort. After this success, he went on to establish Kaiser Aluminum and Kaiser Steel, two companies that further solidified his legacy.\n\nKaiser was also a pioneer in the field of healthcare, as he established Kaiser Permanente, a healthcare program that provided medical care to his workers and their families.

The SRs then split into two groups: pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik. The anti-Bolshevik group, known as the Right SRs, remained loyal to the leader of the Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, but they were defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Russian Civil War (1917-1922) was a complex and multi-sided conflict in Russia after the Russian Revolutions of 1917. Many different groups, including the Red Army (fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin) and the White Army (comprised of various factions supporting monarchism, capitalism, and alternative forms of socialism), fought to determine Russia's political future. Other groups, such as militant socialists and non-ideological Green armies, also participated in the conflict. Eight foreign nations intervened in the war, including the Allied Forces and pro-German armies. The Red Army ultimately defeated the White Army in key battles in Ukraine and Siberia in 1919, and the remaining White forces were defeated in Crimea and evacuated in 1920. Some minor skirmishes continued until 1923, but the war effectively ended in 1923 when Red control was established in the newly formed Soviet Union. The conflict resulted in an estimated 7-12 million casualties, mostly civilians, and has been described as the greatest national catastrophe Europe had seen."}], "output": "  The Russian Civil War ended when the Red Army defeated the White Army in 1923. **"},

This happens when the rear of the car turns more than the front, causing the front wheels to point in the opposite direction of the turn. This is known as oversteering. When this happens, the driver needs to use the steering wheel in the opposite direction of the turn to maintain control of the car, which is called counter-steering. This technique is often used in racing and stunt driving to create a dramatic and impressive turn. D1NZ is the premier drifting series in New Zealand, serving as a clubsport advanced event under MotorSport New Zealand. It was established in 2003 as a small competition among drifting teams from different parts of the country to organize and regulate drifting events. Over the years, the series has grown bigger and more professional, featuring professional drivers with sponsored cars. The series now consists of two championships: Pro and Pro-sport. New competitors typically need to prove themselves in the Pro-sport championship before moving up to the Pro championship, unless they come from an equivalent international series. The organizers aim to promote and educate drifting in New Zealand while providing a safe and regulated environment for competitors. It's important to note that D1NZ is not related to the Japanese D1 Grand Prix series, and it's actually the longest running drifting series in the world."}], "output": "  Drifting.**"},

Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional? \n\n Passage:   In the Rostker v. Goldberg case, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 1981 that the practice of only requiring men to register for the draft was constitutional. After much debate and discussion in Congress, the law was passed to apply only to men. Later, some lawyers, including Robert L. Goldberg, challenged the law, arguing that it was unfair to only require men to register. In a 6-3 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that the law was not a violation of the equal protection clause of the due process clause and allowed the law to stand as is. (The named defendant in the case is Bernard D. Rostker, the Director of the Selective Service System.) In the United States, conscription, also known as the draft, has been used by the federal government in four major conflicts: the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars). The draft was created in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act, which was the first peacetime draft in the country's history. From 1940 to 1973, men were drafted into the military to fill vacancies that couldn't be filled through voluntary means, both during peacetime and times of conflict. The draft was discontinued when the military transitioned to an all-volunteer force. However, all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are still required to register with the Selective Service System, which remains in place as a contingency plan in case a draft is needed again in the future."}], "output": "  Conscription.**"},

This book is credited with playing a crucial role in advancing the feminist movement. Journalist Liza Featherstone has acknowledged that Millett's efforts have contributed to several significant advancements in women's rights, including the legalization of abortion, greater gender equality in the workplace, and a greater sense of sexual freedom. In other words, Millett's work has helped pave the way for many of the rights and freedoms that women enjoy today. Kate Millett wrote the book Sexual Politics in 1970, which was based on her PhD dissertation. The book provides an in-depth analysis of the relationship between sex and power, and how it affects society. Millett's groundbreaking work challenged traditional notions of gender roles and sexuality, and it remains an influential work in the fields of feminist theory and sexual politics."}], "output": "  St Hilda's College, Oxford**."},

American and Filipino soldiers fought against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines. The battle lasted for a month and resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 civilians and the complete destruction of the city. The fighting was some of the worst in the Pacific and Japanese soldiers committed mass murder against Filipino civilians. The battle also destroyed important historical buildings and cultural landmarks that date back to the city's founding. After three years of Japanese occupation, the city was finally captured, which was a key victory for General Douglas MacArthur in the campaign to retake the Philippines. During the American Civil War, there were six major battles fought over the course of seven days in June and July 1862 near Richmond, Virginia. Confederate General Robert E. Lee successfully drove the Union Army of the Potomac, led by Major General George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula. Although some people call this series of battles the Seven Days Campaign, it was actually the final part of a larger military operation known as the Peninsula Campaign."}], "output": "  Seven Days Battles.**"},

Harrison wrote the song in 1967, while he was still a member of the Beatles, in response to the public reaction to Paul McCartney's announcement that he had taken the drug LSD. This news caused a similar reaction in the media as John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity in 1966. The song's lyrics encourage self-awareness and careful consideration of one's actions, while the music features unusual time signature changes from the standard 4/4 beat to 9/8. The song's lyrics also reflect the era in which it was written by revisiting themes first introduced in Beatles songs like Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love. George Harrison wrote the song Within You Without You for the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967. This was Harrison's second song written in the Indian classical style, after Love You To. He was inspired to write the song after spending six weeks in India with his sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, in September and October of 1966. The song features Indian instruments like the sitar, dilruba, and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle. The recording was different from the Beatles' usual work because it had a spiritual and introspective feel to it, reflecting Harrison's interest in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas. Although Harrison was the only Beatle to contribute a composition to the album, his support for Indian culture is evident in the inclusion of Indian spiritual leaders like Paramahansa Yogananda on the album cover."}], "output": "  George Harrison.**"},

The leaves are long and narrow, with rounded teeth, and they grow in groups of six along the branches. In the summer, the tree produces white flowers that are packed closely together on long stems that grow from the leaf axils.

They are similar to the hormone testosterone, which is already in the body. There are two types of anabolic steroids: natural ones, like testosterone, and synthetic ones that are made in a lab and have similar effects to testosterone. These steroids help build muscle, especially in the muscles of the body, and also have effects on other parts of the body, like the voice and body hair. The term anabolic comes from the Greek word anabole, which means something that is thrown up or built up. Anabolic steroids are one of three types of hormone agonists, which means they act like other hormones in the body. The other two types are estrogens (like estradiol) and progestogens (like progesterone). Anabolic steroids are drugs that are made from the male hormone testosterone. They're used for building muscle and getting stronger, both for cosmetic reasons and to improve athletic performance. These drugs work in several ways, including increasing the amount of protein built in muscles and stopping the process of breaking down muscle tissue for energy. Many teens and adults use steroids because they help muscles grow faster than they would on their own.\n\nI hope this helps!

This process happens when the air is heated and expands, and then cools and contracts. Throughout history, different types of hot air engines have been developed, including open-cycle engines like those invented by Sir George Cayley and John Ericsson, and closed-cycle engines like the one invented by Robert Stirling. Unlike internal combustion engines and steam engines, hot air engines use the expansion and contraction of air to generate power, rather than burning fuel or boiling water. Sir George Cayley was a very important English engineer who lived from 1773 to 1857. He is considered one of the most important people in the history of flying machines. Many people think he was the first person to understand how flying works and the first to use science to study flying.

Gibb or Reynolds v. Sims? \n\n Passage: In the landmark Supreme Court case Reynolds v. Sims (1964), the Court ruled that state legislative districts must be roughly equal in population when electing any chamber of a state legislature. This decision overturned the traditional role of state senates, which allowed rural areas to balance out the influence of large cities. The case was brought by a voter in Alabama named M.O. Sims, who argued that the unequal distribution of population in Alabama's state legislative districts unfairly gave more power to urban areas. The ruling had a significant impact on both northern and southern states, as many had failed to reapportion their legislatures in line with changes in state population. In the landmark case of Selle v. Gibb (1984), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit established an important principle regarding the doctrine of striking similarities. The court ruled that while copying must be proven by showing both access and substantial similarity, if there is no evidence of access, striking similarities can raise an inference of copying. This is done by showing that the similarities between the two works could not have been the result of independent creation, coincidence, or a common source. In other words, striking similarity alone is not enough to infer access, but if the similarities are so striking that they preclude the possibility of independent creation, it can raise an inference that the works were copied."}], "output": "  Reynolds v.

When light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometers enters our eyes, we see blue. Blues with a higher frequency (shorter wavelength) appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency (longer wavelength) gradually appear more green. Pure blue, with a wavelength of 470 nanometers, is right in the middle. In painting and traditional color theory, blue is one of the three main colors of pigments, along with red and yellow. When you mix red and blue together, you get violet, and mixing blue and yellow creates green. Blue is also a primary color in the RGB color model used to make all the colors on a TV or computer screen. Innocent Records was created by EMI to cater to the pop side of their Virgin Records label. After the success of the Spice Girls, Virgin decided to focus more on pop music and hired Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records (known for helping Take That become a successful act) to launch his own label within Virgin. Goldsmith signed artists such as Billie Piper and Martine McCutcheon, as well as some dance acts like Todd Terry. The label did well in the mid-2000s with acts like Atomic Kitten and Blue selling Platinum records."}], "output": "  The act for Innocent Records that achieved Platinum sales and shares its name with a primary color in the RGB color model is Blue.**"},

In the 18th century, a type of explorer called a longhunter would venture into the American frontier wilderness for extended periods of time, sometimes up to six months at a time. Historian Emory Hamilton believes that the term longhunter was unique to Southwest Virginia and nowhere else on the frontier did these types of expeditions originate. These hunters typically started their journeys in the Holston River Valley near Chilhowie, Virginia, where they were landowners or residents. The parties of two or three men (occasionally more) would set out in October and return in March or early April."}], "output": " Holston River Valley near Chilhowie, Virginia.**"},

It's part of a system in the body called the renin-angiotensin system, which is a key target for drugs that raise blood pressure. Angiotensin also triggers the release of another hormone called aldosterone from the adrenal gland. Aldosterone helps retain sodium in the kidneys, which in turn raises blood pressure even more. So, in summary, angiotensin causes blood vessels to narrow, raises blood pressure, and triggers the release of a hormone that helps retain sodium in the body, leading to even higher blood pressure. Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that plays a crucial role in regulating sodium levels in the body. It's made in the adrenal cortex, specifically in the zona glomerulosa, and helps conserve sodium in the kidneys, salivary glands, sweat glands, and colon. Aldosterone does this by binding to receptors in the nephron, which is the part of the kidney that filters blood. This binding influences the amount of sodium and potassium that is reabsorbed or excreted by the kidney, which can affect fluid retention, blood pressure, and blood volume. If aldosterone levels are out of balance, it can lead to cardiovascular and renal disease. It's important to note that aldosterone has the opposite effect of atrial natriuretic hormone, which is produced by the heart and helps regulate sodium levels in the body."}], "output": "  Angiotensin.**"},

Passage: The Socialist Revolutionary Party, or Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (the SRs; Russian: Партия социалистов-революционеров (ПСР), эсеры , esery) was a major political party in early 20th century Russia and a key player in the Russian Revolution.  Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms.  After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government.  In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.  The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.  The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражда́нская война́ в Росси́и , Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi ; November 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.  The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen."}], "output": " Rephrased paragraph: The anti-Bolshevik faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, led by Alexander Kerensky, was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War, which lasted from 1917 to 1922.

From its formation in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps, it has flown a variety of aircraft types including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C).  During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions.  It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities.  The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937.  It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.  The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra.  It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C Wedgetail.  One of the six Boeing 737s was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS. The English Electric Canberra is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber that was manufactured during the 1950s.  It was developed by English Electric during the mid-to-late 1940s in response to a 1944 Air Ministry requirement for a successor to the wartime de Havilland Mosquito fast-bomber.  Amongst the performance requirements for the type was the demand for an outstanding high altitude bombing capability in addition to flying at high speeds.  These were partly accomplished by making use of newly developed jet propulsion technology.  When the Canberra was introduced to service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), the type's first operator, in May 1951, it became the service's first jet-powered bomber aircraft."}], "output": " Rephrased paragraph: The English Electric Canberra is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber that was used by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during the South West Pacific theatre of World War II."},

Passage: Drifting is a driving technique where the driver intentionally oversteers, with loss of traction in the rear wheels or all tires, while maintaining control and driving the car through the entirety of a corner.  Car drifting is caused when the rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle, to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering). D1NZ is a production car drifting series in New Zealand.  There is currently no New Zealand drifting championship so D1NZ is the premier series running as a clubsport advanced event under MotorSport New Zealand.  It began early in 2003 as a small competition consisting of several drifting teams from all over the country in order to organise and regulate Drifting events on the circuit.  Since then it has continued to grow larger and more professional, now involving professional drivers with sponsored cars.  The series now includes two championships: Pro and Pro-sport.

Passage: Aonghus Mór mac Domhnaill (died c.1293) was a leading figure in the thirteenth-century kingdoms of the Isles and Scotland.  He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle.  Aonghus Mór appears to have succeeded his father in the mid part of the thirteenth century.  At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown.  Aonghus Mór's first certain appearance in the historical record seems to evince his involvement in aiding native Irish kindreds against the consolidation of Anglo-Irish authority in the north-west Ireland.  Such cooperation could have been undertaken in the context of overseas kindreds like Clann Domhnaill constructing Irish alliances to gain assistance against Scottish encroachment. The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD.  The islands were known to the Norse as the Suðreyjar, or Southern Isles as distinct from the Norðreyjar or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland.  The historical record is incomplete, and the kingdom was not a continuous entity throughout the entire period.  The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, although only some of the later rulers claimed that title.  At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney.

The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the American League (AL) East division.  As one of the AL's original eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis, Missouri to become the St. Louis Browns.  After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney/civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. The team's current majority owner is lawyer Peter Angelos.

Passage: See Yourself is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3.  Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love. Within You Without You is a song written by George Harrison and released on the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after Love You To, and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September–October 1966.  Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle.  The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.  Although the song was his only composition on Sgt. Pepper, Harrison's endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover."}], "output": " Rephrased paragraph: The English musician George Harrison is known for writing two songs: \"See Yourself\" and \"Within You Without You.\" \"See Yourself\" was released on Harrison's 1976 album \"Thirty Three & 1/3\" and was inspired by the public reaction to Paul McCartney's admission of taking LSD.

Passage: Anabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone.  They are anabolic and increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles, and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of the vocal cords and body hair.  The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, that which is thrown up, mound.  They are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. Anabolic/androgenic steroids are drugs that are obtained from the male hormone, testosterone.  Anabolic steroids are used for muscle-building and strength gain for cosmetic reasons as well as for performance-enhancement in athletics and bodybuilding.  Anabolic steroids work in many ways by increasing protein synthesis in the muscles and by eliminating the catabolic process (the process of breaking down skeletal muscle for energy).

These engines may be based on a number of thermodynamic cycles encompassing both open cycle devices such as those of Sir George Cayley and John Ericsson and the closed cycle engine of Robert Stirling.  Hot air engines are distinct from the better known internal combustion based engine and steam engine.

Many consider him to be the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of flight."}], "output": " Rephrased paragraph: The English engineer Sir George Cayley, who passed away on December 15, 1857, played a significant role in the development of the hot air engine through his work on open-cycle devices. A hot air engine, also known as an air engine or caloric engine, is a type of heat engine that utilizes the expansion and contraction of air due to changes in temperature to convert thermal energy into mechanical work. Cayley's contributions to the field of hot air engines were among the first and most influential, along with those of other engineers such as John Ericsson and Robert Stirling. While hot air engines are distinct from internal combustion and steam engines, they remain an important part of the history of mechanical engineering."},

The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera, in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s, the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season.  The owners of the theatre, usually noble amateurs, charged the impresario with hiring a composer (until the 1850s operas were expected to be new) and the orchestra, singers, costumes and sets, all while assuming considerable financial risk.  In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce Der Schauspieldirektor (The Impresario).  Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice, where his opera Orlando finto pazzo was followed by numerous others.

Most long hunts started in the Holston River Valley near Chilhowie, Virginia.  The hunters came from there and the adjacent valley of the Clinch River, where they were land owners or residents.

Passage: Angiotensin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and a subsequent increase in blood pressure.  It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that raises blood pressure.  Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex.  Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up. Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.  It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon.  It plays a central role in the regulation of the plasma sodium (Na), the extracellular potassium (K) and arterial blood pressure.  It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.  It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume.  When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease.  Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart."}], "output": " Rephrased paragraph: The hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron is aldosterone.

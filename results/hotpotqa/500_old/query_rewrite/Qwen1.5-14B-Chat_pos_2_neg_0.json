Passage: The Socialist Revolutionary Party, or Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (the SRs; Russian: Партия социалистов-революционеров (ПСР), эсеры , esery) was a major political party in early 20th century Russia and a key player in the Russian Revolution.  Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms.  After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government.  In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.  The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.  The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражда́нская война́ в Росси́и , Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi ; November 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.  The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen."}], "output": "\nRephrase paragraph: The Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRs), a significant political entity during Russia's early 20th century, played a crucial role in the revolution. Initially, they coexisted with other liberal groups in the Provisional Government after the February 1917 Revolution. In the November elections, they secured the most votes for the Constituent Assembly. However, the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, gained power after the October Revolution, dissolved the assembly, and triggered the civil war. The anti-Bolshevik faction, led by Alexander Kerensky, the Right SRs, suffered a defeat at the hands of the Bolsheviks during this conflict, which took place from November 1917 to October 1922. The war involved various factions, including the Red Army, White Army, and smaller socialist and non-ideological groups. Foreign intervention also occurred. The Red Army eventually triumphed, leading to the collapse of White resistance and the establishment of Soviet control. Although the war technically ended in 1923, sporadic fighting persisted in Central Asia until 1934, resulting in an estimated 7 to 12 million casualties, making it one of Europe's most devastating conflicts."},

D1NZ is a production car drifting series in New Zealand.  There is currently no New Zealand drifting championship so D1NZ is the premier series running as a clubsport advanced event under MotorSport New Zealand.  It began early in 2003 as a small competition consisting of several drifting teams from all over the country in order to organise and regulate Drifting events on the circuit.  Since then it has continued to grow larger and more professional, now involving professional drivers with sponsored cars.  The series now includes two championships: Pro and Pro-sport.  New competitors generally need to prove themselves in the Pro-sport championship before entering the Pro championship (unless coming from an equivalent international series).

Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional? Passage: Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) , was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.  After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only.  Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional.  (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.)  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed. Conscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars).  The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.  However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed."}], "output": "\nRephrase paragraph: Rostker v. Goldberg, a 1981 Supreme Court decision, determined that the constitutional practice of drafting only men for armed forces vacancies was upheld. The law, which had previously mandated male-only registration, faced legal challenge by attorneys such as Robert L. Goldberg, arguing the gender distinction violated equal protection under the due process clause. Despite these claims, the Court ruled in favor of the law, allowing the Selective Service System to continue its practice. The Selective Service System, established in 1940, was initially implemented as a peacetime draft to fill gaps in the military that couldn't be filled through volunteering, and it remained in effect until the transition to an all-volunteer force. Currently, males aged 18 to 25 are required to register, serving as a contingency plan for potential future drafts."},

He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle.  Aonghus Mór appears to have succeeded his father in the mid part of the thirteenth century.

Passage: The Baltimore Orioles are an American professional baseball team based in Baltimore, Maryland.  The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the American League (AL) East division.  As one of the AL's original eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis, Missouri to become the St. Louis Browns.  After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney/civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. The team's current majority owner is lawyer Peter Angelos. Marcus Wayne Garland (born October 26, 1950) is a retired American right-handed pitcher who spent nine seasons from 1973 to 1981 in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Baltimore Orioles (1973–1976) and Cleveland Indians (1977–1981).  He was one of 24 ballplayers who profited from the advent of MLB free agency following the 1976 season.  A torn rotator cuff rendered his playing career into a cautionary tale of the risks of signing pitchers to free-agent contracts of seven years or longer.  The article outlined how Garland was constantly criticized by Cleveland's incompetent management for not living up to his contract (even though his decline in performance was entirely due to a serious arm injury that could not be fixed effectively by mid-1970's sports medicine) and had fans savagely booing him and even vandalizing his car during games."}], "output": "\nRephrase paragraph: The Baltimore Orioles, a founding member of the American League (AL), was established in 1901 as one of the league's original eight franchises.

It was fought by American and Filipino forces against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.

Passage: See Yourself is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3.  Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love. Within You Without You is a song written by George Harrison and released on the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after Love You To, and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September–October 1966.  Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle.  The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.  Although the song was his only composition on Sgt. Pepper, Harrison's endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover."}], "output": "\nRephrase paragraph: English musician George Harrison is recognized for the songs \"See Yourself,\" which appeared on his 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3, and \"Within You Without You,\" a track from the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt.

Passage: Anabolic steroids, also known more properly as anabolic–androgenic steroids (AAS), are steroidal androgens that include natural androgens like testosterone as well as synthetic androgens that are structurally related and have similar effects to testosterone.  They are anabolic and increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles, and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of the vocal cords and body hair.  The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, that which is thrown up, mound.  They are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. Anabolic/androgenic steroids are drugs that are obtained from the male hormone, testosterone.  Anabolic steroids are used for muscle-building and strength gain for cosmetic reasons as well as for performance-enhancement in athletics and bodybuilding.  Anabolic steroids work in many ways by increasing protein synthesis in the muscles and by eliminating the catabolic process (the process of breaking down skeletal muscle for energy).  It is common for teens and adults to use steroids as they stimulate and encourage muscle growth much more rapidly than natural body building."}], "output": "\nRephrase paragraph: Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS), which include both natural hormones like testosterone and synthetic compounds with similar effects, are widely utilized in bodybuilding.

Mohammad Yaqub Khan ceded various frontier areas to Britain while retaining full sovereignty over Afghanistan. The Second Anglo–Afghan War (Pashto: د افغان-انګرېز دويمه جګړه) was a military conflict fought between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan from 1878 to 1880, when the latter was ruled by Sher Ali Khan of the Barakzai dynasty, the son of former Emir Dost Mohammad Khan.  This was the second time British India invaded Afghanistan.  The war ended after the British emerged victorious against the Afghan rebels and the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives from the Treaty of Gandamak.  Most of the British and Indian soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan.  The Afghan tribes were permitted to maintain internal rule and local customs but they had to cede control of the area's foreign relations to the British, who, in turn, guaranteed the area's freedom from foreign military domination as a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire."}], "output": "\nRephrase paragraph: The Treaty of Gandamak symbolically marked the conclusion of the initial phase of the Second Anglo-Afghan War, which took place between 1878 and 1880.

The British Raj engaged in their second invasion of Afghanistan, ultimately securing victory against the Afghan resistance. The outcome led to the signing of the Treaty of Gandamak, which resulted in the Afghan government's surrender of certain frontier territories to Britain, while retaining nominal sovereignty. As per the treaty, most British and Indian troops withdrew, allowing Afghan tribes to retain local governance and customs but relinquishing control of foreign affairs to the British. This arrangement served as a buffer between British India and the Russian Empire, ensuring the region's neutrality from external military influence."},

Passage: Blue is the colour between violet and green on the spectrum of visible light.  Human eyes perceive blue when observing light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green.  Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres.  In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments, along with red and yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours.  Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green.  Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB colour model, used to create all the colours on the screen of a television or computer monitor. Innocent Records was a pop record label created to cater to for EMI's Virgin Records more pop oriented acts.  Following the success of the Spice Girls, Virgin Records decided to delve into the pop market.  In doing so they poached Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records (famous for steering Take That's initial flagging sales, to a multi-platinum act).  They let him launch his own Virgin Records offshoot.

It is based upon the books The Magic Bedknob; or, How to Become a Witch in Ten Easy Lessons (1943) and Bonfires and Broomsticks (1945) by English children's author Mary Norton.  The film, which combines live action and animation, stars Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson. The Age of Not Believing is a song written by Robert and Richard Sherman for the 1971 Walt Disney musical film production Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  Angela Lansbury sings the song in the motion picture.  In the lyrics, Lansbury's character Eglantine expresses how as children grow up, they lose their belief in magic and doubt themselves.  The song works on two levels, both on a personal, human level and thematically for the whole film- a Britain grown cynical from the pressures of war must learn to borrow from its own past magic in order to overcome the tremendous challenge which lies before it, while the characters in the film must finally learn to trust in Eglantine's magic to achieve their goals and save Britain from the Nazis."}], "output": "\nRephrase paragraph: The 1971 British-American fantasy film Bedknobs and Broomsticks, produced by Walt Disney Productions and distributed by Buena Vista, incorporates the song \"The Age of Not Believing.\" This musical adaptation is based on Mary Norton's books \"The Magic Bedknob\" and \"Bonfires and Broomsticks.\" Angela Lansbury and David Tomlinson star in the film, which combines live-action and animation. The song, written by the Sherman brothers, is performed by Lansbury's character, Eglantine, symbolizing the loss of childhood belief in magic and self-doubt as children grow up. The song's theme aligns with the film's plot, where both Britain, coping with war's aftermath, and the characters in the story must rediscover and trust in magic to overcome challenges and defeat the Nazis."},

Passage: Angiotensin is a peptide hormone that causes vasoconstriction and a subsequent increase in blood pressure.  It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that raises blood pressure.  Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex.  Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up. Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.  It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon.  It plays a central role in the regulation of the plasma sodium (Na), the extracellular potassium (K) and arterial blood pressure.  It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.  It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume.  When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease.  Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart."}], "output": "\nRephrase paragraph: The hormone responsible for promoting sodium retention in the distal nephron is aldosterone.

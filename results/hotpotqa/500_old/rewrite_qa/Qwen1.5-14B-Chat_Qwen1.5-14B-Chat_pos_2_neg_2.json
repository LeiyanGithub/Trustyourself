Their immense popularity, marked by Beatlemania in the 1960s, was fueled by key songwriters Lennon and McCartney, reflecting the counterculture ideals of the time. Marsha Albert, a 15-year-old girl in 1963, is credited with kickstarting Beatlemania in the US by introducing I Want to Hold Your Hand on radio, a song that became their best-selling single worldwide. This event led a record company, prompted by Albert's actions, to expedite the release of an unknown band's debut single during the holiday season, a time when new product releases were typically minimal.

It is released by the adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin, a peptide hormone involved in vasoconstriction and blood pressure regulation through the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin also stimulates aldosterone production. Aldosterone functions by targeting mineralocorticoid receptors in the nephron's distal tubules and collecting ducts, influencing sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, which in turn affects blood pressure, water balance, and blood volume. This process is counterbalanced by atrial natriuretic hormone (ANH) secreted by the heart. The sodium-chloride symporter (NCC), encoded by the SLC12A3 gene, plays a role in sodium and chloride reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule. Lastly, the loop of Henle, a segment of the nephron, contributes to creating a concentration gradient in the kidney's medulla."}], "output": "\nThe hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron is aldosterone, produced by the adrenal cortex in response to angiotensin.**"},

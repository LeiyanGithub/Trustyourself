This case clarified that while evidence of access and substantial similarity is required to prove copying, striking similarities can suggest copying even in the absence of direct evidence of access.

It is crucial for sodium retention in the distal nephron of the kidney, as well as in the salivary glands, sweat glands, and colon. Aldosterone regulates plasma sodium, extracellular potassium, and arterial blood pressure by interacting with mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron. Its actions influence sodium reabsorption, potassium excretion, water balance, blood pressure, and blood volume. Dysregulation of aldosterone can lead to cardiovascular and renal diseases. Aldosterone's function contrasts with that of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart."}], "output": "The hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron is aldosterone.**"},

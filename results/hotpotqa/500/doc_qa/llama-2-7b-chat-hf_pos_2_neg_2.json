The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers.  The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism.  It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation.  Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive. Front Row is a discontinued media center software application for Apple's Macintosh computers and Apple TV for navigating and viewing video, photos, podcasts, and music from a computer, optical disc, or the Internet through a 10-foot user interface (similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi).  The software relies on iTunes and iPhoto and is controlled by an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys.  The first version was released October 2005, with two major revisions since.  Front Row was removed and discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7.A universal remote is a remote control that can be programmed to operate various brands of one or more types of consumer electronics devices.  Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.  Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.  For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions. In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.  For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.  A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.

Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms.  After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government.  In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.  The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.  The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражда́нская война́ в Росси́и , Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi ; November 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.  The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.Communism in Russia began after Tsar Nicholas II lost his power during the February Revolution.  The Provisional Government was established under Prince Lvov, however, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the government and revolted in October 1917, taking control of Russia.  Vladmir Lenin, their leader, rose to power and governed between 1917 and 1924.  The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites.  In 1922 the Communist Reds were victorious, and formed the Soviet Union.  Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power.  He was the leader of the Communist Party until 1953.  He encouraged political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his dominance. Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov (Russian: Лавр Гео́ргиевич Корни́лов , ] ; 18 August 1870 – 13 April 1918) was a military intelligence officer, explorer, and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the ensuing Russian Civil War.  He is today best remembered for the Kornilov Affair, an unsuccessful endeavor in August/September 1917 that purported to strengthen Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government, but which led to Kerensky eventually having Kornilov arrested and charged with attempting a coup d'état, and ultimately undermined the rule of Kerensky; strengthening the claims and power of the soviets, and the Bolshevik party."}], "output": "  Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War in 1918.**"},

The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.  The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times. A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants.  These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier.  These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.  Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier."}], "output": "  The Manchester Terrier.**"},

This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty. Giuseppe Edoardo Arimondi, OSML, OMS, OCI (Savigliano, 26 April 1846 – Adwa, 1 March 1896) was an Italian general, mostly known for his role during the First Italo-Ethiopian War.  He was one of the few European commanders who gained a victory over the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, soundly defeating them at Agordat in 1893.  After a long and successfull colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. Ethiopia–Japan relations are the international relations between Ethiopia and Japan.  Both were nations with an ancient history which successfully repulsed European military advances to dominate them, Ethiopia at the Battle of Adwa, and Japan at the Battle of Tsushima, and as a result both nations considered each other potential allies prior to World War II."}], "output": "  Ethiopian sovereignty.**"},

The first track, To Know Him Is to Love Him, released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears.  Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, The First Tycoon of Teen.  The package also contained a small, round, red Back to Mono pin. To Know Him Is to Love Him is a song written by Phil Spector, inspired by words on his father's tombstone, To Know Him Was To Love Him.  It was first recorded by the only vocal group of which he was a member, the Teddy Bears.  Their recording spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in 1958, while reaching No. 2 on UK's New Musical Express chart.  Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton later had hits with the song, with its title and lyrics changed to To Know You Is to Love You.  In 1987, the song was resurrected by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris, whose Trio recording topped the U.S. country singles charts.  The song is in 12/8 time.Trash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands.  This box set is similar to the earlier Pebbles Box (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc.  Supposedly, the Trash Box collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on Pebbles, Volume 4 have been eschewed entirely.  Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the Pebbles Box.  Although most of the recordings on the Trash Box were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series.  Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit I Fought the Law (but the Law Won) by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) – which is also included in the Pebbles Box – in place of the much rarer Wine Wine Wine by Bobby Fuller that appears on Pebbles, Volume 2. Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003.  At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format.  This box set, and the companion release Rancho Texicano, were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from ZZ Top's First Album, Rio Grande Mud, and Tejas, aside from 1977's The Best of ZZ Top which features two tracks from Rio Grande Mud and one track from First Album.  Tres Hombres and Fandango!  were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes."}], "output": "  The writer of the song \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\" is Phil Spector.**"},

From its formation in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps, it has flown a variety of aircraft types including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C).  During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions.  It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities.  The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937.  It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.  The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra.  It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C Wedgetail.

The English Electric Canberra is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber that was manufactured during the 1950s.  It was developed by English Electric during the mid-to-late 1940s in response to a 1944 Air Ministry requirement for a successor to the wartime de Havilland Mosquito fast-bomber.  Amongst the performance requirements for the type was the demand for an outstanding high altitude bombing capability in addition to flying at high speeds.  These were partly accomplished by making use of newly developed jet propulsion technology.  When the Canberra was introduced to service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), the type's first operator, in May 1951, it became the service's first jet-powered bomber aircraft.The South West Pacific theatre, during World War II, was a major theatre of the war between the Allies and Japan.

Car drifting is caused when the rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle, to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering). D1NZ is a production car drifting series in New Zealand.

In the 1992 NBA draft, the Hornets selected center Alonzo Mourning out of Georgetown with the second overall pick.  With the addition of Mourning, along with second-year star Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues, the Hornets struggled around .500 for most of the season, but won 9 of their final 12 games finishing their season third in the Central Division with a 44–38 record, and qualified for their first ever playoff appearance.

The latter two were both, at the time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare films.  Cukor featured the mature actors Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard as the teenage lovers while Zeffirelli populated his film with beautiful young people, and Baz Luhrmann produced a heavily cut fast-paced version aimed at teenage audiences. Romeo Montague (Italian: Romeo Montecchi ) is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet.  The son of Montague and his wife, he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet.  Forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death."}], "output": "  Tromeo and Juliet**"},

This mission resulted in a Period of Friendship between the Spanish and the Ais native population. The Indigenous peoples of Florida lived in what is now known as Florida for more than 12,000 years before the time of first contact with Europeans.  However, the indigenous Floridians had largely died out by the early 18th century.  Some Apalachees migrated to Louisiana, where their descendants now live, some were taken to Cuba and Mexico by the Spanish in the 18th century, and a few may have been absorbed into the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes.The High Commission of Australia in London is the diplomatic mission of Australia in the United Kingdom.

A diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from one state or an organisation present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state.  In practice, a diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the embassy, which is the office of a country's diplomatic representatives in the capital city of another country, whereas consulates are diplomatic missions which are not performed in the capital of the receiving state.  As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries.

Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional? \n\n Passage: Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) , was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.  After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only.  Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional.  (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.)  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed. Conscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars).  The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.  However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed.The 2010 Kiev Victory Day Parade was held on May 9, 2010 in Kiev, honoring the 65th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in the Great Patriotic War.

The President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych delivered a jubilee address.  2,500 members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces troops from Russia and Belarus took part in the parade.  17 military orchestras took part in the parade under the command of the Chief of the Military Music Department of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Major General Volodymyr Derkach. One Rank One Pension (OROP), or same pension, for same rank, for same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement, is a longstanding demand of the Indian armed forces and veterans.  The demand for pay-pension equity, which underlies the OROP concept, was provoked by the exparte decision by the Indira Gandhi-led Indian National Congress (INC) government, in 1973, two years after the historic victory in the 1971 Bangladesh war, and shortly after Field Marshal SHFJ Manekshaw retired, to decrease armed forces pensions by 20–40 percent, and increase civilian pensions by 20 percent, without consultation with armed forces headquarters.  <ref name=V Mahalingam, 21/9> </ref>"}], "output": "  The practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was held constitutional in Rostker v.

It performs flight testing on C-130 Hercules, CV-22 Osprey, MH-53 Pave Low, UH-1 Iroquois, and HH-60 Pave Hawk aircraft. The 486th Flight Test Squadron is a secretive unit, with a somewhat misleading designation, assigned to Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, and which is associated with United States Department of State Foreign Emergency Support Team activities.  The squadron motto is Non semper ea sunt quae videntur which translates as Not always what they seem.  It was apparently assigned to the 227th Special Operations Flight, later redesignated the 150th Special Operations Squadron, McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, but is currently assigned to the 46th Test Wing at Eglin, and operates a pair of Boeing C-32B or Boeing 757-23A aircraft, on stand-by alert for special operations and intelligence missions world-wide.

He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle.  Aonghus Mór appears to have succeeded his father in the mid part of the thirteenth century.  At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown.  Aonghus Mór's first certain appearance in the historical record seems to evince his involvement in aiding native Irish kindreds against the consolidation of Anglo-Irish authority in the north-west Ireland.  Such cooperation could have been undertaken in the context of overseas kindreds like Clann Domhnaill constructing Irish alliances to gain assistance against Scottish encroachment. The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD.  The islands were known to the Norse as the Suðreyjar, or Southern Isles as distinct from the Norðreyjar or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland.  The historical record is incomplete, and the kingdom was not a continuous entity throughout the entire period.  The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, although only some of the later rulers claimed that title.  At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney.  At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory.  The islands involved have a total land area of over 8300 km2 and extend for more than 500 km from north to south.Lord of Islay was a thirteenth- and fourteenth-century title borne by the chiefs of Clann Domhnaill before they assumed the title Lord of the Isles in the late fourteenth century.  The first person regarded to have styled themself Lord of Islay is Aonghus Mór, son of the eponymous ancestor of the clan, Domhnall mac Raghnaill.  The designation of Islay was frequently used by these lords and later members of the clan. Forests in Himachal Pradesh currently cover an area of nearly 37,691 sqkm , which is about 38.3% of the total land area of the state.  The forests were once considered to be the main source of income of the state and most of the original forests were clear felled.  The emphasis has shifted, however, from exploitation to conservation.  The state government aims to increase forest cover to 50% of the total land area.  There have been various projects, including the establishment of protected areas such as National Parks, designed to preserve and expand the forests."}], "output": "  The Isles mentioned in the passage are the Kingdom of the Isles, which covers an area of over 8300 km2 and includes the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde, and the Isle of Man.

In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as Beatlemania, and as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.

The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the American League (AL) East division.  As one of the AL's original eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis, Missouri to become the St. Louis Browns.  After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney/civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. The team's current majority owner is lawyer Peter Angelos. Marcus Wayne Garland (born October 26, 1950) is a retired American right-handed pitcher who spent nine seasons from 1973 to 1981 in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Baltimore Orioles (1973–1976) and Cleveland Indians (1977–1981).  He was one of 24 ballplayers who profited from the advent of MLB free agency following the 1976 season.  A torn rotator cuff rendered his playing career into a cautionary tale of the risks of signing pitchers to free-agent contracts of seven years or longer.  The article outlined how Garland was constantly criticized by Cleveland's incompetent management for not living up to his contract (even though his decline in performance was entirely due to a serious arm injury that could not be fixed effectively by mid-1970's sports medicine) and had fans savagely booing him and even vandalizing his car during games.The Washington Senators baseball team was one of the American League's eight charter franchises.

However, the names Senators, Nationals and shorter Nats were used interchangeably by fans and media for the next sixty years; in , the latter two names were revived for the current National League franchise that had previously played in Montreal.  For a time, from 1911 to 1933, the Senators were one of the more successful franchises in Major League Baseball.  The team's rosters included Baseball Hall of Fame members Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, Joe Cronin, Bucky Harris, Heinie Manush and one of the greatest players and pitchers of all time, Walter Johnson.  But the Senators are remembered more for their many years of mediocrity and futility, including six last-place finishes in the 1940s and 1950s.  Joe Judge, Cecil Travis, Buddy Myer, Roy Sievers and Eddie Yost were other notable Senators players whose careers were spent in obscurity due to the team's lack of success. The Minnesota Twins are an American professional baseball team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and play in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's American League.

In 1905 the team changed its official name to the Washington Nationals.  The name Nationals would appear on the uniforms for only 2 seasons, and would then be replaced with the W logo for the next 52 years.  The media often shortened the nickname to Nats.  Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using the Senators nickname.  Over time, Nationals faded as a nickname, and Senators became dominant.

Its output is 6 to 10 candela, brighter than that of earlier lamps.  Its more complete combustion of the candle wick and oil than in other lamps required much less frequent trimming of the wick. The Lewis lamp is a type of light fixture used in lighthouses.  It was invented by Winslow Lewis who patented the design in 1810.  The primary marketing point of the Lewis lamp was that it used less than half the oil of the prior oil lamps which they replaced.  The lamp used a similar design to an Argand lamp, adding a parabolic reflector behind the lamp and a magnifying lens made from 4 in green bottle glass in front of the lamp.  A similar variant using a parabolic reflector was created by the inventor of the Argand lamp, Aimé Argand.  While the Argand variant became widely used by European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp design was selected by the United States for use in American lighthouses.A hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is type of cold cathode lamp used in physics and chemistry as a spectral line source (e.g. for atomic absorption spectrometers) and as a frequency tuner for light sources such as lasers.  An HCL takes advantage of the hollow cathode effect, which causes conduction at a lower voltage and with more current than a cold cathode lamp that does not have a hollow cathode. Antoine Quinquet was a French pharmacist who was born in Soissons on 9 March 1745.  In 1760 he was apprenticed to an apothecary in Soissons and in 1777 he moved to Paris where he worked for Antoine Baumé.  He travelled to Geneva, where he met Aimé Argand.

Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle.  Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's foundation.  The battle ended the almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines (1942–1945).

It was originally sung by Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, and also is featured in the Cameron Mackintosh/Disney Mary Poppins musical.  The song can be heard in the Mary Poppins scene of The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios and during the Mary Poppins segment of  at Disneyland. The Great Movie Ride was a dark ride attraction located at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Walt Disney World Resort.  The attraction employed the use of Audio-Animatronic figures, practical sets, live actors, special effects, and projections to recreate iconic scenes from twelve classic films throughout motion picture history.  The attraction—which debuted with the park on May 1, 1989—was located inside a replica of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, one of Hollywood's most famous movie palaces.I Love to Laugh, also called We Love to Laugh, is a song from Walt Disney's film Mary Poppins.  It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The song is sung in the film by Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself.  The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can lighten a mood.  (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.)  Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors down to earth again.  The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well. Step In Time is a song and dance number from Walt Disney's 1964 film Mary Poppins, and it is composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The choreography for this song was provided by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood.  It is sung by Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and the other chimney sweeps on the rooftops of London.  In the first part of the song, the lines he says in the verses are Kick your knees up, 'Round the chimney, Flap like a birdie, Up on the railing, Over the rooftops and Link your elbows followed by an interlude.  The interlude continues with Bert, Mary Poppins, Michael, Jane and all the chimney sweepers dancing around the rooftops and as Admiral Boom looks at them with the telescope, he thinks that they're Hottentots, so he orders Mr. Binnacle to make them scram with colorful fireworks.  In the second part, as all the chimney sweepers get in the house of George Banks, Mrs. Brill walks into the living room looking at them and screams, They're at it again!  and she runs away trying to strike one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan.  As Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins and Bert get in the same place, Ellen runs around the dining room with an OW!  and the chimney sweepers flip her.  The other phrases in the rest of the musical number are Votes for women, It's the master, and What's all this?"}], "output": "  Great question!

The film was co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Mayhem Pictures.  Based on the true story of a 1987 cross country team from a mainly Latino high school in McFarland, California, the film stars Kevin Costner as Jim White, the school's coach, who leads the team to win a state championship.  The film also stars Maria Bello and Morgan Saylor.

The remains, NMMNH P-18400, consist of a tibia, vertebrae, and fragments, and came from the ? late Carnian-age Upper Triassic Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation, near Fort Wingate.  Andrew Heckert, in his unpublished thesis, proposed the name Cinizasaurus hunti for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauriformes. Sphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada.  To date, three species have been described: the type species, S. goodwini, from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; S. buchholtzae, from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and S. edmontonense, from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.  The etymology of Sphaerotholus is a combination of the Greek sphaira, meaning ball, and tholos, meaning dome, and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull.  The survival of Sphaerotholus from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8 million years) and a widespread distribution.  Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.  Sphaerotholus is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur."}], "output": "  McFarland, USA came out first, in 2015. Dinosaur came out in 2000.**"},

AD 43) was a historical king of the British Catuvellauni tribe at the time of the Roman conquest.  He can probably be identified with the legendary British king Guiderius. The Catuvellauni were a Celtic tribe or state of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, attested by inscriptions into the 4th century.Romano-British culture is the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire following the Roman conquest in AD 43 and the creation of the province of Britannia.  It arose as a fusion of the imported Roman culture with that of the indigenous Britons, a people of Celtic language and custom.  It survived the 5th century Roman departure from Britain.  Scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries – approximately from AD 410 when the Roman legions withdrew, to AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived – southern Britain preserved an active sub-Roman culture that survived the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even used a vernacular Latin when writing. The history of Wales begins with the arrival of human beings in the region thousands of years ago.  Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales, or Cymru in Welsh, at least 230,000 years ago, while Homo sapiens arrived by about 31,000 BC.  However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age the region, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language.  The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79.  The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon invasion.  Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed.  The Welsh people were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples after the 11th century."}], "output": "  The Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 ruled southeastern Britain prior to conquest by the Romans.**"},

The Frisian settlers on the coast of South Jutland (today's Northern Friesland) also spoke Old Frisian but no medieval texts of this area are known.  The language of the earlier inhabitants of the region between the Zuiderzee and Ems River (the Frisians mentioned by Tacitus) is attested in only a few personal names and place-names.  Old Frisian evolved into Middle Frisian, spoken from the 16th to the 19th century. The Leda is a river in north-western Germany in the state of Lower Saxony.

Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea.

Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love. Within You Without You is a song written by George Harrison and released on the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after Love You To, and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September–October 1966.  Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle.  The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.  Although the song was his only composition on Sgt. Pepper, Harrison's endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover.Love Songs: A Compilation... Old and New is a compilation album by English musician Phil Collins.  The album was released by Atlantic Recording Corporation and Rhino Entertainment on 28 September 2004.  The album was released only a few months after the box set The Platinum Collection, which appeared earlier in the year (see 2004 in music). Sharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter.  Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy.  Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included.  Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures.  This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it.  If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views.  When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others.  You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances.  According to Gannon: How you treat others will determine how others treat you.  How others treat you will determine how you see yourself.  How you see yourself will determine who you are."}], "output": "  The English musician known for both \"See Yourself\" and \"Within You Without You\" is George Harrison.**"},

In addition to their time in Iceland, he returns with them to Canada and captures their reactions of the Islendingadagurinn celebrated each year at Gimli.

The case resulted in the parties reaching a settlement.  Settlement checks in the amount of $15.00 were distributed to class members beginning November 17, 2016. A liability insurance company's duty to settle is defined as an implied obligation to by the insurer to a policyholder and to a claimant to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.  To the surprise of many, a typical liability insurance policy makes no express contractual promise to settle.  In California, an insurer, who wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits.  A rationale for this duty is that [w]hen an offer is made to settle a claim in excess of policy limits for an amount within policy limits, a genuine and immediate conflict of interest arises between carrier and assured.  An insurer who denies coverage does so at its own risk.  Such factors as a belief that the policy does not provide coverage, should not affect a decision as to whether the settlement offer in question is a reasonable one.  It is the duty of the insurer to keep the insured informed of settlement offers.  [A]n insurer potentially can be liable for unreasonably coercing an insured to contribute to a settlement fund."}], "output": " $10.5 million**"},

The 1999 Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25 October, though its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days prior.  The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day.  Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28 October before peaking with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a record-low pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg).  The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29 October.  The cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, remaining quasi-stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system; the storm dissipated on 1 November over the Bay of Bengal. Kathantara (Odia: କଥାନ୍ତର , English Another Story) is a 2007 Indian Oriya language disaster film directed by Himansu Khatua, a story of tribulations of the 1999 Odisha cyclone.Severe Tropical Cyclone Donna was the strongest off-season South Pacific tropical cyclone on record during the month of May.  The twenty-first tropical disturbance, third named storm, and second severe tropical cyclone of the annual cyclone season, Donna formed from an area of disturbed weather that was first monitored west-northwest of Fiji on 1 May 2017.  The disturbance drifted eastward amid an increasingly favorable environment, and it was designated Tropical Depression 21F late on 2 May.  Twelve hours later, it intensified into a Category 1 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and was designated Tropical Cyclone Donna as the storm's motion shifted west and then south.  After reaching its initial peak as a Category 4 cyclone early on 6 May, the effects of wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken.  However, it reintensified into a Category 5 cyclone on 8 May.  Soon after, Donna entered a region of strong westerly flow and began to rapidly weaken.  Continuing to accelerate in a southerly direction, Donna eventually weakened into a tropical low on 10 May.  By 16 May, Donna's remnants had fully dissipated. Severe Tropical Cyclone Anne was one of the most intense tropical cyclones within the South Pacific basin during the 1980s.  The cyclone was first noted on January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the North-Western Pacific basin.  Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward.  Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8.  The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major tropical cyclone to affect Vanuatu within four years.  On January 11, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category 4 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.  After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory.  The system subsequently weakened as it started to interact with Tropical Cyclone Agi.  Anne weakened into a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia."}], "output": "  Great!

These things are a form of property or right to possession or ownership of an object.  The law orders or prioritises rights and classifies property as either real and tangible, such as land, or intangible, such as the right of an author to their literary works or personal but tangible, such as a book or a pencil.  The scope of what constitutes a thing capable of being classified as property and when an individual or body corporate gains priority of interest over a thing has in legal scholarship been heavily debated on a philosophical level.

The name honours Italian naturalist Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (1656–1730). Brabejum is a genus of a single species of large evergreen tree, Brabejum stellatifolium in the Proteaceae, commonly called wild almond, bitter almond or ghoeboontjie.  It is restricted in the wild to South Africa's Western Cape Province, where it grows in thickets along the banks of streams.  The plant is of botanical interest as being Africa's only member of the large grevilleoid subfamily.  It is a bushy small tree with branches widely at ground level and numerous erect vigorous stems.  Leaves to 6 in (15 cm) long, narrow and bluntly toothed, appear at intervals along the branches, mostly in whorls of 6.  In summer, the plant bears white flowers densely crowded on spikes arising from rusty buds at the leaf axils.  The fruits to 2 in (5 cm) long, magenta to reddish brown, similar to an almond, appear in autumn.  The nut is too bitter to eat; however, in earlier times it was boiled, roasted, and ground to make a coffee drink.Sinocyclocheilus is a genus of freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae endemic to China, where only found in Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan.  Almost all of its species live in or around caves and most of these have adaptions typical of cavefish such as a lack of scales, lack of pigmentation and reduced eyes (some are completely blind).  Several species have an unusual hunchbacked appearance and some of the cave-dwellers have a horn on the back (above the forehead), the function of which is unclear.  In contrast, the Sinocyclocheilus species that live aboveground, as well as a few found underground, show no clear cavefish adaptions.  They are relatively small fish reaching up to 23 cm in length.  The individual species have small ranges and populations, leading to the status of most of the evaluated species as threatened.  Many species populations in the genus have yet to be evaluated. Myiodynastes is a genus of birds in the family Tyrannidae.  Created by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1857, the genus contains five species which are collectively referred to as sulphur-bellied flycatchers; that name is also given to one of the individual species in the genus.  The genus name Myiodynastes is a compound word composed from two Greek words: muia, meaning fly and dunastẽs, meaning ruler."}], "output": "  According to the passage, the genus of more individual species of plants is Marsilea, with approximately 65 species."},

Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 US 131 (1948) (also known as the Hollywood Antitrust Case of 1948, the Paramount Case, the Paramount Decision or the Paramount Decree) was a landmark United States Supreme Court antitrust case that decided the fate of movie studios owning their own theatres and holding exclusivity rights on which theatres would show their films.  It would also change the way Hollywood movies were produced, distributed, and exhibited.  The Court held in this case that the existing distribution scheme was in violation of the antitrust laws of the United States, which prohibit certain exclusive dealing arrangements. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976) , was the first case in which a majority of the United States Supreme Court determined that statutory or administrative sex classifications were subject to intermediate scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.Block booking is a system of selling multiple films to a theater as a unit.  Block booking was the prevailing practice among Hollywood's major studios from the turn of the 1930s until it was outlawed by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. (1948).  Under block booking, independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of [a] studio's pictures sight unseen.  Those studios could then parcel out second-rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical.  The element of the system involving the purchase of unseen pictures is known as blind bidding. Richard John Baker v. Gerald R. Nelson, 291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971) is a case in which the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a state law limiting marriage to persons of the opposite sex did not violate the U.S. Constitution.  Baker appealed, and on October 10, 1972, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the appeal for want of a substantial federal question.  Because the case came to the U.S. Supreme Court through mandatory appellate review (not certiorari), the dismissal constituted a decision on the merits and established Baker v. Nelson as precedent, though the extent of its precedential effect had been subject to debate.  In May 2013, Minnesota legalized same-sex marriage and it took effect on August 1, 2013.  Subsequently, on June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly overruled Baker in Obergefell v. Hodges making same-sex marriage legal nationwide."}], "output": "  United States v.

The plot focuses on a prank caller who, posing as a police officer, convinces the manager of a fast food restaurant to carry out intrusive and unlawful procedures on an employee.  The film is based on the strip search prank call scam that took place at a Mount Washington, Kentucky McDonald's restaurant in Bullit County.  Dowd's performance as Sandra, the manager, won her the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress. The strip search phone call scam is a series of incidents that extended over a period of about ten years before an arrest was made in 2004.  The incidents involved a man prank calling a restaurant or grocery store, claiming to be a police officer and then convincing managers to conduct strip searches of female employees, and to perform other bizarre acts on behalf of the police.  The calls were most often placed to fast-food restaurants in small towns, located in rural areas of the United States.Devyani Khobragade is an Indian Foreign Service officer.

Along with the sitar, it is among the most popular and prominent instruments in Hindustani classical music.  The sarod is known for a deep, weighty, introspective sound, in contrast with the sweet, overtone-rich texture of the sitar, with sympathetic strings that give it a resonant, reverberant quality.

The sousaphone ( ), is a brass instrument in the same family as the more widely known tuba.  Created around 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa (whom the instrument was then named after), it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching, as well as to carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band.  Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or buzz into a large cupped mouthpiece.  Unlike the tuba, the instrument is bent in a circle to fit around the body of the musician; it ends in a large, flaring bell that is pointed forward, projecting the sound ahead of the player.  Because of the ease of carrying and the direction of sound, it is widely employed in marching bands, as well as various other musical genres.  Sousaphones were originally made out of brass but in the mid-20th century started to be made from lighter materials like fiberglass; today both types are in wide use."}], "output": "  Sarod**."},

Chrysalis: A Magazine of Women's Culture was a feminist publication produced from 1977 to 1980.  The self-published magazine was founded by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie at the Woman's Building in downtown Los Angeles.  Chysalis grew from Grimstad and Rennie's editorial work on the self-help resource books, The New Woman's Survival Catalog and The New Woman's Survival Sourcebook.  Chrysalis distinguished itself from other feminist publications through an organic integration of politics, literature, cultural studies, and art.  The magazine was produced through a collective process that grew out of the feminist practice of consciousness-raising.  Unusually broad in scope, Chrysalis did not substitute breadth for quality.

Thomas Loren Friedman (born July 20, 1953) is an American journalist and author.  He is a three time Pulitzer Prize winner.Introduction to Metaphysics (French: Introduction à la Métaphysique) is a 1903 essay about the concept of reality by Henri Bergson.  For Bergson, reality occurs not in a series of discrete states but as a process similar to that described by process philosophy or the Greek philosopher Heraclitus.  Reality is fluid and cannot be completely understood through reductionistic analysis, which he said implies that we go around an object, gaining knowledge from various perspectives which are relative.  Instead, reality can be grasped absolutely only through intuition, which Bergson expressed as entering into the object. Duration (French: la durée) is a theory of time and consciousness posited by the French philosopher Henri Bergson.  Bergson sought to improve upon inadequacies he perceived in the philosophy of Herbert Spencer, due, he believed, to Spencer's lack of comprehension of mechanics, which led Bergson to the conclusion that time eluded mathematics and science.  Bergson became aware that the moment one attempted to measure a moment, it would be gone: one measures an immobile, complete line, whereas time is mobile and incomplete.  For the individual, time may speed up or slow down, whereas, for science, it would remain the same.  Hence Bergson decided to explore the inner life of man, which is a kind of duration, neither a unity nor a quantitative multiplicity.  Duration is ineffable and can only be shown indirectly through images that can never reveal a complete picture.  It can only be grasped through a simple intuition of the imagination."}], "output": "  Based on the provided passage, the answer to the question is: Henri Bergson.

Under a declaration made in Privy Council in 1960, the name Mountbatten-Windsor applies to male-line descendants of the Queen without royal styles and titles.  Individuals with royal styles do not usually use a surname, but some descendants of the Queen with royal styles have used Mountbatten-Windsor when a surname was required. The Mountbatten family is a European dynasty originating as a branch of the German princely Battenberg family.  The name was adopted during World War I by family members residing in the United Kingdom due to rising anti-German sentiment amongst the British public.  The name is an Anglicisation of the German Battenberg, a small town in Hesse.  The title of count of Battenberg, later prince of Battenberg, was granted to a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, itself a cadet branch of the House of Hesse, in the mid 19th century.The Zulu royal family consists of the reigning monarch of the Zulus of South Africa, King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, his consorts, legitimate descendants, near relatives and male-line descendants of his great-grandfather, King Mpande who, as a half-brother of the Zulu Pater Patriae, King Shaka, reigned from 1840 to 1872.  Shaka's policies and conquests transformed a small clan into one of South Africa's most influential pre-colonial realms, extending over much of what is now KwaZulu-Natal. In history and heraldry, a cadet branch consists of the male-line descendants of a monarch or patriarch's younger sons (cadets).  In the ruling dynasties and noble families of much of Europe and Asia, the family's major assets—realm, titles, fiefs, property and income—have historically been passed from a father to his firstborn son in what is known as primogeniture; younger sons—cadets—inherited less wealth and authority to pass to future generations of descendants."}], "output": "  The Mountbatten-Windsor family is a European dynasty.**"},

In a career spanning over 50 years, Vonnegut published 14 novels, three short story collections, five plays, and five works of non-fiction.  He is most famous for his darkly satirical, best-selling novel Slaughterhouse-Five (1969). Armageddon in Retrospect is a collection of short stories and essays about war and peace written by Kurt Vonnegut.  It is the first posthumous collection of his previously unpublished writings.  The book includes an introduction by Mark Vonnegut, a letter from Kurt to his family about his experiences as an American prisoner of war in Nazi Germany, and the fire-bombing of Dresden.  Like many of Vonnegut's other books, Armageddon in Retrospect is laden with handwritten quotations and rough drawings by the author.José María Gironella Pous (31 December 1917 in Darnius – 3 January 2003 in Arenys de Mar) was a Spanish author best known for his fictional work The Cypresses Believe in God (Los cipreses creen en Dios), which was published in Spain in 1953 and translated into English by Harriet de Onís in 1955.  The book is a novel in two parts, and is the first novel of four, written from a Roman Catholic viewpoint, by its Catholic author, who had been educated in a seminary — but whose approach is notable for its even-handedness and fair assessment of the many nuances and subtleties among all factions on the eve of war.  The story is set in Girona, a city in eastern Catalonia, and follows the life of a family, from 1931 until the Spanish Civil War breaks out in 1936.  The protagonist is the son of an atheist from Madrid, who is married to a devout Basque woman, and has a younger brother and sister also caught up in the conflict.  In a sequel to Cypresses, One Million Dead (Un millón de muertos), translated by Joan MacLean, Gironella follows the Alvear family through the war.  The next novel is Peace after War, published in English in 1969, and was also translated by MacLean.  The fourth novel, Los hombres lloran solos (Men cry alone), has not been translated and published in English. Little Big Man is a 1964 novel by American author Thomas Berger.  Often described as a satire or parody of the western genre, the book is a modern example of picaresque fiction.  Berger made use of a large volume of overlooked first-person primary materials, such as diaries, letters, and memoirs, to fashion a wide-ranging and entertaining tale that comments on alienation, identity, and perceptions of reality.  Easily Berger's best known work, Little Big Man was made into a popular film by Arthur Penn.  It has been called Berger's response to the great American myth of the frontier, representing as it does most of the central traditions of American literature."}], "output": "  Sure!

It comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Mide, Osraige and Leinster.  Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic fifths of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster.  The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes.  In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties. Patrick Kennedy (early 1801 – 29 March 1873) was a folklorist from Co.  Wexford, Ireland.

They are anabolic and increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles, and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of the vocal cords and body hair.  The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, that which is thrown up, mound.  They are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. Anabolic/androgenic steroids are drugs that are obtained from the male hormone, testosterone.  Anabolic steroids are used for muscle-building and strength gain for cosmetic reasons as well as for performance-enhancement in athletics and bodybuilding.  Anabolic steroids work in many ways by increasing protein synthesis in the muscles and by eliminating the catabolic process (the process of breaking down skeletal muscle for energy).  It is common for teens and adults to use steroids as they stimulate and encourage muscle growth much more rapidly than natural body building.Docking is the intentional removal of part of an animal's tail or, sometimes, ears.  The term cropping is more commonly used in reference to the cropping of ears, while docking more commonly—but not exclusively—refers to the tail.  The term tailing is also commonly used.  The term arises because the living flesh of the tail, from which the animal's tail hairs grow, commonly is known as the dock. Tensile testing, also known as tension testing, is a fundamental materials science test in which a sample is subjected to a controlled tension until failure.  The results from the test are commonly used to select a material for an application, for quality control, and to predict how a material will react under normal forces. Properties that are directly measured via a tensile test are ultimate tensile strength, maximum elongation and reduction in area.  From these measurements the following properties can also be determined: Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, and strain-hardening characteristics.  Uniaxial tensile testing is the most commonly used for obtaining the mechanical characteristics of isotropic materials.  For anisotropic materials, such as composite materials and textiles, biaxial tensile testing is required."}], "output": "  Anabolic steroids.**"},

Today, Peterhouse has 226 undergraduates, 86 full-time graduate students and 45 fellows.  The modern name of Peterhouse does not include the word college. From a clerical family (Samuel Harland, general secretary of the Commonwealth and Continental Church Society, was his father), Harland was educated at The Dragon School in Oxford and Haileybury.  He then went to university at Peterhouse, Cambridge, taking a law degree.

It is the oldest college in the Erstwhile state of Travancore and Madras Presidency.  Wikipedia says: The Maharaja had occasion to visit a school that was imparting instruction in English at Nagarcoil under the auspices of the London Missionary Society (LMS).  He was impressed by the school and the quality of the education given there and was convinced that the new type of school held out great prospects for the people of the state.  The school later evolved into Scott Christian College, Nagercoil.  Shortly thereafter he invited Mr. Roberts who was in-charge of the school at Nagarcoil to come to Thiruvananthapuram and start a similar school there.  The educationist, who was an Englishman, agreed and a new school was started in 1834.  The school started by Mr. Roberts has now blossomed into the University College, Thiruvananthapuram.  So Scott Christian College is also linked to University college, and both are now reputed colleges.  The alumni of the college are called Scottians.

Another objective of the game is to teach players some of the fundamentals of economics, and the ways in which the economy and the government interact.  Different editions were published for several different countries.  The name Poleconomy is a portmanteau of politics and economy.Pashmina is a fine type of cashmere wool.

It is named after George Wythe, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and mentor to Thomas Jefferson.  Wytheville's population was 8,211 at the 2010 census.  Located at the intersection of Interstate Highways 77 and 81, the town has long been a crossroads for travelers.  During the American Civil War, Wytheville had a strategic importance, and was attacked in 1863 (Toland's Raid) and 1865 (Stoneman's 1865 Raid).  The town is also the birthplace of Edith Bolling Wilson, wife of President Woodrow Wilson. Interstate 81 (I-81) is an 855 mi highway.  In the U.S. state of Virginia, I-81 runs for 324.92 mi , making the portion in Virginia longer than any other state's portion.  It is also the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia.  It stretches from the Tennessee state line near Bristol to the West Virginia state line near Winchester.Interstate 40 (I-40) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from Barstow, California to Wilmington, North Carolina.  In North Carolina, I-40 enters the state along the Pigeon River Gorge, from Tennessee.  Crossing the entire state, it connects the cities of Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Durham and Raleigh before ending along U.S. Highway 117/North Carolina Highway 132 (US 117/NC 132) in Wilmington.  The landscapes traversed by I-40 include the Blue Ridge Mountains, foothills of western North Carolina, suburban communities, the urban core of several Piedmont cities, along with eastern North Carolina farmland.  At a total of 423.55 mi , it is the longest interstate highway in North Carolina.  There are five auxiliary Interstates in the state related to I-40, as well as one business loop which currently runs through Winston-Salem.  The route is labeled east-west for the entire route (as are all even-numbered Interstate highways), however the eastern portion (from Hillsboro to Wilmington) follows a much more north-south alignment. There are 32 Interstate Highways—9 main routes and 23 auxiliary routes—that exist entirely or partially in the U.S. state of New York.  In New York, Interstate Highways are mostly maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), with some exceptions.  Unlike in some other states, Interstate Highways in New York are not directly referenced by NYSDOT with their number; instead, the letter I is suffixed to the number of the route on reference markers and in internal documents.  On the surface, there appears to be numerical duplication between several Interstate Highways and state routes—such as I-86 (I-86) and NY 86—but the I suffix that is appended to Interstate Highway numbers allows the Interstate Highway and state route to co-exist (86I versus 86, respectively)."}], "output": ""},

Mohammad Yaqub Khan ceded various frontier areas to Britain while retaining full sovereignty over Afghanistan. The Second Anglo–Afghan War (Pashto: د افغان-انګرېز دويمه جګړه) was a military conflict fought between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan from 1878 to 1880, when the latter was ruled by Sher Ali Khan of the Barakzai dynasty, the son of former Emir Dost Mohammad Khan.  This was the second time British India invaded Afghanistan.  The war ended after the British emerged victorious against the Afghan rebels and the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives from the Treaty of Gandamak.  Most of the British and Indian soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan.  The Afghan tribes were permitted to maintain internal rule and local customs but they had to cede control of the area's foreign relations to the British, who, in turn, guaranteed the area's freedom from foreign military domination as a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire.The Emirate of Afghanistan (Pashto: د افغانستان امارت‎ Da Afghānistān Amārat ) was an emirate between Central Asia and South Asia, which is today's Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.  The emirate emerged from the Durrani Empire, when Dost Mohammed Khan, the founder of the Barakzai dynasty in Kabul, prevailed.  The history of the Emirate was dominated by 'the Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia.  This period was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in South Asia.  The Emirate of Afghanistan continued the war with the Sikh Empire, which led to the invasion of Afghanistan by British-led Indian forces who completely wiped out the Afghans in 1842 but did not fulfil their initial war objectives.  However, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again defeated the Afghans and this time the British took control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed following the Third Anglo-Afghan War.

A former mill town, Bolton has been a production centre for textiles since Flemish weavers settled in the area in the 14th century, introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition.  The urbanisation and development of the town largely coincided with the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution.  Bolton was a 19th-century boomtown, and at its zenith in 1929 its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world.  The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War, and by the 1980s cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in Bolton. Rivington Hall Barn adjoins Rivington Hall in Rivington, Lancashire, near Chorley and Bolton.  The barn may date from between the 9th and 13th centuries, but more likely the 16th century, and was restored, altered and enlarged in 1905 by Jonathan Simpson for Lord Leverhulme.  It is a Grade II Listed building.The Manor of Rivington was a manorial estate in Rivington, Lancashire, England that possibly predates the Domesday survey.  Before 1212 the Pilkington family owned six oxgangs of land.  Over time it became separated in moieties and by the 16th century the Pilkingtons of Rivington Hall owned a 5/8 share.  In 1605 the Lathoms of Irlam owned a quarter share and the Shaws 1/8.

These engines may be based on a number of thermodynamic cycles encompassing both open cycle devices such as those of Sir George Cayley and John Ericsson and the closed cycle engine of Robert Stirling.  Hot air engines are distinct from the better known internal combustion based engine and steam engine. Sir George Cayley, 6th Baronet (27 December 1773 – 15 December 1857) was a prolific English engineer and is one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics.  Many consider him to be the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of flight.Elliott J. Stoddard invented and patented two versions of the Stoddard engine, the first in 1919 and the second in 1933.  The general engine classification is an external combustion engine with valves and single-phase gaseous working fluid (i.e. a hot air engine).  The internal working fluid was originally air, although in modern versions, other gases such as helium or hydrogen may be used. Charles Stephen Boreham (19 December 1857 – 15 May 1925) was a New Zealand shearer and trade unionist.  He was born in Richmond, Tasmania, Australia on 19 December 1857."}], "output": ""},

A basset hound declares that she's a TV star (a reference to Cleo the Dog, from the contemporary TV sitcom The People's Choice), we learn the unusual breed of a Newfoundland puppy's grandfather, and a great dane named Victor Barky plays the piano.

The collection was published in 1928.  The article argues that it is no coincidence that some of the greatest works of world literature - including Oedipus Rex, Hamlet, as well as The Brothers Karamazov – all concern parricide, which in Dostoevsky's case Freud links to his epilepsy. Oedipus Rex, also known by its Greek title, Oedipus Tyrannus (Ancient Greek: Οἰδίπους Τύραννος IPA: [oidípuːs týranːos]), or Oedipus the King, is an Athenian tragedy by Sophocles that was first performed around 429 BC.  Originally, to the ancient Greeks, the title was simply Oedipus (Οἰδίπους), as it is referred to by Aristotle in the Poetics.  It is thought to have been renamed Oedipus Tyrannus to distinguish it from Oedipus at Colonus.  In antiquity, the term “tyrant” referred to a ruler, but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation.The Interpretation of Dreams (German: Die Traumdeutung ) is a 1899 book by psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, in which the author introduces his theory of the unconscious with respect to dream interpretation, and discusses what would later become the theory of the Oedipus complex.  Freud revised the book at least eight times and, in the third edition, added an extensive section which treated dream symbolism very literally, following the influence of Wilhelm Stekel.  Freud said of this work, Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime. Freud: A Life for Our Time is a 1988 biography of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, by the historian Peter Gay.  The work is based partly on new material that has become available since the publication of Ernest Jones' The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1953).  The book has been praised, but has also been criticized by several authors skeptical of psychoanalysis."}], "output": ""},

Admired for her spontaneity, expressiveness, and clear diction, she was considered one of the greatest interpreters of 20th century Catalan, Spanish and Latin American art song.  She premiered many works in that genre, including those by Enrique Granados, Manuel de Falla, Frederic Mompou, Alberto Ginastera, and Enric Morera, several of which had been specially written for her voice.  The main part of the collection of Badia's sound recordings, scores, letters and pictures is preserved in the Biblioteca de Catalunya.

Enrique Echeverría Vázquez (19231972) was a Mexican painter, part of the Generación de la Ruptura and early member of the Salón de la Plástica Mexicana.  He was one of a number of painters who broke away from the established painting figurative style in Mexico in the mid 20th century to experiment with abstractionism and other modern movements in painting from Europe.  Although his career was followed by other artists and critics, he died in the early 1970s when painters of his generation were only beginning to receive widespread recognition for their work.  While meriting two major exhibits at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, one just after his death and a retrospective thirty years later in 2003, he and his work are not well known among younger Mexican painters."}], "output": ""},

Selle v. Gibb, 741 F.2d 896 (7th Cir.  1984) was a landmark ruling on the doctrine of striking similarities.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that while copying must be proved by access and substantial similarity, where evidence of access does not exist, striking similarities may raise an inference of copying by showing that the work could not have been the result of independent creation, coincidence, or common source.  Striking similarity alone is not enough to infer access.  The similarity must preclude independent creation in order to infer access.West v. Barnes, 2 U.S. 401 (1791), was the first United States Supreme Court decision and the earliest case calling for oral argument.  Van Staphorst v. Maryland (1791) was docketed prior to West v.

The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera, in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s, the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season.  The owners of the theatre, usually noble amateurs, charged the impresario with hiring a composer (until the 1850s operas were expected to be new) and the orchestra, singers, costumes and sets, all while assuming considerable financial risk.  In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce Der Schauspieldirektor (The Impresario).  Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice, where his opera Orlando finto pazzo was followed by numerous others.

Before joining the Met Orchestra, he was a frequent performer with the New York Philharmonic for fourteen seasons, and participated in many concerts, recordings and tours in the US, Europe, Asia, Australia and South America.  He was also a member of the Boehm Quintette for many years, and premiered many works composed for that ensemble.  As soloist, he has appeared with the Orchestra of St. Luke’s in Carnegie Hall including performing as soloist in the American premier of Benjamin Britten’s “Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal”, as well as at many festivals.  He holds degrees from The Juilliard School, where he was a student of Ranier DeIntinis.  Mr. Anderer is active in the recording studio, performing chamber music, operas, symphonic works, solo works, TV commercials and films along with performing in recitals with singers and other musicians.

A freight forwarder, forwarder, or forwarding agent, also known as a non-vessel operating common carrier (NVOCC), is a person or company that organizes shipments for individuals or corporations to get goods from the manufacturer or producer to a market, customer or final point of distribution.  Forwarders contract with a carrier or often multiple carriers to move the goods.  A forwarder does not move the goods but acts as an expert in the logistics network.  These carriers can use a variety of shipping modes, including ships, airplanes, trucks, and railroads, and often multiple modes for a single shipment.  For example, the freight forwarder may arrange to have cargo moved from a plant to an airport by truck, flown to the destination city, then moved from the airport to a customer's building by another truck."}], "output": ""},

Known commonly in North America as andromedas or fetterbushes, they are broad-leaved evergreen shrubs growing to 1 - tall and 3 - wide.  The leaves are spirally arranged, often appearing to be in whorls at the end of each shoot with bare stretches of shoot below; they are lanceolate-ovate, 2 - long and 1.0 - broad, leathery textured, and with an entire or serrated margin.  The young leaves in spring are typically brightly coloured.  The flowers are bell-shaped, 5 - long, white or pink, and arranged in racemes 5 - long.  The fruit is a woody capsule which splits into five sections to release the numerous small seeds. Phlebodium is a small genus of two to four species of ferns, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.  The genus is closely related to Polypodium, and the species were formerly included in that genus.Sinopieris is a genus of butterflies in the family Pieridae.  The genus occurs in Nepal, Tibet, Yunnan, Gansu, Shaanxi and Sichuan.  All six species were originally included in Pieris.

Most Sinopieris species have a suffused grey or blackish post-discal band whereas Pieris usually have a single (males) or a pair (females) of blackish post-discal spots on the forewings, and no trace of any spot or band on the hindwings. The andromeda lace bug (Stephanitis takeyai) is a pest insect on plants of the genus Pieris, especially Pieris japonica, the Japanese andromeda.  It originated in Japan with its host plant but has since been introduced to other areas of the globe.  At least one Pieris species, Pieris floribunda, is resistant to the bug."}], "output": ""},

The bridge was built in 1889 to a design by Charles A. Allen, at the time a civil engineer for the city of Worcester.  The bridge was built to replace an older wooden span at the request of Edwin Bartlett, the owner of textile mills in North Oxford, whose businesses and employees would have used the road.  The bridge is 30 ft long and 42 ft wide, with its elliptical arch reaching a height of 13 ft above the river.  The facing of the bridge is rough-cut granite that has been fixed with mortar.  In contrast, the granite stones that make up the arch have been very precisely worked.  The bridge has parapet walls made of large granite slabs 4.5 ft , 2 ft wide, and 1 ft thick. Worcester ( , ] ) is a city and the county seat of Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States.  Named after Worcester, England, as of the 2010 Census the city's population was 181,045, making it the second most populous city in New England after Boston.  Worcester is located approximately 40 mi west of Boston, 50 mi east of Springfield and 40 mi north of Providence.  Due to its location in Central Massachusetts, Worcester is known as the Heart of the Commonwealth, thus, a heart is the official symbol of the city.  However, the heart symbol may also have its provenance in lore that the mass-produced Valentine's Day card was invented in the city.The Sutliff Bridge is a bridge over the Cedar River at Sutliff, a Johnson County community near Lisbon, Iowa, United States.  A Parker truss bridge, it was built in 1897 and 1898 at a cost of approximately $12,000.  J.R. Sheely was the engineer for the original Sutliff Bridge.  After a modern replacement was built over the Cedar in 1983, the bridge was slated for destruction, but it was ultimately saved, and on May 15, 1998, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  Although the bridge remained a celebrated location for locals and for visitors from across Iowa, including a 5k foot race beloved as the “worst road race in America, it succumbed to massive floods in the second week of June 2008: while the river normally flowed many feet below the bottom of the bridge, the floods topped the bridge's deck, and one of the bridge's spans was washed away on June 13 as the surrounding countryside was inundated with vast amounts of water.  It is estimated that restoring the bridge will cost $1.7 million.  Most of this money would come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with the rest coming from donations and local governments; both FEMA and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed in principle to repair the bridge.  The bridge reconstruction was supervised by VJ Engineering of Coralville, Iowa and construction was completed by Iowa Bridge and Culvert of Washington, Iowa.  In October 2012 a ribbon cutting ceremony was held opening the bridge to public use for the first time in four years. The Gardnerville Branch Jail is a historic jail located at 1440 Courthouse St. in Gardnerville, Nevada.  The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915.  Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary.  As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail.  However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself.  Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail.  The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him.  Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail."}], "output": ""},

He gained prominence for a series of novels known as the Empire Trilogy (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), which deal with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. Louis Aragon (] , 3 October 1897 – 24 December 1982) was a French poet, who was one of the leading voices of the surrealist movement in France, who co-founded with André Breton and Philippe Soupault the surrealist review Littérature.  He was also a novelist and editor, a long-time member of the Communist Party and a member of the Académie Goncourt.The Murree Rebellion of 1857, sometimes termed a war of Independence, was part of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.  It was a rebel skirmish between the tribes surrounding the Hill Station of Murree (in modern-day Pakistan) and the colonial government of British India.  Resentment toward colonial rule had been mounting for many years following the British establishment in the subcontinent.  There had been occasional isolated uprisings toward the British.  The significance of the 1857 events was that, although not centrally coordinated, the uprisings had the feel of something much larger with real anticipation that colonial rule would be overthrown. According to the Republic of Niger's Constitution of 1999, most human rights, as defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are upheld and protected.  Despite these protections, concerns of both domestic and international human rights organizations have been raised over the behavior of the government, military, police forces, and over the continuation of traditional practices which contravene the 1999 constitution.  Under French colonial rule (1900–1960) and from independence until 1992, citizens of Niger had few political rights, and lived under arbitrary government power.  Although the situation has improved since the return to civilian rule, criticisms remain over the state of human rights in the country."}], "output": ""},

The series features a species of nocturnal creatures known as gargoyles that turn to stone during the day.  After spending a thousand years in an enchantedly petrified state, the gargoyles (who have been transported from medieval Scotland) are reawakened in modern-day New York City, and take on roles as the city's secret night-time protectors. Gargoyles the Movie: The Heroes Awaken is a direct-to-video animated film from The Walt Disney Company.  The film is actually the five-episode pilot (Awakening) of the animated television series Gargoyles edited into one long feature film, approximately 100 minutes in length.  As a result, numerous scenes from the original broadcast episodes were cut due to time constraints.  In addition, a number of scenes were also moved around and some dialogues were changed.  The episodes were produced and aired in 1994, and the film was released to laserdisc and VHS in February 1995 and featured an interactive VHS/LD board game.  As the pilot episodes have been released to DVD as part of Gargoyles: Season 1, this feature is unlikely to be released independently again.Desert kites are constructions aimed at trapping game animals, found in the Middle East.  Known to the local Bedouin as the Works of the Old Men, are found across the deserts of Syria, Jordan, Southern Israel and Saudi Arabia.  They are believed to have been used for hunting wild animals and consist of long dry-stone walls converging on a neck which opens into a confined space which was used as the killing floor.  The length of the walls can run to hundreds of metres and can be best seen from the air.  They were given their name by pilots who first saw them from the air in the 1920s.  Almost 2,000 have been identified across Jordan and Syria.  No research has been done across the Saudi Arabian Desert.  Modern research has proven that the desert kites were mainly used for hunting herds of migrating goitered or Persian gazelle, a species which became extinct in Southern Levant during the 19th century.  Most desert kites have been dated through scientific methods to be between 3 and 5 thousand years old.  The claim of older ages (8 to 9 thousand years) has been contradicted by more recent studies.  Younger dates mean that the mass hunting did not occur in prehistory and was not done by hunter-gatherers, but during a later period, by agriculturalists who were already growing most of their food.  Rock art in the vicinity of some of the kites indicates that the hunt could represent a large social effort, done together by people from several settlements, and showing religious connotations. The 2000 Race of a Thousand Years was an endurance race and the final round of the 2000 American Le Mans Series.  It was run on the Adelaide Street Circuit in Australia on New Year's Eve, 31 December 2000.

The name of the event stems from most matches being contested under hardcore wrestling regulations; the defunct Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion originally used the term to describe the regulations for all of its matches.  The event name was established in 2009; however, its theme began with its predecessor, One Night Stand, which was promoted in 2005 and 2006 as an ECW reunion show.  In 2007, WWE promoted the show as one of its own regular PPV events but kept the ECW concept of Extreme Rules matches.  In 2009, WWE renamed the One Night Stand event to WWE Extreme Rules.  The 2009 Extreme Rules event was noted by WWE to be a direct continuation of the One Night Stand chronology.  However, the 2010 event was later promoted as only the second event under a new chronology, one that is no longer a direct continuation of the One Night Stand events.  Starting in 2010, Extreme Rules was moved from June to late April/early May to replace Backlash as the post-WrestleMania pay-per-view event.  For 2013, the event was scheduled to take place in mid-May and replace Over the Limit, which was moved to October before being discontinued later that year and replaced by Battleground.  The event will return to the early June slot of WWE's pay-per-view calendar and will be a Raw-exclusive pay-per-view event.

Work flow functionality was not new.  Lotus Notes was the pioneer of workflow systems until it went out of favor in early 2000.  From the designs of Lotus Notes, Mr. Charles combined the idea into ERP systems and created Radix WRP, a new class of ERP system with workflow manageability. An NTFS symbolic link (symlink) is a filesystem object in the NTFS filesystem that points to another filesystem object.  The object being pointed to is called the target.  Symbolic links should be transparent to users; the links appear as normal files or directories, and can be acted upon by the user or application in exactly the same manner.  Symbolic links to directories or volumes, called junction points and mount points, were introduced with NTFS 3.0 that shipped with Windows 2000.  From NTFS 3.1 onwards, symbolic links can be created for any kind of file system object.  NTFS 3.1 was introduced together with Windows XP, but the functionality was not made available (through ntfs.sys) to user mode applications.  Third-party filter drivers such as Masatoshi Kimura's opensource codice_1 driver could however be installed to make the feature available in user mode as well.

Human eyes perceive blue when observing light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green.  Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres.  In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments, along with red and yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours.  Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green.  Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB colour model, used to create all the colours on the screen of a television or computer monitor. Innocent Records was a pop record label created to cater to for EMI's Virgin Records more pop oriented acts.  Following the success of the Spice Girls, Virgin Records decided to delve into the pop market.  In doing so they poached Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records (famous for steering Take That's initial flagging sales, to a multi-platinum act).  They let him launch his own Virgin Records offshoot.  His first signing was Billie Piper, followed by Martine McCutcheon, along with several dance acts Todd Terry to name one.  The label continued to thrive well into the mid-2000s with Atomic Kitten and Blue achieving Platinum sales.The ProPhoto RGB color space, also known as ROMM RGB (Reference Output Medium Metric), is an output referred RGB color space developed by Kodak.  It offers an especially large gamut designed for use with photographic output in mind.  The ProPhoto RGB color space encompasses over 90% of possible surface colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of likely occurring real-world surface colors documented by Pointer in 1980, making ProPhoto even larger than the Wide-gamut RGB color space.  The ProPhoto RGB primaries were also chosen in order to minimize hue rotations associated with non-linear tone scale operations.  One of the downsides to this color space is that approximately 13% of the representable colors are imaginary colors that do not exist and are not visible colors. The YCoCg color model is the color space formed from a simple transformation of an associated RGB color space into a luma value (denoted as Y) and two chroma values called chrominance green (Cg) and chrominance orange (Co).  It is supported in video and image compression designs such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, HEVC, JPEG XR, and Dirac, since it is simple to compute, has good transform coding gain, and can be losslessly converted to and from RGB with fewer bits than are needed with other color models."}], "output": ""},

Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and vocal register.  A singer's voice type is identified by a process known as voice classification, by which the human voice is evaluated and thereby designated into a particular voice type.

The name derives from the two Greek words, 'aster' (star) and 'phil' (lover), and the Latin word 'stella' meaning star.  Thus Astrophil is the star lover, and Stella is his star.  Sidney partly nativized the key features of his Italian model Petrarch, including an ongoing but partly obscure narrative, the philosophical trappings of the poet in relation to love and desire, and musings on the art of poetic creation.  Sidney also adopts the Petrarchan rhyme scheme, though he uses it with such freedom that fifteen variants are employed.

She was the runner up in singles at the 1974 French Open and 1974 Wimbledon Championships.The Williams sisters are two professional American tennis players: Venus Williams (b. 1980), a seven-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), and Serena Williams (b. 1981), twenty-three-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), both of whom were coached from an early age by their parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price.  There is a noted professional rivalry between them – between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two Serena Slams.  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.  Two weeks later, on 21 June 2010, Serena would hold the No. 1 singles ranking and Venus would be right behind her at No. 2 in singles.  Their most recent grand slam doubles titles came at the 2012 Wimbledon & 2016 Wimbledon events.  They remain very close, often watching each other's matches in support, even after one of them has been knocked out of a tournament. The 1968 US Open (formerly known as U.S. National Championships) was a tennis tournament that took place on the outdoor grass courts at the West Side Tennis Club, Forest Hills in New York, United States.

It was the first edition of the tournament in the Open Era of tennis and as such for the first time offered prize money, totaling $100,000.  Arthur Ashe and Virginia Wade won the singles titles.  Ashe was still registered as an amateur and therefore not entitled to the $14,000 first-prize money, which instead went to runner-up Tom Okker, while Wade earned $6,000.  Frank Parker, at the age of 52, lost to eventual champion Arthur Ashe in the second round, and still holds the record for the oldest man to compete in a Grand Slam singles tournament."}], "output": ""},

As Rhythms magazine said in 2015, Like many of Walker’s projects, Buried Country was at least a decade ahead of its time, and as such he is remarkable as a critic who has exerted a pro-active impact on Australian music and its development; groundbreaking books like Inner City Sound (1981) and Buried Country (2000) especially have informed and inspired successive generations of musicians.  Similarly, while he found best-selling success as Bon Scott's biographer, Walker's non-music books like Football Life (1998) and Golden Miles (2005) have innovatively offered an appreciation of subjects hitherto hardly deemed worthy of serious consideration.

Along with its three major forks (North Fork, Middle Fork and South Fork), it comprises a major river system that drains much of northeastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia, and northwestern North Carolina.  The Holston's confluence with the French Broad River at Knoxville marks the beginning of the Tennessee River. A longhunter (or long hunter) was an 18th-century explorer and hunter who made expeditions into the American frontier wilderness for as much as six months at a time.  Historian Emory Hamilton asserts that The Long Hunter was peculiar to Southwest Virginia only, and nowhere else on any frontier did such hunts ever originate although the term has been used loosely to describe any unofficial American explorer of the period.  Most long hunts started in the Holston River Valley near Chilhowie, Virginia.  The hunters came from there and the adjacent valley of the Clinch River, where they were land owners or residents.  The parties of two or three men (and rarely more) usually started their hunts in October and ended toward the end of March or early in April.Thái Bình river (Vietnamese: Sông Thái Bình) is the name of the Thái Bình river system's main river in Northern Vietnam.

Of the major battles of the Civil War, Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides.  Although the battle itself was inconclusive, the Union Army's repulse of two Confederate attacks and the subsequent Confederate withdrawal were a much-needed boost to Union morale after the defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg, and it dashed Confederate aspirations for control of Middle Tennessee. The Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, also known as the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on () or the Second Phase Campaign Western Sector (), was a decisive battle in the Korean War, and it took place from November 25 to December 2, 1950, along the Ch'ongch'on River Valley in the northwestern part of North Korea.  In response to the successful Chinese First Phase Campaign against the United Nations forces, General Douglas MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive to evict the Chinese forces from Korea and to end the war.  Anticipating this reaction, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander Peng Dehuai planned a counteroffensive, dubbed the Second Phase Campaign, against the advancing UN forces.The Battle of Glendale was a battle fought on the Inner Hebridean island of Skye, between the MacDonalds of Sleat and the MacDonalds of Clanranald, against the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan and the MacLeods of Lewis.  According to MacLeod tradition preserved in the early 19th century, the battle was fought in about the year 1490; yet it has been recently suggested that the battle more likely took place sometime after 1513.  MacLeod tradition records that the battle was the 'most tremendous battle' that the clan ever fought—although the clan was victorious, it never fully recovered from its severe losses.  MacLeod tradition relates how the MacDonalds originally had the upper hand during the conflict, but when the MacLeod's sacred Fairy Flag was unfurled the MacLeods gained heart and won the battle. The Battle of Berestechko (Polish: Bitwa pod Beresteczkiem ; Ukrainian: Берестецька битва, Битва під Берестечком ) was fought between the Ukrainian Cossacks, led by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, aided by their Crimean Tatar allies, and a Polish army under King John II Casimir.  It was a battle of a Cossack rebellion in Ukraine that took place in the years 1648–1657 after the expiration of a two-year truce.  Fought from 28 to 30 June 1651, the battle took place in the province of Volhynia, on the hilly plain south of the Styr River.  The Polish camp was on the river opposite Berestechko and faced south, towards the Cossack army about two kilometers away, whose right flank was against the River Pliashivka (Pliashova) and the Tatar army on their left flank.  It was probably the largest European land battle of the 17th century."}], "output": ""},

Cow Creek rises in the southern foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains in western Blaine County and flows east and then south, joining the Missouri approximately 25 mi northeast of Winifred, Montana—or 22 mi upstream from the Fred Robinson Bridge.  Cow Creek flows down to the Missouri in a canyon that passes through the Missouri Breaks, which are severely eroded badlands that extend out on either side from the Missouri River.  The floor of Cow Creek canyon provided a pathway of travel from the Montana plains north of the river, down to the Missouri – at the mouth of Cow Creek, Cow Island made fording the Missouri easier – a steep but short trail on the south bank of the Missouri opposite Cow Creek completed this route which led from the northern Montana plains to the central and southern Montana plains.  This pathway was used by migrating buffalo/bison and nomadic American Natives for centuries.  During the steamboat era on the Missouri River, when low water prevented riverboats getting up to Fort Benton, the mouth of Cow Creek became a river landing and freighting depot, and it was the start of the Cow Island Trail by which freight was moved on to Fort Benton by going north up Cow Creek and then west.  In 1877 the Nez Perce Indian Tribe, fleeing to Canada, had several skirmishes along Cow Creek including the Battle of Cow Island, and several days later at a camp on Cow Creek the Nez Perce, thinking themselves now beyond the reach of the U.S. Army, made the fateful decision to slow down, rather than push on for the Canada–US border.  Today, modern highways have by passed Cow Creek, and the buffalo and the nomadic Indian are gone.  Cow Creek is dormant, in one of the most remote spots of the isolated regions of the vast area known as the Montana Missouri Breaks.

Her commentary includes a profound contribution to Newtonian mechanics—the postulate of an additional conservation law for total energy, of which kinetic energy of motion is one element.Katherine Kath (11 August 1920 – 17 November 2012) was a French prima ballerina at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, who became an actress after suffering from an injury which destroyed her chances of continuing her career.

He resigned as mayor in September 2008 after being convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice.  Kilpatrick was sentenced to four months in jail and was released on probation after serving 99 days. The Detroit mayoral elections of 2009 took place on May 5, 2009, with a primary on February 24, 2009 to fill the vacancy created when Kwame Kilpatrick resigned as mayor.Jane Marum Roush (born September 24, 1956) is a Virginia lawyer and Judge who served as an interim Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia.  On July 27, 2015, Governor Terry McAuliffe announced his appointment of Roush to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice LeRoy F. Millette, Jr. effective July 31, 2015.  Under the Constitution of Virginia, this original interim appointment was to expire thirty days after the commencement of the next session of the Virginia General Assembly, unless the legislature elected her to a full twelve-year term.  On August 17, 2015, the General Assembly convened in special session but failed to elect anyone to the full twelve-year term before the Senate of Virginia purported to adjourn sine die.  The Constitution prohibits one chamber of the legislature from adjourning for more than three days without the consent of the other chamber.  The Governor claims that this provision applies only to regular sessions of the General Assembly; the House of Delegates and most Senate Republicans claim it applies to special sessions as well, and that the Senate's adjournment was invalid because the House did not consent.  Because there is legal uncertainty about whether the legislature was still in session, it is unclear whether the governor could fill the vacancy created when Justice Roush's original interim appointment expired on September 16, 2015.  Nevertheless, the governor announced his view that the legislature was not in session and purported to reappoint her for a second interim term.  Whether this second interim appointment was valid or invalid has not been determined.  If valid, the second interim appointment expired on February 12, 2016, thirty days after the regular session of the General Assembly began on January 13, because the legislature did not elect her to a full twelve-year term. This is a list of municipal elections held in the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  Elections for mayor were held annually until the 1923 election, when the election was for a two-year term.  From the 1971 election, the mayoral term was three years.  Elections for councillors and aldermen were held annually until the 1914 election, when the terms switched to two-year overlapping terms, with half of each council up for election each year.  From the 1971 election, the aldermanic elections lined up fully with the mayoral elections, and were also for three-year terms.  In 1976, the number of wards expanded to 14 (current number) with one alderman representing each ward for three years.  On December 14, 2010, council voted to change the title to councillor, which took effect in the October 2013 election.  In 2012 the Local Authorities Election Act was amended to increase the term length of the mayor and councillors to 4 years."}], "output": ""},

It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that raises blood pressure.  Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex.  Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up. Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.  It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon.  It plays a central role in the regulation of the plasma sodium (Na), the extracellular potassium (K) and arterial blood pressure.  It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.  It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume.  When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease.  Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart.The sodium-chloride symporter (also known as Na-Cl cotransporter, abbreviated as NCC or NCCT, or as the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter or TSC for short) is a cotransporter in the kidney which has the function of reabsorbing sodium and chloride ions from the tubular fluid into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron.  It is a member of the SLC12 cotransporter family of electroneutral cation-coupled chloride cotransporters.  In humans, it is encoded by the gene SLC12A3 (solute carrier family 12 member 3) located in 16q13. In the kidney, the loop of Henle ( ) (or Henle's loop, Henle loop, nephron loop or its Latin counterpart ansa nephroni) is the portion of a nephron that leads from the proximal convoluted tubule to the distal convoluted tubule.  Named after its discoverer, the German anatomist Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, the loop of Henle's main function is to create a concentration gradient in the medulla of the kidney."}], "output": ""},

Like his previous albums, half the record was written and produced by Stock Aitken & Waterman, and the other half were Astley's own compositions produced by PWL associates Phil Harding, Ian Curnow and Daize Washbourn.  The release of the album was delayed a few months due to a fire at PWL Studios destroying some of Astley's recorded material.  This would be Astley's last record with Stock, Aitken & Waterman, due to Astley wanting to leave behind the dance-pop sound of the producers, of wanting to shed his boy next door image, and wanting to focus on his original compositions on his albums, reappearing in 1991 with the soul album Free.

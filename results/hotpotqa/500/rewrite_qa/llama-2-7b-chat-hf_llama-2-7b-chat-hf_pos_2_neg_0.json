It is produced by the adrenal cortex and is a mineralocorticoid hormone that plays a central role in the regulation of sodium and potassium levels in the body. Aldosterone acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron to influence the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium, which indirectly affects blood pressure and blood volume. The proper functioning of the renin-angiotensin system, which includes aldosterone, is essential for maintaining normal blood pressure levels. When aldosterone is dysregulated, it can contribute to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease."}], "output": "  Aldosterone.**"},

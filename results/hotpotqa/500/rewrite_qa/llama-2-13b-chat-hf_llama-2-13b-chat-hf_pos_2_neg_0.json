The Argand lamp was brighter than earlier lamps, with an output of 6 to 10 candela, and required less frequent wick trimming due to its more complete combustion of the candle wick and oil. The Lewis lamp, invented by Winslow Lewis and patented in 1810, used a similar design to the Argand lamp but with a parabolic reflector and a magnifying lens made of green bottle glass. While the Argand variant was widely used by European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp design was chosen by the United States for use in American lighthouses."}], "output": "  Lighthouse lamp.**"},

In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties.\n\nAnswer: Leinster.\n\nPatrick Kennedy, a folklorist from Co. Wexford, Ireland, is known for his collections of Irish folktales from Leinster.

Paramount Pictures, Inc. (1948)\n\nHere's the revised paragraph with the correct order of the cases:\n\nNitrous oxide, frequently referred to as laughing gas, nitrous, or nos, is a nitrogen-based chemical compound with the molecular formula N2O. Under normal room temperature conditions, it manifests as a colorless, non-combustible gas possessing a faint sweet aroma and taste. However, when exposed to elevated temperatures, nitrous oxide exhibits potent oxidizing properties akin to those of molecular oxygen.\n\nBlock booking was the prevailing practice among Hollywood's major studios from the turn of the 1930s until it was outlawed by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. (1948). Under block booking, independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of a studio's pictures sight unseen. Those studios could then parcel out second-rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical. The element of the system involving the purchase of unseen pictures is known as blind bidding.\n\nIn Craig v. Boren (1972), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a state law limiting marriage to persons of the opposite sex did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The case was appealed, and the United States Supreme Court dismissed the appeal for want of a substantial federal question. The dismissal constituted a decision on the merits and established Baker v. Nelson as precedent, though the extent of its precedential effect had been subject to debate.\n\nIn Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly overruled Baker v. Nelson, making same-sex marriage legal nationwide."}], "output": "  Sure thing! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nUnited States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. came first.**"},

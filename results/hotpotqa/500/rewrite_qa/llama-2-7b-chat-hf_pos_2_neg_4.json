Crimes of Mortgage ad Real Estate Staff had long assisted nd finally the squeaky will could not continue as their deviant practices broke the state and crashed.  Modification owners either ordered by The United States Department of Housing, The United States IRS or President Obamas letters from Note Holders came to those various departments asking for the Democratic process to help them keep their homes and protection them from explosion.  Thus the birth of Modifications.  It is yet to date for clarity how theses enforcements came into existence and except b whom, but t is certain that note holders form the Midwest reached out in the Democratic Process for assistance.  FBI Mortgage Fraud Department came into existence.  Modifications HMAP HARP were also birthed to help note holders get Justice through reduced mortgage by making terms legal.  Modification of mortgage terms was introduced by IRS staff addressing the crisis called the HAMP TEAMS that went across the United States desiring the new products to assist homeowners that were victims of predatory lending practices, unethical staff, brokers, attorneys and lenders that contributed to the crash.  Modification were a fix to the crash as litigation has ensued as the lenders reorganized and renamed the lending institutions and government agencies are to closely monitor them.  Prior to modifications loan holders that experiences crisis would use Loan assumptions and Loan transfers to keep the note in the 1930s.  During the Great Depression, loan transfers, loan assumption, and loan bail out programs took place at the state level in an effort to reduce levels of loan foreclosures while the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Trade Commission, Comptroller, the United States Government and State Government responded to lending institution violations of law in these arenas by setting public court records that are legal precedence of such illegal actions.  The legal precedents and reporting agencies were created to address the violations of laws to consumers while the Modifications were created to assist the consumers that are victims of predatory lending practices.  During the so-called Great Recession of the early 21st century, loan modification became a matter of national policy, with various actions taken to alter mortgage loan terms to prevent further economic destabilization.  Due to absorbent personal profits nothing has been done to educate Homeowners or Creditors that this money from equity, escrow is truly theirs the Loan Note Holder and it is their monetary rights as the real prize and reason for the Housing Crash was the profit n obtaining the mortgage holders Escrow.  The Escrow and Equity that is accursed form the Note Holders payments various staff through the United States claimed as recorded and cashed by all staff in real-estate from local residential Tax Assessing Staff, Real Estate Staff, Ordinance Staff, Police Staff, Brokers, attorneys, lending institutional staff but typically Attorneys who are also typically the owners or Rental properties that are trained through Bankruptcies'.  that collect the Escrow that is rightfully the Homeowners but because most Homeowners are unaware of what money is due them and how they can loose their escrow.  Most Creditors are unaware that as the note holder that the Note Holder are due a annual or semi annual equity check and again bank or other lending and or legal intuitions staff claim this monies instead.  This money Note Holders were unaware of is the prize of real estate and the cause of the Real Estate Crash of 2008 where Lending Institutions provided mortgages to people years prior they know they would eventually loose with Loan holders purchasing Balloon Mortgages lending product that is designed to make fast money off the note holder whom is always typically unaware of their escrow, equity and that are further victimized by conferences and books on HOW TO MAKE MONEY IN REAL STATE - when in fact the money is the Note Holder.  The key of the crash was not the House, but the loan product used and the interest and money that was accrued form the note holders that staff too immorally.  The immoral and illegal actions of predatory lending station and their staff began with the inception of balloon mortgages although illegal activity has always existed in the arena, yet the crash created Watch Dog like HAMP TEAM, IRS, COMPTROLLER< Federal Trade Commission Consumer Protection Bureau, FBI, CIA, Local Police Department, ICE ( The FBI online Computer crime division receives and investigates computer crimes that record keeping staff from title companies, lending institutional staff, legal staff and others created fraudulent documents to change payments and billing of note holders to obtain the money note holders are typically unaware of) and other watch dog agencies came into existence to examine if houses were purchased through a processed check at Government Debited office as many obtained free homes illegally.  Many were incarcerated for such illegal actions.  Modifications fixed the Notes to proper lower interest, escrow, tax fees that staff typically raised for no reason.  Many people from various arenas involved in reals estate have been incarcerated for these actions as well as other illegal actions like charging for a modification.  Additionally Modifications were also made to address the falsifications such as inappropriate mortgage charges, filing of fraudulently deeds, reporting of and at times filing of fraudulent mortgages that were already paid off that were fraudulently continued by lenders staff and attorneys or brokers or anyone in the Real Estate Chain through the issues of real estate terms to continue to violate United States Laws, contract law and legal precedence where collusion was often done again to defraud and steal from the Note Holder was such a common practice that was evidence as to why the Mortgage Crash in 2008 occurred for the purpose of wining the prize of stealing form Homeowners and those that foreclosed was actually often purposefully for these monies note holders were unaware of to be obtained which was why Balloon mortgages and loans were given to the staff in the Real Estate Market with the hoper and the expectation that the loan holders would default as it offered opportunity to commit illegal transactions of obtaining the homeowners funds.  While such scams were addressed through modifications in 2008.  The Market relied heavily on Consumers ignorance to prosper, ignorance of real estate terms, ignorance on what they were to be charged properly for unethical financial gain and while staff in real estates lending arenas mingled terms to deceive y deliberate confusion consumers out of cash and homes while the USA Government provided Justice through President Obamas Inception and IRS Inception of Modifications which addressed these unethical profits in Reals Estate.  It was in 2009 that HARP, HAMP and Modifications were introduced to stop the victimization of Note Holders.  Taking on the Banks that ran USA Government was a great and dangerous undertaking that made America Great Again as Justice for Consumers reigned.  Legal action taken against institutions that have such business practices can be viewed in State Code of Law and Federal Law on precedent cases that are available to the public.  Finally, It had been unlawful to be charged by an attorney to modify as well as fro banking staff to modify terms to increase a mortgage and or change lending product to a balloon in an concerted effort to make homeowner foreclose which is also illegal, computer fraud and not the governments intended purpose or definition of a modification."}], "output": "  The Androscoggin Bank Colisée has a seating capacity of 3,677."},

The ordinance, entitled Measure H, was passed by referendum on March 2, 2004.  Initiated by the group GMO Free Mendocino, the campaign was a highly publicized grassroots effort by local farmers and environmental groups who contend that the potential risks of GMOs to human health and the ecosystem have not yet been fully understood.  The measure was met with opposition by several interest groups representing the biotechnology industry, The California Plant Health Association (now the Western Plant Health Association) and CropLife America, a Washington-based consortium whose clients represent some of the largest food distributors in the nation, including Monsanto, DuPont and Dow Chemical.  Since the enactment of the ordinance, Mendocino County has been added to an international list of GMO free zones.

Kansas City jazz is a style of jazz that developed in Kansas City, Kansas and Kansas City, Missouri and the surrounding Kansas City Metropolitan Area during the 1930s and marked the transition from the structured big band style to the musical improvisation style of Bebop.  The hard-swinging, bluesy transition style is bracketed by Count Basie who in 1929 signed with the Bennie Moten's Kansas City Orchestra and Kansas City native Charlie Parker who was to usher in the Bebop style in the 1940s.  According to a Kansas City website, While New Orleans was the birthplace of jazz, America's music grew up in Kansas City.  Kansas City is known as one of the most popular cradles of jazz.  Other cities include New Orleans, Chicago, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and New York City. Kansas City Scout is one of the United States' largest electronic traffic management systems.  It was created in 2000 as part of a bi-state initiative between the Missouri Department of Transportation and the Kansas Department of Transportation to provide this system for the Kansas City Metropolitan Area, which is in both Missouri and Kansas (the anchor city of Kansas City is in Missouri).  The project's cost was $43 million.  Of that amount, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) contributed 80-90 percent of the project cost.  KDOT and MoDOT shared the remaining cost.  The system employs a system of electronic boards placed on major highways throughout the metropolitan area that display traffic information whenever information needs to be displayed (due to an accident, lane closure, highway closure etc.), and the system also has cameras on those billboards to automatically detect traffic problems.  While the system has extensive coverage of highways in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area it still has much more to cover.  Since it would be too expensive to cover all the major highways in the Kansas City metro (which has more miles of highway per person than any other metropolitan area in the United States), studies were conducted to determine which highways or segments of highways have priority due to higher accident rates.  Since the project's beginning, it has expanded greatly, and will continue to expand.  Future plans are to extend coverage to I-635 and cover I-435 even more (especially in the northern areas of the metro) as well as other major city highways.  It was named after the iconic Kansas City Scout Statue that exists in Penn Valley Park, overlooking Downtown Kansas City."}], "output": "  The answer to your question is:\n\nThe University of Kansas.**"},

The software relies on iTunes and iPhoto and is controlled by an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys.  The first version was released October 2005, with two major revisions since.  Front Row was removed and discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7.A universal remote is a remote control that can be programmed to operate various brands of one or more types of consumer electronics devices.  Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.  Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.  For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions. In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.  For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.  A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.  In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. The Siri Remote is a remote control device released in tandem with the 4th Generation Apple TV at an Apple Keynote Address by CEO Tim Cook on October 26, 2015 by Apple Inc. The Remote is designed specifically to work with the always-on Siri capable Apple TV.  The device is a successor of the original Apple Remote.  It is also compatible with the Apple TV 4K. NetSupport Manager is a Windows-centric cross-platform remote control software, allowing remote screen control and systems management from a Windows or Windows Mobile device of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris and Mobile devices.  It was first released for DOS only networks in 1989.  It supports thumbnail display of unlimited remote systems (since version 10), and allows navigation between remote systems in a manner similar to a KVM switch.  Functionality includes file transfers, chat, and hardware/software inventory including software updates. Fewer features are supported for Linux and Mac clients.  In 2012 NetSupport introduced new software versions allowing Remote Control from iOS and Android tablets and smartphones as well as a new Mac OS Control.  Version 12 was released in October 2013, which extended platform support to include ChromeOS clients.  Mobile Remote Control from iOS and Android was also extended with additional capabilities.  All versions of NetSupport Manager require the pre-installation of the software on both the local (Control) and remote (Client) computers/devices prior to use."}], "output": "  Based on the provided passage, the other device that can control the program originally designed to interact with the Apple Remote is:\n\n* Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5\n\nThe Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5, and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers."},

The band's members are Kay Hanley, Greg McKenna, Michael Eisenstein, Stacy Jones, Scott Riebling, and later, Tom Polce. Screaming Trees was an American rock band formed in Ellensburg, Washington in 1985 by vocalist Mark Lanegan, guitarist Gary Lee Conner, bass player Van Conner and drummer Mark Pickerel.  Pickerel had been replaced by Barrett Martin by the time the band reached its most successful period.  Although widely associated with grunge, the band's sound incorporated hard rock and psychedelic elements.  During Screaming Trees' existence the band released seven studio albums, five EPs, and three compilations.Truly is an American rock band formed in the wake of the grunge era.  It featured singer-guitarist Robert Roth, bassist Hiro Yamamoto, and drummer Mark Pickerel.  Yamamoto and Pickerel were founding members respectively of Soundgarden and Screaming Trees.  While not a commercially successful group like some of their Seattle contemporaries, the band lasted a decade with two studio albums to their name. Change Has Come was the only recording the Screaming Trees released through Sub Pop.  Released in 1990 the Screaming Trees then moved on to a major label, Epic Records, for their next three albums - Uncle Anesthesia, Sweet Oblivion, and Dust, as well as the Something About Today EP. Jamboree is the second album by Beat Happening, released in 1988 through K Records/Rough Trade Records.  All songs were produced by Steve Fisk with assistance from Screaming Trees members Mark Lanegan and Gary Lee Conner (who plays a brief guitar solo on Midnight a Go-Go), except Cat Walk, produced by Patrick Maley, and The This Many Boyfriends Club, recorded live by Rich Jensen.  The album marks a darker approach to the Twee pop for which the band is known, due largely to a thicker production than is present on the group's earlier recordings and the dominance of tracks written by Calvin Johnson, while Heather Lewis only provides vocals on two songs, the uncharacteristically brash In Between and the more typically understated Ask Me.  At the time of the album's release, Calvin described Jamboree's sound as dark and sexy.  Still, the band retained their emphasis on exuberance over musicianship, as Bret Lunsford stated in an interview that, while recording album opener Bewitched, his guitar string got stuck on a protruding screw and he continued to play through the song, hitting the string a bit harder until it became unstuck. Gary Lee Conner (born Lee Gary Conner on August 22, 1962 in Fort Irwin, California, USA) was the lead guitarist for rock act Screaming Trees, along with his brother Van Conner, who was the band's bassist.  Conner began his career with Screaming Trees in 1985 which lasted until their disbanding in 2000.  During that time he released two non-Tree albums: The Purple Outside-Mystery Lane (1990 New Alliance Records) with brother Patrick Conner on Drums and the single Grasshopper's Daydream/Behind The Smile (1999 sub pop) this album also featured Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age.  Appearances on other artists material include, Beat Happening Indian Summer and Midnight a Go-Go from Jamboree as well as Against the 70s by Mike Watt from Ball-Hog or Tugboat?  (1995 Columbia Records).  After ten years of seclusion he finally released a new album in 2010 from his band Microdot Gnome.  The album 4D Sugarcubes was released on Moonbus International Recordings in April 2010 as was available on CD and MP3.  At the moment he is planning future releases from Microdot Gnome.

Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms.  After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government.  In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.  The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.  The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражда́нская война́ в Росси́и , Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi ; November 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.  The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.Communism in Russia began after Tsar Nicholas II lost his power during the February Revolution.  The Provisional Government was established under Prince Lvov, however, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the government and revolted in October 1917, taking control of Russia.  Vladmir Lenin, their leader, rose to power and governed between 1917 and 1924.  The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites.  In 1922 the Communist Reds were victorious, and formed the Soviet Union.  Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power.  He was the leader of the Communist Party until 1953.  He encouraged political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his dominance. Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov (Russian: Лавр Гео́ргиевич Корни́лов , ] ; 18 August 1870 – 13 April 1918) was a military intelligence officer, explorer, and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the ensuing Russian Civil War.  He is today best remembered for the Kornilov Affair, an unsuccessful endeavor in August/September 1917 that purported to strengthen Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government, but which led to Kerensky eventually having Kornilov arrested and charged with attempting a coup d'état, and ultimately undermined the rule of Kerensky; strengthening the claims and power of the soviets, and the Bolshevik party. The left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks were a series of rebellions and uprisings against the Bolsheviks by rival left-wing parties that started soon after the October Revolution, continued through the Russian Civil War, and lasted into the first few years of Soviet rule.  They were led or supported by left-wing groups such as some factions of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists.  The uprisings started in 1918 and continued during and after the Civil War until around 1924.  The Bolsheviks increasingly abandoned attempts to invite these groups to join the government and instead suppressed them with force. Louise Bryant (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American feminist, political activist, and journalist best known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution.  Bryant, who married writer John Reed, her second husband, in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky.  Her news stories, distributed by Hearst during and after her trips to Petrograd and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following World War I.  A collection of articles from her first trip was published in book form as Six Red Months in Russia in 1918.  During the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the Overman Committee, a Senate subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States.  Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce armed U.S. intervention in Russia."}], "output": "  Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War in 1918."},

The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.  The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times. A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants.  These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier.  These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.  Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier. The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog.  It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters.  The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail.  The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton. The Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: Русский той, Тойчик ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier.  There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat.  The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier.  Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the Terrier was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010.  The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia."}], "output": "  Based on the passage provided, the dog breed that includes Gordon and Irish Setters in its ancestry is the Manchester Terrier."},

This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty. Giuseppe Edoardo Arimondi, OSML, OMS, OCI (Savigliano, 26 April 1846 – Adwa, 1 March 1896) was an Italian general, mostly known for his role during the First Italo-Ethiopian War.  He was one of the few European commanders who gained a victory over the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, soundly defeating them at Agordat in 1893.  After a long and successfull colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. Ethiopia–Japan relations are the international relations between Ethiopia and Japan.  Both were nations with an ancient history which successfully repulsed European military advances to dominate them, Ethiopia at the Battle of Adwa, and Japan at the Battle of Tsushima, and as a result both nations considered each other potential allies prior to World War II. Ethiopia is a landlocked sovereign country located in the Horn of Africa.  Ethiopia is bordered by Eritrea to the north, Sudan to the west, South Sudan to the south-west, Kenya to the south, Somalia to the east and Djibouti to the north-east.  Ethiopia is one of the oldest countries in the world and Africa's second-most populous nation.  Ethiopia has yielded some of humanity's oldest traces, making the area important in the history of human evolution.  Recent studies claim that the vicinity of present-day Addis Ababa was the point from which human beings migrated around the world.  Ethiopian dynastic history traditionally began with the reign of Emperor Menelik I in 1000 BC.  The roots of the Ethiopian state are similarly deep, dating with unbroken continuity to at least the Aksumite Empire (which adopted the name Ethiopia in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, D`mt (with early 1st millennium BC roots).  After a period of decentralized power in the 18th and early 19th centuries known as the Zemene Mesafint (Era of the Judges/Princes), the country was reunited in 1855 by Kassa Hailu, who became Emperor Tewodros II, beginning Ethiopia's modern history.  Ethiopia's borders underwent significant territorial expansion to its modern borders for the rest of the century, especially by Emperor Menelik II and Ras Gobena, culminating in its victory over the Italians at the Battle of Adwa in 1896 with the military leadership of Ras Makonnen, and ensuring its sovereignty and freedom from colonization.  It was brutally occupied by Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy from 1936 to 1941, ending with its liberation by British Empire and Ethiopian Patriot forces. Saint Ephigenia of Ethiopia or Iphigenia of Ethiopia (Spanish: Efigênia ; Portuguese: Ifigênia ; French: Iphigénie ; ), also called Iphigenia of Abyssinia (1st century), is a folk saint whose life is told in the Golden Legend as a virgin converted to Christianity and then consecrated to God by St. Matthew the Apostle, who was spreading the Gospel to the region of Ethiopia, which in this case is understood to be located in the regions south of the Caspian Sea, either in one of the provinces of Mesopotamia (Assyria and Babylon), or in Ancient Armenia (Colchis)."}], "output": "  The battle in which Giuseppe Arimondi lost his life secured Ethiopian sovereignty.**"},

The first track, To Know Him Is to Love Him, released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears.  Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, The First Tycoon of Teen.  The package also contained a small, round, red Back to Mono pin. To Know Him Is to Love Him is a song written by Phil Spector, inspired by words on his father's tombstone, To Know Him Was To Love Him.  It was first recorded by the only vocal group of which he was a member, the Teddy Bears.  Their recording spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in 1958, while reaching No. 2 on UK's New Musical Express chart.  Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton later had hits with the song, with its title and lyrics changed to To Know You Is to Love You.  In 1987, the song was resurrected by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris, whose Trio recording topped the U.S. country singles charts.  The song is in 12/8 time.Trash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands.  This box set is similar to the earlier Pebbles Box (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc.  Supposedly, the Trash Box collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on Pebbles, Volume 4 have been eschewed entirely.  Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the Pebbles Box.  Although most of the recordings on the Trash Box were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series.  Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit I Fought the Law (but the Law Won) by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) – which is also included in the Pebbles Box – in place of the much rarer Wine Wine Wine by Bobby Fuller that appears on Pebbles, Volume 2. Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003.  At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format.  This box set, and the companion release Rancho Texicano, were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from ZZ Top's First Album, Rio Grande Mud, and Tejas, aside from 1977's The Best of ZZ Top which features two tracks from Rio Grande Mud and one track from First Album.  Tres Hombres and Fandango!  were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes. Live in Japan is a four-disc box set by American saxophonist John Coltrane and his last group, featuring the quintet of Coltrane, his wife/pianist Alice, saxophonist/bass clarinetist Pharoah Sanders, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Rashied Ali.  The 4-CD set compiles all the music issued as three albums in the seventies by Impulse! ; Concert In Japan (1973, US 2-LP, electronically processed for compatible quadrophonic/stereo), Coltrane In Japan (1974, Japan 3-LP (side six is blank), mono) and Second Night In Tokyo (1976, Japan 3-LP (side six contains an interview, mono).  (Some of this material was also reissued as two 2-LP sets in 1980 by MCA under the titles Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  1 and Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  2) The first CD issues were by Impulse!  Japan as two 2-CD sets: Live In Japan Vol.  1 (same as Coltrane In Japan) and Live In Japan Vol.  2 (same as Second Night In Tokyo).  The US 4-CD edition includes both of these volumes, with identical mastering from the original mono tapes.  The side six interview from Second Night In Tokyo has never been reissued on any CD edition. Nashville Rebel is a box set by Waylon Jennings, released on RCA Records through Legacy Recordings in 2006.  According to Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, it is the first comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembled, comprising ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with selections from the majority of the singer's recording career.  The first track of the box set is the Buddy Holly-produced Jole Blon, released in 1958, while the last is I Do Believe, a song produced by Don Was that was included on The Highwaymen's 1995 release, The Road Goes on Forever.  The other material on the box set covers Jennings' career chronologically, with songs ranging from his years on RCA's roster to later compositions from his short-lived stay at Epic Records; it ignores, however, the tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels.  The majority of the singer's charting singles are included in the package, as are collaborations such as Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys with Willie Nelson and Highwayman with The Highwaymen.  A notable addition is the previously unreleased The Greatest Cowboy of Them All, a 1978 duet with Johnny Cash which was later recorded by Cash alone for A Believer Sings the Truth (1979) and The Mystery of Life (1991); two others, It's Sure Been Fun and People in Dallas Got Hair, had never been released in the United States.  Nashville Rebel was released on four CDs, with a 140-page booklet and liner notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye."}], "output": "  The song \"To Know Him Is to Love Him\" was written and recorded by Phil Spector, and the answer to your question is: Phil Spector."},

Containing approximately 700 species, it is the largest genus in the family.  Common names include campion (which is shared with the related genus Lychnis) and catchfly.  Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Ferocactus is a genus of large barrel-shaped cacti, mostly with large spines and small flowers.  There are about 30 species included in the genus.  They are found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.Silene latifolia (formerly Melandrium album), the white campion is a dioecious flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae, native to most of Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa.  It is a herbaceous annual, occasionally biennial or a short-lived perennial plant, growing to between 40-80 centimetres tall.  It is also known in the USA as bladder campion but should not be confused with Silene vulgaris, which is more generally called Bladder Campion.

From its formation in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps, it has flown a variety of aircraft types including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C).  During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions.  It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities.  The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937.  It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.  The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra.  It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C Wedgetail.  One of the six Boeing 737s was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS. The English Electric Canberra is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber that was manufactured during the 1950s.  It was developed by English Electric during the mid-to-late 1940s in response to a 1944 Air Ministry requirement for a successor to the wartime de Havilland Mosquito fast-bomber.  Amongst the performance requirements for the type was the demand for an outstanding high altitude bombing capability in addition to flying at high speeds.  These were partly accomplished by making use of newly developed jet propulsion technology.  When the Canberra was introduced to service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), the type's first operator, in May 1951, it became the service's first jet-powered bomber aircraft.The South West Pacific theatre, during World War II, was a major theatre of the war between the Allies and Japan.  It included the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (except for Sumatra), Borneo, Australia and its mandate Territory of New Guinea (including the Bismarck Archipelago) and the western part of the Solomon Islands.  This area was defined by the Allied powers' South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command. The Asiatic-Pacific Theater, was the theater of operations of U.S. forces during World War II in the Pacific War during 1941-45.  From mid-1942 until the end of the war in 1945, there were two U.S. operational commands in the Pacific.  The Pacific Ocean Areas (POA), divided into the Central Pacific Area, the North Pacific Area and the South Pacific Area, were commanded by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief Pacific Ocean Areas.  The South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was commanded by General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific Area.  During 1945, the United States added the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, commanded by General Carl A. Spaatz. The Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 Sparviero (Italian for sparrowhawk) was a three-engined Italian medium bomber with a wood-and-metal structure.  Originally designed as a fast passenger aircraft, between 1937 and 1939 this low-wing monoplane set 26 world records, qualifying it for some time as the fastest medium bomber in the world.  It first saw action during the Spanish Civil War and flew on all fronts in which Italy was involved during World War II.  It achieved success as a torpedo bomber in the Mediterranean theater, and became the best-known Italian aeroplane of the war.  It was easily recognizable due to its distinctive fuselage dorsal hump, and was well liked by its crews, who nicknamed it il gobbo maledetto (damned hunchback). South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was the name given to the Allied supreme military command in the South West Pacific Theatre of World War II.  It was one of four major Allied commands in the Pacific War.  SWPA included the Philippines, Borneo, the Dutch East Indies (excluding Sumatra), East Timor, Australia, the Territories of Papua and New Guinea, and the western part of the Solomon Islands.

It is the home of the Indianapolis 500 and the Brickyard 400, and formerly the home of the United States Grand Prix.  It is located on the corner of 16th Street and Georgetown Road, approximately 6 mi west of Downtown Indianapolis. The 41st International 500-Mile Sweepstakes was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on Thursday, May 30, 1957.  The event was part of the 1957 USAC National Championship Trail and it was race 3 of 8 in the 1957 World Championship of Drivers.The Subway 400 was the second race of the NASCAR Winston Cup Series season until 2004, held a week after the Daytona 500.  This 400-mile (644 km) annual race was sponsored by Subway and was held at North Carolina Speedway (The Rock) since 1966.  From 1966 to 1995, a 500-mile (805-km) race was held; the race was known as the Peach Blossom 500 (1966), the Carolina 500 (1967–1985), and the Goodwrench 500 (1986–1995).  In 1996, the race was shortened to its current distance of 400 miles; the 400 mile race was called the Goodwrench Service 400 (1996–1997), the GM Goodwrench Service Plus 400 (1998), the Dura Lube/Big K 400 (1999), the Dura Lube/Kmart 400 (2000), the Dura Lube 400 (2001), and the Subway 400 (2002–2004). The Carolina Dodge Dealers 400 was the annual spring NASCAR Sprint Cup race held at Darlington Raceway in Darlington, South Carolina, USA.  A 100 mi race was held in May at the track in 1952, however the event did not become a regular one on the NASCAR schedule until 1957, as a 300 mi race in the Convertible Division, known as the Rebel 300.  In 1966, the race was expanded to 400 mi , and in 1973 to 500 mi .  In 1994, the race was returned to 400 miles.  In 2005, as part of the settlement of the Ferko lawsuit and as part of a schedule realignment, Darlington was forced to contract to one race date, with the 500 mile race (the famous Southern 500) moving to Mother's Day weekend.  The 400 mile race was eliminated, although Dodge's sponsorship was transferred to the 500 miler. The Louis Schwitzer Award is presented annually to an engineer, or a team of engineers, for excellence in the design, development and implementation of new, innovative motorsports technology concepts for use in the Indianapolis 500 Mile Race.  The focus of this award is on those concepts that improve the performance, safety, or energy efficiency of racing cars, related components and systems, or driver and race track support equipment. The Lean Horse Ultramarathon is run in August every year in the Black Hills of South Dakota.  It was first run in 2005.  It features a 100-mile race, a 50-mile race, and a 50-kilometer race.

Associated in particular with the spinto and dramatic tenor roles of the Italian repertory, he was celebrated universally for his powerhouse voice, electrifying top notes, clear timbre, passionate singing and remarkable performances.  Dubbed the Prince of tenors, Corelli possessed handsome features and a charismatic stage presence which endeared him to audiences.  He had a long and fruitful partnership with the Metropolitan Opera in New York City between 1961 and 1975.  He also appeared on the stages of most of the major opera houses in Europe and with opera companies throughout North America. Tosca is a 1956 Italian musical film directed by Carmine Gallone and starring Franca Duval, Afro Poli and Franco Corelli.  It is based on the opera Tosca by Giacomo Puccini.  It was made at Cinecittà in Rome.Ron Bottcher (11 May 1940 – 12 April 1991) was an American operatic baritone who was actively performing with both the New York City Opera (NYCO) and the Metropolitan Opera during the 1960s.  A native of Sandpoint, Idaho, he earned music degrees from the University of Montana and the Curtis Institute of Music.  He made his debut at the Santa Fe Opera in the summer of 1961, where he portrayed the roles of Leopold in Richard Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier, Marcello in Giacomo Puccini's La bohème, and the Head waiter in Paul Hindemith's Neues vom Tage.  His roles at the NYCO included Escamillo in Georges Bizet's Carmen and Sharpless in Puccini's Madama Butterfly among others.  At the Met he created roles in the world premieres of Samuel Barber's Antony and Cleopatra and Marvin David Levy's Mourning Becomes Electra.  He died at the age of 50 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan of AIDS related illness. La bohème (also known as La bohème de Puccini) is a 1988 Italian-French film of an opera directed by Luigi Comencini.  It is based on Giacomo Puccini's La bohème. Gianni Schicchi (] ) is a comic opera in one act by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Giovacchino Forzano, composed in 1917–18.  The libretto is based on an incident mentioned in Dante's Divine Comedy.  The work is the third and final part of Puccini's Il trittico (The Triptych)—three one-act operas with contrasting themes, originally written to be presented together.  Although it continues to be performed with one or both of the other trittico operas, Gianni Schicchi is now more frequently staged either alone or with short operas by other composers.  The aria O mio babbino caro is one of Puccini's best known, and one of the most popular arias in opera. O mio babbino caro  (Oh My Beloved Father) is a soprano aria from the opera Gianni Schicchi (1918) by Giacomo Puccini to a libretto by Giovacchino Forzano.  It is sung by Lauretta after tensions between her father Schicchi and the family of Rinuccio, the boy she loves, have reached a breaking point that threatens to separate her from Rinuccio.  It provides an interlude expressing lyrical simplicity and single-hearted love in contrast with the atmosphere of hypocrisy, jealousy, double-dealing, and feuding in the medieval Florence of Puccini's only comedy.  It provides the only set-piece in the through-composed opera."}], "output": "  In what city did the Prince of tenors, Franco Corelli, star in a film based on an opera by Giacomo Puccini?\n\nAnswer: Rome.**"},

The Regional Resettlement Arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea, colloquially known as the PNG solution, is the name given to an Australian government policy in which any asylum seeker who comes to Australia by boat without a visa will be refused settlement in Australia, instead being settled in Papua New Guinea if they are found to be legitimate refugees.  The policy includes a significant expansion of the Australian immigration detention facility on Manus Island, where refugees will be sent to be processed prior to resettlement in Papua New Guinea, and if their refugee status is found to be non-genuine, they will be either repatriated, sent to a third country other than Australia or remain in detention indefinitely.  The policy was announced on 19 July 2013 by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Peter O'Neill, effective immediately, in response to a growing number of asylum seeker boat arrivals.

Car drifting is caused when the rear slip angle is greater than the front slip angle, to such an extent that often the front wheels are pointing in the opposite direction to the turn (e.g. car is turning left, wheels are pointed right or vice versa, also known as opposite lock or counter-steering). D1NZ is a production car drifting series in New Zealand.  There is currently no New Zealand drifting championship so D1NZ is the premier series running as a clubsport advanced event under MotorSport New Zealand.  It began early in 2003 as a small competition consisting of several drifting teams from all over the country in order to organise and regulate Drifting events on the circuit.  Since then it has continued to grow larger and more professional, now involving professional drivers with sponsored cars.  The series now includes two championships: Pro and Pro-sport.  New competitors generally need to prove themselves in the Pro-sport championship before entering the Pro championship (unless coming from an equivalent international series).  Organizers aim to promote and educate Drifting in New Zealand, with a regulated safe environment.  Despite similar moniker, the series is not related to the Japanese D1 Grand Prix series.

They grow to 5–50 cm tall, with opposite leaves. Cypress is a conifer tree or shrub of northern temperate regions that belongs to the family Cupressaceae.  The word cypress is derived from Old French cipres, which was imported from Latin cypressus, the latinisation of the Greek κυπάρισσος (kyparissos).Fokienia is a genus of conifer tree belonging to the cypress family.  In its characteristics, Fokienia is intermediate between the genera of Chamaecyparis and Calocedrus.  Genetically Fokienia is much closer to Chamaecyparis, and not all researchers recognize Fokienia as a separate genus.  The genus comprises only one living species, Fokienia hodginsii or Fujian cypress (; Vietnamese: Pơmu ), and one fossil species (Fokienia ravenscragensis). The Frenchman Formation is stratigraphic unit of Late Cretaceous (late Maastrichtian) age in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.  It is present in southern Saskatchewan and the Cypress Hills of southeastern Alberta.  The formation was defined by G.M. Furnival in 1942 from observations of outcrops along the Frenchman River, between Ravenscrag and Highway 37.  It contains the youngest of dinosaur genera, much like the Hell Creek Formation in the United States. The genus Cupressus is one of several genera within the family Cupressaceae that have the common name cypress; for the others, see cypress.  It is considered a polyphyletic group.  Based on genetic and morphological analysis, the Cupressus genus is found in the Cupressoideae subfamily.  The common name comes from Old French cipres and that from Latin cyparissus, which is the latinisation of the Greek κυπάρισσος (kypárissos). Cedrol is a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the essential oil of conifers (cedar oil), especially in the genera Cupressus (cypress) and Juniperus (juniper).  It has also been identified in Origanum onites, a plant related to oregano.  Its main uses are in the chemistry of aroma compounds.  It makes up about 19% of cedarwood oil Texas and 15.8% of cedarwood oil Virginia."}], "output": "  Yes, both Cypress and Ajuga are genera.\n\n* Cypress (Genus: Cupressus)\n* Ajuga (Genus: Ajuga)"},

In the 1992 NBA draft, the Hornets selected center Alonzo Mourning out of Georgetown with the second overall pick.  With the addition of Mourning, along with second-year star Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues, the Hornets struggled around .500 for most of the season, but won 9 of their final 12 games finishing their season third in the Central Division with a 44–38 record, and qualified for their first ever playoff appearance.  The team became the first of the four expansion franchises of the late 1980s to win a playoff series, when Mourning sunk a 20 ft jumper at the buzzer in Game 4 of the first round playoff series against the 4th-seeded Boston Celtics.  However, in the semifinals, the Hornets were eliminated by the New York Knicks in five games. Tyrone Curtis Muggsy Bogues (born January 9, 1965) is an American retired basketball player.  The shortest player ever to play in the National Basketball Association, the 5 ft Bogues played point guard for four teams during his 14-season career in the NBA.  He is best known for his ten seasons with the Charlotte Hornets, and also played for the Washington Bullets, Golden State Warriors, and Toronto Raptors.  After his NBA career, he served as head coach of the now-defunct WNBA team Charlotte Sting.The Charlotte Hornets are an American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  They play in the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The Hornets were first established in 1988 as an expansion team, but relocated to New Orleans following the 2001–02 season.  In 2004, a new expansion team, the Charlotte Bobcats, was established.  After 10 seasons as the Bobcats, the team changed its name to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 season, a year after the New Orleans franchise relinquished the Hornets name and renamed itself the Pelicans.  In addition to re-inheriting the Hornets name from New Orleans, the Charlotte franchise reclaimed the history and records of the original 1988–2002 Hornets, effectively becoming a continuation of the original franchise. The Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball team, representing Texas Tech University, has had 9 players drafted into the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) since the league began holding drafts in 1997.  Sheryl Swoopes was Texas Tech's first player drafted in the WNBA, selected in the 1997 Initial Player Allocation.  The Charlotte Sting had drafted three Lady Raiders, more than any other WNBA franchise: Michi Atkins, in the WNBA Elite Draft, and Angie Braziel and Jia Perkins during the college draft. The original Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) were established in 1988 as an expansion team, based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The team's roster was filled with unprotected players at the 1988 NBA Expansion Draft, and five days later the Hornets made their first picks out of college players at the 1988 NBA draft.  The Hornets remained in Charlotte for 14 seasons before relocating to New Orleans in 2002.  Two years after the Hornets' departure, the Charlotte Bobcats were established in 2004.  The Bobcats first participated in the 2004 NBA draft, two days after their expansion draft was held.  The franchise's name was changed back to the Hornets at the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, one year after the team in Louisiana renamed itself the New Orleans Pelicans.  The history and records of the original Charlotte Hornets were conveyed to the newly named Charlotte Hornets. Ayana D’Nay Walker (born September 10, 1979) is an American former women's basketball player.  She played for the Louisiana Tech Lady Techsters basketball team from 1998 to 2002.  Walker was a member of gold-medal winning USA Basketball Women’s National Team in 2001 and set a USA single-game record with 19 rebounds in gold-medal game.  She was also a member of gold-medal winning USA Basketball World University Games Team in 2001.  Walker was drafted as the 20th overall pick by the Detroit Shock in the 2002 WNBA Draft.  As a member of the Shock, she won the 2003 WNBA Championship.  On July 3, 2005, Walker signed with the Charlotte Sting.

Rather than focusing on themes, Goldsmith creates a bleak and dissonant soundscape that fits the film's dark and intense atmosphere, with only a few romantic cues. Alien is a 1979 science-fiction horror film directed by Ridley Scott, and starring Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, John Hurt, Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto.  The film's title refers to a highly aggressive extraterrestrial creature that stalks and attacks the crew of a spaceship.  Dan O'Bannon, drawing upon previous works of science fiction and horror, wrote the screenplay from a story he co-authored with Ronald Shusett.  The film was produced by Gordon Carroll, David Giler and Walter Hill through their company Brandywine Productions, and was distributed by 20th Century Fox.  Giler and Hill revised and made additions to the script.  Shusett was executive producer.  The eponymous Alien and its accompanying elements were designed by the Swiss artist H. R. Giger, while concept artists Ron Cobb and Chris Foss designed the more human aspects of the film.Christus Apollo: Cantata Celebrating the Eighth Day of Creation and the Promise of the Ninth is a cantata in four movements for narrator, mezzo-soprano, choir, and orchestra, based on a text by the science fiction author Ray Bradbury and composed by the American composer Jerry Goldsmith.  The piece was commissioned by the California Chamber Symphony in 1969, and premiered later that year in Royce Hall at UCLA with the narration performed by Charlton Heston (who had starred in the 1968 film, Planet of the Apes, for which Goldsmith had composed the musical score). L.A.

The original score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith. Innerspace is a 1987 American science fiction comedy film directed by Joe Dante and produced by Michael Finnell.  Steven Spielberg served as executive producer.  The film was inspired by the 1966 science fiction film Fantastic Voyage.  It stars Dennis Quaid, Martin Short and Meg Ryan, with Robert Picardo and Kevin McCarthy, with music composed by Jerry Goldsmith.  It earned well over $25 million in its domestic gross revenue and won an Oscar, the only film directed by Dante to do so. The score to the 1986 James Cameron film Aliens was composed by James Horner.  The score itself includes musical references to Gayane's Adagio from Aram Khachaturian's Gayane ballet suite, which had been used in Stanley Kubrick's  (1968).  The score also uses musical motifs, sound treatments and excerpts from Jerry Goldsmith's original soundtrack to Alien (1979).  Additional cues taken from Jerry Goldsmith's Alien score were used in the climax of the film when Horner was unable to finish some cues to Cameron's satisfaction.  The film's editors also reportedly altered the score's chronological flow, sometimes looping, truncating or removing the music and placing it in fragmented form in the film out of context.  Despite production issues, it was nominated for an Academy Award in 1986.  It was performed by the London Symphony Orchestra.  The soundtrack album was released the following year, in 1987."}], "output": "  The executive producer of the film Alien is Gordon Carroll.**"},

The EFL Cup (referred to historically, and colloquially, as simply the League Cup), currently known as the Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons, is an annual knockout football competition in men's domestic English football.  Organised by the English Football League (EFL), it is open to any club within the top four levels of the English football league system – 92 clubs in total – comprising the top level Premier League, and the three divisions of the English Football League's own league competition (Championship, League One and League Two).The 2007–08 Wigan Athletic F.C. season was the club's 30th season in the Football League and their third season in the Premier League. Springfield Park was a multi-purpose stadium in Wigan, Greater Manchester.  It was the home ground of Wigan Athletic F.C. until the club moved to the new JJB Stadium (now DW Stadium) after the 1998–99 season.  At its largest, the stadium held 40,000.  In its 102-year existence the ground only saw 32 years as a Football League venue, 11 years for Wigan Borough F.C. and 21 years for Wigan Athletic FC, before it was demolished to make way for a housing estate in 1999.

Similar to the FA Trophy, it is played on a knockout (single elimination) basis in September and October towards the beginning of each Pro League season.  Unlike the FA Trophy, where 36 teams enter each season from the top three tiers of the Trinidad and Tobago football league system and the Secondary Schools Football League, only teams from the TT Pro League compete in the league cup.  The knockout tournament was inaugurated in 2000 and is currently sponsored by First Citizens Bank.  Although the league cup is one of the three major domestic trophies attainable by Trinidad and Tobago league teams, it is perceived as a lower priority than the league championship and the FA Trophy.  The current theme is Where Winners Reign, with TT$110,000 to the winner, TT$20,000 to the runners-up, semifinal winners receive TT$7,000, quaterfinal winners receive TT$5,000 and Play-off round winners receive TT$3,000.

The film was directed by Lloyd Kaufman from a screenplay by Kaufman and James Gunn, who also served as associate director. James Gunn (born August 5) is an American screenwriter, director, producer, novelist, actor, and musician.  He started his career as a screenwriter in the mid-1990s, writing the scripts for Tromeo and Juliet (1996), Scooby-Doo (2002) and its sequel  (2004), and the 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead.  He then started working also as a director, starting with Slither (2006).  He subsequently wrote and directed the web series James Gunn's PG Porn, and the superhero films Super (2010), Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.  2 (2017).William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet may be one of the most-screened plays of all time.  The most notable theatrical releases were George Cukor's multi-Oscar-nominated 1936 production Romeo and Juliet, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film Romeo and Juliet, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet.  The latter two were both, at the time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare films.  Cukor featured the mature actors Norma Shearer and Leslie Howard as the teenage lovers while Zeffirelli populated his film with beautiful young people, and Baz Luhrmann produced a heavily cut fast-paced version aimed at teenage audiences. Romeo Montague (Italian: Romeo Montecchi ) is the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet.  The son of Montague and his wife, he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet.  Forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death. William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet (shortened to Romeo + Juliet) is a 1996 American romantic drama film directed, co-produced, and co-written by Baz Luhrmann, co-produced by Gabriella Martinelli, and co-written by Craig Pearce, being an adaptation and modernization of William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet.  The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the leading roles of Romeo and Juliet, who instantly fall in love when Romeo crashes a party and meets her, despite their being members of the Montague and Capulet family; Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo, Pete Postlethwaite, Paul Sorvino, and Diane Venora star in supporting roles. A rose by any other name would smell as sweet is a popular reference to William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, in which Juliet seems to argue that it does not matter that Romeo is from her rival's house of Montague, that is, that he is named Montague.  The reference is often used to imply that the names of things do not affect what they really are.  This formulation is, however, a paraphrase of Shakespeare's actual language, seen underlined below.  This scene is called the balcony scene by many people.  Juliet not only makes the statement above but compares Romeo to a rose saying that if he wasn't named Romeo he would still be handsome and be Juliet's Love.  Also as said before this states that if he wasn't Romeo, then he wouldn't be a Montague and she would be able to get married with no problem at all."}], "output": "  The name of the 1996 loose adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet written by James Gunn is Romeo + Juliet.**"},

Mexia was stationed in St Augustine and was given a diplomatic mission to the native populations living south of St. Augustine and in the Cape Canaveral area.  This mission resulted in a Period of Friendship between the Spanish and the Ais native population. The Indigenous peoples of Florida lived in what is now known as Florida for more than 12,000 years before the time of first contact with Europeans.  However, the indigenous Floridians had largely died out by the early 18th century.  Some Apalachees migrated to Louisiana, where their descendants now live, some were taken to Cuba and Mexico by the Spanish in the 18th century, and a few may have been absorbed into the Seminole and Miccosukee tribes.The High Commission of Australia in London is the diplomatic mission of Australia in the United Kingdom.  It is located in Australia House, a Grade II listed building.  It is both Australia's first diplomatic mission and the longest continuously occupied diplomatic mission in the United Kingdom. A diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from one state or an organisation present in another state to represent the sending state/organisation officially in the receiving state.  In practice, a diplomatic mission usually denotes the resident mission, namely the embassy, which is the office of a country's diplomatic representatives in the capital city of another country, whereas consulates are diplomatic missions which are not performed in the capital of the receiving state.  As well as being a diplomatic mission to the country in which it is situated, it may also be a non-resident permanent mission to one or more other countries.  There are thus resident and non-resident embassies. A diplomatic bag, also known as a diplomatic pouch, is a container with certain legal protections used for carrying official correspondence or other items between a diplomatic mission and its home government or other diplomatic, consular, or otherwise official entities.  The physical concept of a diplomatic bag is flexible and therefore can take many forms (e.g., a cardboard box, briefcase, duffel bag, large suitcase, crate or even a shipping container).  Additionally, a diplomatic bag usually has some form of lock and/or tamper-evident seal attached to it in order to deter or detect interference by unauthorized third parties.  The most important point is that as long as it is externally marked to show its status, the bag has diplomatic immunity from search or seizure, as codified in article 27 of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.  It may only contain articles intended for official use.  It is often escorted by a diplomatic courier, who is similarly immune from arrest and detention. The Embassy of China in London is the diplomatic mission of China in the United Kingdom.  The Embassy in London is China's only embassy in the UK, alongside two Consulates-General in Edinburgh and Manchester.  Established in 1877 as the Chinese Legation, the London mission was China's first permanent overseas diplomatic mission.  It has served as the diplomatic mission of the Qing Empire, Republic of China and (since 1950) the People's Republic of China.  It was the location of the Qing Empire's detention of Sun Yat-sen, an important episode in the Chinese revolution of 1911.  It remains today the focal point for events relating to China held in the United Kingdom, including celebrations in 2012 to commemorate 40 years of diplomatic relations between the UK and the People's Republic of China."}], "output": "  Alvaro Mexia had a diplomatic mission with the Ais Native population.**"},

Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional? \n\n Passage: Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981) , was a decision of the United States Supreme Court holding that the practice of requiring only men to register for the draft was constitutional.  After extensive hearings, floor debate and committee sessions on the matter, the United States Congress enacted the law, as it had previously been, to apply to men only.  Several attorneys, including Robert L. Goldberg, subsequently challenged the gender distinction as unconstitutional.  (The named defendant is Bernard D. Rostker, Director of the Selective Service System.)  In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court held that this gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and that the Act would stand as passed. Conscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars).  The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.  However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed.The 2010 Kiev Victory Day Parade was held on May 9, 2010 in Kiev, honoring the 65th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in the Great Patriotic War.

The oldest published recipe for the Gibson is found in the 1908 book, The World's Drinks And How To Mix Them by William Boothby. Zurracapote (sometimes abbreviated as zurra) is a popular Spanish alcoholic mixed drink, similar to sangría.  It consists of red wine mixed with fruit such as peaches and lemons, sugar, and cinnamon.  The concoction is then traditionally left to steep for several days, though some recipes call for the addition of other alcoholic beverages, juices, and fruit extracts.  The result is a mild-to-medium alcoholic drink, similar to sangría.Phillips Distilling Company (est. 1912) is a Minneapolis, Minnesota-based distillery and house brand of liquors known for its omnipresence in the bars, taverns, and private shelves of the Great Plains.  Brands such as UV Vodka and Prairie Vodka are becoming popular across the nation.  Phillips produces a variety of liquors such as Vodka, Gin, Rum, Canadian whisky, Brandy and many flavors of Schnapps.  In recent years, Phillips has branched out beyond standard liquors with a variety of specialty drinks, such as Revel Stoke Spiced Whisky (the original spiced whisky), Gin-Ka (a combination of gin and vodka), Phillips Union Whiskey, the 100 proof series of Schnapps (Hot, Blue, and Root Beer), and vodka such as UV Vodka and the handcrafted and organic Prairie Vodka.

Flaming beverages include cocktails and other mixed drinks that contain flammable, high-proof alcohol, which is ignited prior to consumption.  The alcohol may be an integral part of the drink, or it may be floated as a thin layer across the top of the drink.  The flames are mostly for dramatic flair.  However, in combination with certain ingredients, the flavor of the drink is altered.  Some flavors are enhanced, and it may impart a toasted flavor to some drinks.

Anani ben Sason (also called 'Anani, 'Inani, and 'Inyani) was a Jewish Talmudist who lived in the Land of Israel, known as an amora of the third century, a contemporary of R. Ammi.  He rarely discussed Halakot, and his discussions of them were not original (Shab.  64b).  Once he recited a Halakah in the patriarch's mansion, without naming its author, which provoked R. Ammi to ask: Is it his own?  It is what R. Eleazar had reported in the name of R. Oshaiah (M. Ḳ.  24b).  In the Haggadah, he sometimes reported the sayings of others, but more often he was original.  Thus, as a reason for the juxtaposition of the regulations regarding the sacrificial rites and the priestly vestments (Ex.  xxviii-xxix), he points out that the priestly vestments were to have atoning effects as well as the sacrifices.  He represents the miter as atoning for haughtiness, and cites R. Chanina as saying, That which rests highest on the priest atones for one's considering himself high; and similarly with the rest of the priestly garments (Zeb.  88b;  'Ar.  16a; compare Yer.  Yoma, vii.  44b; Lev.  R. x.).

Centered on the town of El Nacimiento in Múzquiz Municipality, the group are descendants of Black Seminoles escaping the threat of slavery in the United States. The Black Seminoles are black Indians associated with the Seminole people in Florida and Oklahoma.  They are the descendants of free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida.  Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole.  Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes, including the right to bear arms.Dhoolpet is one of the old suburbs in Hyderabad, India.  It is part of the old city of Hyderabad.  This place is inhabited by people who migrated from Uttar Pradesh during the Nizam rule.  The Nizam helped these people settle in this area.  The area is notorious for bootlegging and has witnessed attacks on policemen or excise department officials during raids. Seminole music is the music of the Seminole people, an indigenous people of the Americas who formed in Florida in the 18th century.  Today most live in Oklahoma, but a minority continue in Florida.  They have three federally recognized tribes, and some people belong to bands outside those groups.  Their traditional music includes extensive use of rattles, hand drums, water drums, and flutes. The Seminole are a Native American people originally from Florida.  Today, they principally live in Oklahoma with a minority in Florida, and comprise three federally recognized tribes: the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, as well as independent groups.  The Seminole nation emerged in a process of ethnogenesis from various Native American groups who settled in Florida in the 18th century, most significantly northern Muscogee (Creeks) from what is now Georgia and Alabama.  The word Seminole is derived from the Creek word simanó-li, which may be itself be derived from the Spanish word cimarrón, menaning runaway or wild one. The history of draining and development of the Everglades dates back to the 19th century.  During the Second Seminole War beginning in 1836, the United States military's mission was to seek out Seminole people in the Everglades and capture or kill them.  Those missions gave the military the opportunity to map land that seemed to frustrate and confound them at every turn.  A national push for expansion and progress toward the latter part of the 19th century stimulated interest in draining the Everglades for agricultural use.  According to historians, From the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, the United States went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned.  Indeed, it was considered the proper thing to do."}], "output": "  The descendants of the group of black Indians associated with the Seminole people settled in Oklahoma.**"},

The film was shot on location around Oak Creek Canyon near Sedona, AZ, and at the Montezuma Castle National Monument near Sedona.  The local Yavapai Indians, who were employed as extras on the production, refused to enter the cliff-dwellings because they represented the dwelling place of the dead.  Consequently, production was delayed while a band of Navajos was brought in from a reservation 137 miles away to replace them. Montezuma Castle National Monument protects a set of well-preserved dwellings located in Camp Verde, Arizona which were built and used by the Sinagua people, a pre-Columbian culture closely related to the Hohokam and other indigenous peoples of the southwestern United States, between approximately 1100 and 1425 AD.

It was typically used as a filling in Royal Navy armour-piercing shells during the early part of the 20th century. Picric acid is an organic compound with the formula (ON)CHOH.  Its IUPAC name is 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP).  The name picric comes from the Greek πικρός (pikros), meaning bitter, reflecting its bitter taste.  It is one of the most acidic phenols.  Like other highly nitrated organic compounds, picric acid is an explosive, which was once its primary use.  It has also been used in medicine (antiseptic, burn treatments) and dyes.Isopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name propan-2-ol), also called dimethyl carbinol or, incorrectly, isopropanol, is a compound with the chemical formula CHO or CHOH or CHCHOHCH (sometimes represented as i-PrOH).  It is a colorless, flammable chemical compound with a strong odor.  As a propyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms, sometimes shown as (CH)CHOH.  It is a structural isomer of 1-propanol.  It has a wide variety of industrial and household uses, and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants and detergents. Alcohol is any organic compound in which a hydroxyl functional group (-OH) is bound to a carbon atom, usually connected to other carbon or hydrogen atoms.  An important class are the simple acyclic alcohols, the general formula for which is CHOH.

Articles related to alcohol include: Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride (THPC) is an organophosphorus compound with the chemical formula [P(CHOH)]Cl.  The cation P(CHOH) is four-coordinate, as is typical for phosphonium salts. THPC has applications as a precursor to fire-retardant materials. 1-Hexanol is an organic alcohol with a six-carbon chain and a condensed structural formula of CH(CH)OH.  This colorless liquid is slightly soluble in water, but miscible with diethyl ether and ethanol.  Two additional straight chain isomers of 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, exist, both of which differing by the location of the hydroxyl group.  Many isomeric alcohols have the formula CHOH.

She attended Oxford University and was the first American woman to be awarded a degree with first-class honors after studying at St Hilda's College, Oxford.  She has been described as a seminal influence on second-wave feminism, and is best known for her book Sexual Politics (1970), which was based on her doctoral dissertation at Columbia University.  Journalist Liza Featherstone attributes previously unimaginable legal abortion, greater professional equality between the sexes, and a sexual freedom being made possible partially due to Millett's efforts.

The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1884 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880.  It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion. The Reading Post (until 2009, the Reading Evening Post), was an English local newspaper covering Reading, Berkshire and surrounding areas.  The title page of the paper featured the Maiwand Lion, a famous local landmark at Forbury Gardens.  The paper was most recently published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd., a division of Trinity Mirror plc.Kargil War Memorial, also known as the Vijaypath, is a war memorial built by the Indian Army, located in Dras, in the foothills of the Tololing Hill.  The memorial is located about 5 km from the city centre across the Tiger Hill.  It is located on the Srinagar-Leh National Highway 1D.  The memorial is in the memory of the soldiers and officers of the Indian Army who were killed during the 1999 conflict between India and Pakistan.  The conflict later became known as the Kargil War.  The memorial has a huge epitaph with names of all the officers and soldiers who died in war.  Kargil Vijay Diwas is celebrated on 26 July every year at the memorial simultaneously the Prime Minister of India pays tribute to the soldiers at Amar Jawan Jyothi at the India Gate, New Delhi. The main attraction of the whole memorial is the Sandstone wall, in the open, which has the names of all the Indian army personnel, who laid their lives during the Kargil war besides there is also a souvenir shop.  Visitors to the memorial can also see from there, some of the peaks that the Indian army captured back from Pakistan.

It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city.  The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds.  After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead.  The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.  A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials—the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens. Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England.  Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities—the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922.  The committee quickly raised £10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial.  The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community.  The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.  Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ. The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England.  Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial.  Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose.  Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument.  The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds."}], "output": "  The English local newspaper, featuring the sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, changed names to the Reading Post (until 2009) and then to Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd.

He was a son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the eponym of Clann Domhnaill, a branch of Clann Somhairle.  Aonghus Mór appears to have succeeded his father in the mid part of the thirteenth century.  At the time, the rulers of the Isles were fiercely independent of the Scottish Crown, and owed nominal allegiance to the distant Norwegian Crown.  Aonghus Mór's first certain appearance in the historical record seems to evince his involvement in aiding native Irish kindreds against the consolidation of Anglo-Irish authority in the north-west Ireland.  Such cooperation could have been undertaken in the context of overseas kindreds like Clann Domhnaill constructing Irish alliances to gain assistance against Scottish encroachment. The Kingdom of the Isles comprised the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde and the Isle of Man from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD.  The islands were known to the Norse as the Suðreyjar, or Southern Isles as distinct from the Norðreyjar or Northern Isles of Orkney and Shetland.  The historical record is incomplete, and the kingdom was not a continuous entity throughout the entire period.  The islands concerned are sometimes referred to as the Kingdom of Mann and the Isles, although only some of the later rulers claimed that title.  At times the rulers were independent of external control, although for much of the period they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland or Orkney.  At times there also appear to have been competing claims for all or parts of the territory.  The islands involved have a total land area of over 8300 km2 and extend for more than 500 km from north to south.Lord of Islay was a thirteenth- and fourteenth-century title borne by the chiefs of Clann Domhnaill before they assumed the title Lord of the Isles in the late fourteenth century.  The first person regarded to have styled themself Lord of Islay is Aonghus Mór, son of the eponymous ancestor of the clan, Domhnall mac Raghnaill.  The designation of Islay was frequently used by these lords and later members of the clan. Forests in Himachal Pradesh currently cover an area of nearly 37,691 sqkm , which is about 38.3% of the total land area of the state.  The forests were once considered to be the main source of income of the state and most of the original forests were clear felled.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.  Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.  In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as Beatlemania, and as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. David Bruce Spizer (born July 2, 1955) is a tax attorney in New Orleans, Louisiana, who is also recognized as an expert on The Beatles.  He has published eight books, and is frequently quoted as an authority on the history of the band and its recordings.Marsha Albert (born 1948) is credited with being the person who jump-started the early 1960s phenomena known as Beatlemania in the United States when as a 15-year-old girl, on 17 December 1963, she introduced for the first time on American radio a song written and recorded by The Beatles titled I Want to Hold Your Hand (the Beatles' best-selling single worldwide), and that Beatles historian and author Bruce Spizer noted, in 2004, by his stating Marsha Albert's actions forced a major record company to push up the release date of a debut single from an unknown band during the holiday season, a time when record companies traditionally released no new product. Cargo Records was a Canadian independent record label and distributor, active in the 1980s and 1990s.  Based in Montreal, the company both released albums directly as a label, and distributed albums on behalf of many other small independent labels, making it one of the largest and most influential Canadian record companies of the alternative rock era. Azra was a rock band that was popular across Yugoslavia in the 1980s.  Azra was formed in 1977 by its frontman Branimir Johnny Štulić.  The other two members of the original line-up were Mišo Hrnjak (bass) and Boris Leiner (drums).  The band is named after a verse from Der Asra by Heinrich Heine.  They are considered to be one of the most influential bands from the former Yugoslav new wave rock era and the Yugoslav rock scene in general. The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961.  The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine.  Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era.  The group, led by their principal songwriter and producer Brian, pioneered novel approaches to popular music form and production, combining their affinities for jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound.  He later arranged his compositions for studio orchestras and explored a variety of other styles, often incorporating classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways."}], "output": "  Bruce Spizer is an expert on The Beatles.**"},

The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the American League (AL) East division.  As one of the AL's original eight charter franchises when the league was established in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis, Missouri to become the St. Louis Browns.  After 52 often-beleaguered years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney/civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. The team's current majority owner is lawyer Peter Angelos. Marcus Wayne Garland (born October 26, 1950) is a retired American right-handed pitcher who spent nine seasons from 1973 to 1981 in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Baltimore Orioles (1973–1976) and Cleveland Indians (1977–1981).  He was one of 24 ballplayers who profited from the advent of MLB free agency following the 1976 season.  A torn rotator cuff rendered his playing career into a cautionary tale of the risks of signing pitchers to free-agent contracts of seven years or longer.  The article outlined how Garland was constantly criticized by Cleveland's incompetent management for not living up to his contract (even though his decline in performance was entirely due to a serious arm injury that could not be fixed effectively by mid-1970's sports medicine) and had fans savagely booing him and even vandalizing his car during games.The Washington Senators baseball team was one of the American League's eight charter franchises.  The club was founded in Washington, D.C. in as the Washington Senators.  In , the team changed its official name to the Washington Nationals.  The name Nationals appeared on the uniforms for only two seasons, and was then replaced with the W logo for the next 52 years.  However, the names Senators, Nationals and shorter Nats were used interchangeably by fans and media for the next sixty years; in , the latter two names were revived for the current National League franchise that had previously played in Montreal.  For a time, from 1911 to 1933, the Senators were one of the more successful franchises in Major League Baseball.  The team's rosters included Baseball Hall of Fame members Goose Goslin, Sam Rice, Joe Cronin, Bucky Harris, Heinie Manush and one of the greatest players and pitchers of all time, Walter Johnson.  But the Senators are remembered more for their many years of mediocrity and futility, including six last-place finishes in the 1940s and 1950s.  Joe Judge, Cecil Travis, Buddy Myer, Roy Sievers and Eddie Yost were other notable Senators players whose careers were spent in obscurity due to the team's lack of success. The Minnesota Twins are an American professional baseball team based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and play in the Central Division of Major League Baseball's American League.  The team is named after the Twin Cities area of Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota.  One of the American League's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Kansas City, Kansas in 1894 as the Kansas City Blues before moving to Washington, D.C. and renamed Senators.  In 1905 the team changed its official name to the Washington Nationals.  The name Nationals would appear on the uniforms for only 2 seasons, and would then be replaced with the W logo for the next 52 years.  The media often shortened the nickname to Nats.  Many fans and newspapers (especially out-of-town papers) persisted in using the Senators nickname.  Over time, Nationals faded as a nickname, and Senators became dominant.  Baseball guides would list the club's nickname as Nationals or Senators, acknowledging the dual-nickname situation.  In 1961, the Senators relocated to Minnesota and were renamed the Twins. The Detroit Tigers are an American professional baseball team based in Detroit, Michigan.  The Tigers compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) Central division.  One of the AL's eight charter franchises, the club was founded in Detroit in 1901 .

Its output is 6 to 10 candela, brighter than that of earlier lamps.  Its more complete combustion of the candle wick and oil than in other lamps required much less frequent trimming of the wick. The Lewis lamp is a type of light fixture used in lighthouses.  It was invented by Winslow Lewis who patented the design in 1810.  The primary marketing point of the Lewis lamp was that it used less than half the oil of the prior oil lamps which they replaced.  The lamp used a similar design to an Argand lamp, adding a parabolic reflector behind the lamp and a magnifying lens made from 4 in green bottle glass in front of the lamp.  A similar variant using a parabolic reflector was created by the inventor of the Argand lamp, Aimé Argand.  While the Argand variant became widely used by European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp design was selected by the United States for use in American lighthouses.A hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is type of cold cathode lamp used in physics and chemistry as a spectral line source (e.g. for atomic absorption spectrometers) and as a frequency tuner for light sources such as lasers.  An HCL takes advantage of the hollow cathode effect, which causes conduction at a lower voltage and with more current than a cold cathode lamp that does not have a hollow cathode. Antoine Quinquet was a French pharmacist who was born in Soissons on 9 March 1745.  In 1760 he was apprenticed to an apothecary in Soissons and in 1777 he moved to Paris where he worked for Antoine Baumé.  He travelled to Geneva, where he met Aimé Argand.  In 1779, he returned to Paris and opened his own pharmacy there. A kerosene lamp (usually called a paraffin lamp in some countries) is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene (paraffin) as a fuel.  Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting.  Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats.  There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat wick, central draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp.  Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast variants. A glow switch starter is a type of preheat starter used with fluorescent lamp.  It is commonly filled with neon gas or argon gas and contains a bimetallic strip and a stationary electrode.  The operating principle is simple, when current is applied, the gas inside ionizes and heats a bimetallic strip which in turn bends toward the stationary electrode thus shorting the starter between the electrodes of the fluorescent lamp After a second the starter's bimetallic strip will cool and open the circuit between the electrodes and the process repeats until the lamp has lit.  One disadvantage of glow switch starters is that when the lamp is at the end of its life it will continuously blink on and off until the glow switch starter wears out or an electrode on the fluorescent lamp burns out."}], "output": "  The lamp used in many lighthouses is similar to the Argand lamp, which was patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand.**"},

Orvar Bergmark (16 November 1930 – 10 May 2004) was a Swedish football defender and manager.  He was the second Swedish national manager ever, and managed to qualify the Swedish national football team for the FIFA World Cup in Mexico 1970, after having beaten France (among others) in the qualifications.  The 1970 World Cup was the first one in 12 years, and it was also the first time in 20 years that Sweden had qualified for a World Cup.  (Sweden hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup, and hence did not need to qualify.)  Sweden did not qualify for the World Cups in 1954, 1962 and 1966). The 2002 FIFA World Cup was the 17th staging of the FIFA World Cup which took place from 31 May to 30 June 2002 in South Korea and Japan.

It was fought by American and Filipino forces against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.  The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of over 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting in the Pacific theater.  Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle.  Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's foundation.  The battle ended the almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines (1942–1945).  The city's capture was marked as General Douglas MacArthur's key to victory in the campaign of reconquest. The Seven Days Battles were a series of six major battles over the seven days from June 25 to July 1, 1862, near Richmond, Virginia, during the American Civil War.  Confederate General Robert E. Lee drove the invading Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula.  The series of battles is sometimes known erroneously as the Seven Days Campaign, but it was actually the culmination of the Peninsula Campaign, not a separate campaign in its own right.The following Confederate States Army units and commanders fought in the Seven Days Battles (from June 25 to July 1, 1862) of the American Civil War.  Order of battle compiled from the army organization during the battle, the casualty returns and the reports.  The Union order of battle is listed separately.

Order of battle compiled from the army organization-return of casualties during the battle and the reports.  The Confederate order of battle is listed separately. The Battle of Cross Keys was fought on June 8, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, as part of Confederate Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.  Together, the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic the following day were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia. The Battle of Gaines's Mill, sometimes known as the First Battle of Cold Harbor or the Battle of Chickahominy River, took place on June 27, 1862, in Hanover County, Virginia, as the third of the Seven Days Battles (Peninsula Campaign) of the American Civil War.  Following the inconclusive Battle of Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville) the previous day, Confederate General Robert E. Lee renewed his attacks against the right flank of the Union Army, relatively isolated on the northern side of the Chickahominy River.  There, Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps had established a strong defensive line behind Boatswain's Swamp.  Lee's force was destined to launch the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions.  Porter's reinforced V Corps held fast for the afternoon as the Confederates attacked in a disjointed manner, first with the division of Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill, then Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, suffering heavy casualties.  The arrival of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's command was delayed, preventing the full concentration of Confederate force before Porter received some reinforcements from the VI Corps."}], "output": "  The Seven Days Battles were fought earlier in our nation's history than the Battle of Manila. The Seven Days Battles took place in June 1862, during the American Civil War, while the Battle of Manila occurred in February and March 1945, during World War II.

It was originally sung by Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, and also is featured in the Cameron Mackintosh/Disney Mary Poppins musical.  The song can be heard in the Mary Poppins scene of The Great Movie Ride at Disney's Hollywood Studios and during the Mary Poppins segment of  at Disneyland. The Great Movie Ride was a dark ride attraction located at Disney's Hollywood Studios in the Walt Disney World Resort.  The attraction employed the use of Audio-Animatronic figures, practical sets, live actors, special effects, and projections to recreate iconic scenes from twelve classic films throughout motion picture history.  The attraction—which debuted with the park on May 1, 1989—was located inside a replica of Grauman's Chinese Theatre, one of Hollywood's most famous movie palaces.I Love to Laugh, also called We Love to Laugh, is a song from Walt Disney's film Mary Poppins.  It was composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The song is sung in the film by Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn), and Bert (Dick Van Dyke) as they levitate uncontrollably toward the ceiling, eventually joined by Mary Poppins (Julie Andrews) herself.  The premise of the scene, that laughter and happiness cause Uncle Albert (and like-minded visitors) to float into the air, can be seen as a metaphor for the way laughter can lighten a mood.  (Compare Peter Pan's flight power, which is also powered by happy thoughts.)  Conversely, thinking of something sad literally brings Albert and his visitors down to earth again.  The song states a case strongly in favor of laughter, even if Mary Poppins appears to disapprove of Uncle Albert's behavior, especially since it not only complicates the task of getting Albert down, but the infectious mood sends Bert and the Banks children into the air as well. Step In Time is a song and dance number from Walt Disney's 1964 film Mary Poppins, and it is composed by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The choreography for this song was provided by Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood.  It is sung by Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and the other chimney sweeps on the rooftops of London.  In the first part of the song, the lines he says in the verses are Kick your knees up, 'Round the chimney, Flap like a birdie, Up on the railing, Over the rooftops and Link your elbows followed by an interlude.  The interlude continues with Bert, Mary Poppins, Michael, Jane and all the chimney sweepers dancing around the rooftops and as Admiral Boom looks at them with the telescope, he thinks that they're Hottentots, so he orders Mr. Binnacle to make them scram with colorful fireworks.  In the second part, as all the chimney sweepers get in the house of George Banks, Mrs. Brill walks into the living room looking at them and screams, They're at it again!  and she runs away trying to strike one of the chimney sweepers with a frying pan.  As Jane, Michael, Mary Poppins and Bert get in the same place, Ellen runs around the dining room with an OW!  and the chimney sweepers flip her.  The other phrases in the rest of the musical number are Votes for women, It's the master, and What's all this? My Kind of Town or My Kind of Town (Chicago Is) is a popular song composed by Jimmy Van Heusen, with lyrics by Sammy Cahn.  It was originally part of the musical score for Robin and the 7 Hoods, a 1964 musical film starring several members of the Rat Pack.  It was nominated for the 1964 Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost to Chim Chim Cher-ee from Mary Poppins.  Although the song predated the Grammy Award Best Original Song for a Motion Picture category, the entire score was nominated for the 1964 Grammy Award in the category Best Original Score Written for A Motion Picture, but it lost to the eponymously titled Mary Poppins score. A Man Has Dreams is a song from Walt Disney's film Mary Poppins, written by Richard M. Sherman and Robert B. Sherman.  The song melody is a slowed down version of The Life I Lead which serves as Banks's leitmotif as he was fired.  In both the motion picture and the stage musical, the song is performed as a conversational duet between Bert, the chimney sweep (Dick Van Dyke) and George Banks (David Tomlinson).  It is operatic in nature, sung dialogue, and was highly unusual for a musical film of that era.  The song incorporates a reprise of A Spoonful of Sugar which is Mary Poppins's leitmotif."}], "output": "  Sure! The answer to your question is:\n\n1964.**"},

Australia also lodged a bid for the 2018 World Cup, but withdrew the bid on 10 June 2010.  The 2018 and 2022 World Cups will be the 21st and 22nd editions of the FIFA World Cup.  The bidding procedure to host both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest.  The bid was presented by Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley, Quentin Bryce and Elle Macpherson.  However, due to controversies of Qatar hosting, Australia's bid is possible if FIFA decides to strip Qatar's 2022 hosting rights.The Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid was a bid by Qatar to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.  The bid has come under FBI investigation for bribery and corruption, leading to the resignation of FIFA President Sepp Blatter.  With a population of 2 million people, Qatar will be the first Arab state to host the World Cup. Russia announced its intent to bid for the FIFA World Cup in early 2009, and submitted its request to FIFA in time.

In country music, walkdown is a bassline which connects two root position chords whose roots are a third apart, often featuring an inverted chord to go between the root notes of the first two chords.  See: slash chord.  A walkup would be the converse.  For example the chords G Major and E minor (a minor third apart) may be joined by an intervening chord to create stepwise motion in the bass: G-D/F♯ -Em (I-V6/4-vi).  The second chord, D Major, is performed with its third note, the F#, in the bass.  Walkdowns may be performed by the upright bass player, the electric bass player, the guitarist, or a piano player.

The film was co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Mayhem Pictures.  Based on the true story of a 1987 cross country team from a mainly Latino high school in McFarland, California, the film stars Kevin Costner as Jim White, the school's coach, who leads the team to win a state championship.

The remains, NMMNH P-18400, consist of a tibia, vertebrae, and fragments, and came from the ? late Carnian-age Upper Triassic Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation, near Fort Wingate.  Andrew Heckert, in his unpublished thesis, proposed the name Cinizasaurus hunti for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauriformes. Sphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada.  To date, three species have been described: the type species, S. goodwini, from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; S. buchholtzae, from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and S. edmontonense, from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.  The etymology of Sphaerotholus is a combination of the Greek sphaira, meaning ball, and tholos, meaning dome, and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull.  The survival of Sphaerotholus from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8 million years) and a widespread distribution.  Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.  Sphaerotholus is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur. Oryctodromeus (meaning digging runner) was a genus of small ornithopod dinosaur.  Fossils are known from the middle Cretaceous Blackleaf Formation of southwestern Montana and the Wayan Formation of southeastern Idaho, USA, both of the Cenomanian stage, roughly 95 million years ago.  A member of the small, presumably fast-running herbivorous family Thescelosauridae, Oryctodromeus is the first dinosaur published that shows evidence of burrowing behavior. Cryptoraptor (meaning secret thief) is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a dinosaur.  The remains, NMMNH P-17375, consist of a fragmentary skeleton including vertebrae, a pubis, and parts of the thigh bones.  This specimen came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation in Quay County.  Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name Cryptoraptor lockleyi for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).

AD 43) was a historical king of the British Catuvellauni tribe at the time of the Roman conquest.  He can probably be identified with the legendary British king Guiderius. The Catuvellauni were a Celtic tribe or state of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, attested by inscriptions into the 4th century.Romano-British culture is the culture that arose in Britain under the Roman Empire following the Roman conquest in AD 43 and the creation of the province of Britannia.  It arose as a fusion of the imported Roman culture with that of the indigenous Britons, a people of Celtic language and custom.  It survived the 5th century Roman departure from Britain.  Scholars such as Christopher Snyder believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries – approximately from AD 410 when the Roman legions withdrew, to AD 597 when St Augustine of Canterbury arrived – southern Britain preserved an active sub-Roman culture that survived the attacks from the Anglo-Saxons and even used a vernacular Latin when writing. The history of Wales begins with the arrival of human beings in the region thousands of years ago.  Neanderthals lived in what is now Wales, or Cymru in Welsh, at least 230,000 years ago, while Homo sapiens arrived by about 31,000 BC.  However, continuous habitation by modern humans dates from the period after the end of the last ice age around 9000 BC, and Wales has many remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age.  During the Iron Age the region, like all of Britain south of the Firth of Forth, was dominated by the Celtic Britons and the Brittonic language.  The Romans, who began their conquest of Britain in AD 43, first campaigned in what is now northeast Wales in 48 against the Deceangli, and gained total control of the region with their defeat of the Ordovices in 79.  The Romans departed from Britain in the 5th century, opening the door for the Anglo-Saxon invasion.  Thereafter Brittonic language and culture began to splinter, and several distinct groups formed.  The Welsh people were the largest of these groups, and are generally discussed independently of the other surviving Brittonic-speaking peoples after the 11th century. The Durotriges were one of the Celtic tribes living in Britain prior to the Roman invasion.  The tribe lived in modern Dorset, south Wiltshire, south Somerset and Devon east of the River Axe and the discovery of an Iron Age hoard in 2009 at Shalfleet, Isle of Wight gives evidence that they lived in the western half of the island.  After the Roman conquest, their main civitates, or settlement-centred administrative units, were Durnovaria (modern Dorchester, the probable original capital) and Lindinis (modern Ilchester, whose former, unknown status was thereby enhanced).  Their territory was bordered to the west by the Dumnonii; and to the east by the Belgae. The Corieltauvi (formerly thought to be called the Coritani, and sometimes referred to as the Corieltavi) were a tribe of people living in Britain prior to the Roman conquest, and thereafter a civitas of Roman Britain.  Their territory was in what is now the English East Midlands.  They were bordered by the Brigantes to the north, the Cornovii to the west, the Dobunni and Catuvellauni to the south, and the Iceni to the east.  Their capital was called Ratae Corieltauvorum, known today as Leicester."}], "output": "  The Celtic ruler who was born in AD 43 ruled southeastern Britain prior to the conquest by the Romans.**"},

LaValle (born May 22, 1939 in Brooklyn, New York) represents District 1 in the New York State Senate, which comprises the five East End towns of Long Island, New York, and the eastern half of the Town of Brookhaven, New York.  First elected in 1976, he is the chair of the Higher Education Committee in the State Senate. New York's 1st State Senate district is one of 62 districts of the New York State Senate.  It is currently represented by Senator Kenneth LaValle (R).New York's 2nd State Senate district is one of 62 districts of the New York State Senate.  It is currently represented by John J. Flanagan (R).  Senator Flanagan is New York State Senate's majority leader and temporary president. Nesting is the delimitation of voting districts for one elected body in order to define the voting districts for another body.  For example, in California, the State Assembly (the lower house) is composed of 80 members, each one representing 1/80th of California's population, and the State Senate (the upper house) is composed of 40 members, each one representing 1/40th of California's population.  In this case, the process of nesting could either be first defining the 80 Assembly districts, and then defining the Senate districts as a merge of two Assembly districts, or first defining the 40 Senate districts, and then creating the Assembly districts by splitting each Senate district into two.  If the Assembly districts and the Senate districts are created independently of each other, then the process of nesting is not used. The California State Senate is the upper house of the California State Legislature.  Due to the state's large population and relatively small legislature, the State Senate has the largest population per representative ratio of any state legislative house.  In the United States House of Representatives, California is apportioned 53 representatives, each representing approximately 704,566 people, while in the State Senate, each of the 40 Senators represents approximately 931,349 people, with the result that California state senators each actually represent more voters than California's representatives to the United States Congress do.  Each member roughly represents a population equivalent to the state of Delaware.  As a result of Proposition 140 in 1990 and Proposition 28 in 2012, members elected to the legislature prior to 2012 are restricted by term limits to two four-year terms (eight years), while those elected in or after 2012 are allowed to serve 12 years in the legislature in any combination of four-year state senate or two-year state assembly terms.

The Frisian settlers on the coast of South Jutland (today's Northern Friesland) also spoke Old Frisian but no medieval texts of this area are known.  The language of the earlier inhabitants of the region between the Zuiderzee and Ems River (the Frisians mentioned by Tacitus) is attested in only a few personal names and place-names.  Old Frisian evolved into Middle Frisian, spoken from the 16th to the 19th century. The Leda is a river in north-western Germany in the state of Lower Saxony.  It is a right tributary of the Ems and originates at the confluence of the Sagter Ems and the Soeste (Dreyschloot) near the town of Barßel.  The Leda flows into the Ems near the town of Leer.  On the southern bank of the Leda, in the Overledingen Land (Overledingen=country over the Leda), opposite Leer, lies the small settlement of Kloster Muhde (Muhde from the Old Frisian mutha meaning (river) mouth).  The total length of the river is 29 km , of which the lower 1.9 km are navigable for sea-going vessels.German (Deutsch ] ) is a West Germanic language that is mainly spoken in Central Europe.  It is the most widely spoken and (co-) official language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein.  It is also one of the three official languages of Luxembourg.  The languages which are most similar to German are the other members of the West Germanic language branch: Afrikaans, Dutch, English, the Frisian languages, Low German/Low Saxon, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish.  German is the second most widely spoken Germanic language, after English. English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and is now a global lingua franca.  Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea.  It is closely related to the Frisian languages, but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages, particularly Norse (a North Germanic language), as well as by Latin and Romance languages, particularly French. Proto-Norse (also called Proto-Scandinavian, Primitive Norse, Proto-Nordic, Ancient Nordic, Ancient Scandinavian, Old Nordic, Old Scandinavian, Proto-North Germanic, North Proto-Germanic or Common Scandinavian) was an Indo-European language spoken in Scandinavia that is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of Proto-Germanic in the first centuries CE.  It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language attested in the oldest Scandinavian Elder Futhark inscriptions, spoken around from the 2nd to 8th centuries (corresponding to the late Roman Iron Age and the Germanic Iron Age).

Hatton Castle stands on the flanks of Hatton Hill above the village of Newtyle. Hatton Castle stands on the lower part of Hatton Hill, the most easterly of the Sidlaw Hills, to the south of Newtyle in Angus, Scotland.  The castle overlooks the wooded Den of Newtyle, and its views extend across Strathmore and include Ben Lawers and Schiehallion as well as the Angus and Glenshee hills.  The 16th-century castle was originally built in a typical Scottish Z plan tower house design, as a fortified country house or château.  There was an earlier castle called Balcraig Castle which stood less than half a mile from the present building, also on Hatton Hill.Angus cattle are naturally polled and solid black or red even though the udder may be white.  The native colour is black, but more recently red colours have emerged.

Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love. Within You Without You is a song written by George Harrison and released on the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after Love You To, and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September–October 1966.  Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle.  The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.  Although the song was his only composition on Sgt. Pepper, Harrison's endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover.Love Songs: A Compilation... Old and New is a compilation album by English musician Phil Collins.  The album was released by Atlantic Recording Corporation and Rhino Entertainment on 28 September 2004.  The album was released only a few months after the box set The Platinum Collection, which appeared earlier in the year (see 2004 in music). Sharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter.  Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy.  Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included.  Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures.  This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it.  If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views.  When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others.  You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances.  According to Gannon: How you treat others will determine how others treat you.  How others treat you will determine how you see yourself.  How you see yourself will determine who you are. English musician Syd Barrett recorded many songs during his short career as a musician.  One of the founding members of English rock band Pink Floyd, he was the dominant force of the band in their early years, writing most of the material found on their first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, contributing to their second one, A Saucerful of Secrets, and recording several unreleased songs with the band.  Due to increasing mental illness, Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 and was subsequently replaced by guitarist David Gilmour.  After Pink Floyd, Barrett would record two solo albums, both released in 1970, before Barrett left the music business entirely in 1972. No Plan is an extended play, comprising songs written and recorded by English musician David Bowie, released posthumously on 8 January 2017.  The release coincided with what would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, almost a year after his death.  No Plan compiles the original songs written for Bowie's Broadway musical, Lazarus, including the titular Lazarus, No Plan, Killing a Little Time, and When I Met You.  The songs were first recorded by the cast of the musical as part of its official soundtrack.  The recordings featured on No Plan come from the sessions for Bowie's twenty-fifth and final studio album Blackstar, with Lazarus appearing as the third track on the album.  Upon release, No Plan debuted at #138 on the Billboard 200.  The music video for the title track was also released in accompaniment with the EP.

The game was held in Columbus, Ohio, for the first time, at Nationwide Arena, home of the Columbus Blue Jackets.  The team captains were chosen by NHL Hockey Operations: Nick Foligno of the All-Star Game-hosting Blue Jackets served as captain for the home team, and Jonathan Toews of the Chicago Blackhawks served for the away team.

The Stanley Cup is a trophy awarded annually to the playoff champion club of the National Hockey League (NHL) ice hockey league.  It was donated by the Governor General of Canada Lord Stanley of Preston in 1892, and is the oldest professional sports trophy in North America.  Inscribed the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup, the trophy was first awarded to Canada's amateur ice hockey clubs who won the trophy as the result of challenge games and league play.  Professional clubs came to dominate the competition in the early years of the twentieth century, and in 1913 the two major professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) (forerunner of the NHL) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other in an annual series for the Stanley Cup.  After a series of league mergers and folds, it became the de facto championship trophy of the NHL in 1926, though it was nominally still subject to external challenge.  After 1947, the Cup became the de jure NHL championship prize. Frederick Doc Doherty (June 15, 1887 – February 12, 1961) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player.  Doherty played hockey for several professional ice hockey teams from 1908 until 1916, including a stint with the Toronto Ontarios in the National Hockey Association (NHA).  He also played in the Maritime Professional Hockey League and the Ontario Professional Hockey League.  After returning from World War I duty, he played one game in the National Hockey League with the Montreal Canadiens to end his career.

The series is noted for featuring early television appearances of several well known actors including Audrey Hepburn, James Dean and Grace Kelly. James Byron Dean (February 8, 1931 – September 30, 1955) was an American actor.  He is remembered as a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment and social estrangement, as expressed in the title of his most celebrated film, Rebel Without a Cause (1955), in which he starred as troubled teenager Jim Stark.  The other two roles that defined his stardom were loner Cal Trask in East of Eden (1955) and surly ranch hand Jett Rink in Giant (1956).Jack Grinnage (born January 20, 1931) is an American actor with a film and television career spanning seven decades.  Born in Los Angeles, Grinnage made his first television appearances in 1954.  The following year, he played as Moose – one of three teenage rebels who chase James Dean – in Rebel Without a Cause (1955).  Rebel Without a Cause was his first movie where he received a screen credit. Rebel Without a Pause is a song by hip hop group Public Enemy and the first single from their 1988 album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.  The title is a reference to the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause. This is also the first song to sample Funky Drummer. James Gilmore Backus (February 25, 1913 – July 3, 1989) was an American radio, television, film, and voice actor.  Among his most famous roles were the voice of nearsighted cartoon character Mr. Magoo, the rich Hubert Updike III on the radio version of The Alan Young Show, Joan Davis' character's husband (a domestic court judge) on TV's I Married Joan, James Dean's character's father in Rebel Without a Cause, and Thurston Howell III, on the 1960s sitcom Gilligan's Island.  He also starred in his own show of one season, The Jim Backus Show, also known as Hot Off the Wire. Rebel Highway was a short-lived revival of American International Pictures created and produced by Lou Arkoff, the son of Samuel Z. Arkoff and Debra Hill for the Showtime channel in 1994.  The concept was 10-week series of 1950s drive-in classic B-movies remade with a '90s edge.  The impetus for the series, according to Arkoff was, what it would be like if you made Rebel Without a Cause today.  It would be more lurid, sexier, and much more dangerous, and you definitely would have had Natalie Wood's top off.  Originally, Arkoff wanted to call the series, Raging Hormones but Showtime decided on Rebel Highway instead.  Arkoff and Hill invited several directors to pick a title from one of Samuel Arkoff's movies, hire their own writers and create a story that could resemble the original if they wanted.  In addition, they had the right to a final cut and select their own director of photography and the editor.  Each director was given a $1.3 million budget and 12 days to shoot it with a cast of young, up and coming actors and actresses.  According to Arkoff, the appeal to directors was that, They weren't hampered by big studios saying, 'You can't do this or that.'  And all the directors paid very close attention to the detail of the era.  We want these shows to be fun for the younger generation and fun for the older generation."}], "output": "  The series starring James Dean aired on CBS in 1955.**"},

It is a broad therapeutic concept.  It is defined by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society as an evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive intervention for patients with chronic respiratory diseases who are symptomatic and often have decreased daily life activities.  In general, pulmonary rehabilitation refers to a series of services that are administered to patients of respiratory disease and their families, typically to attempt to improve the quality of life for the patient.  Pulmonary rehabilitation may be carried out in a variety of settings, depending on the patient's needs, and may or may not include pharmacologic intervention.

Facebook, Inc., et al. is a class action lawsuit filed in California against Facebook alleging misappropriation of Facebook users' names and likenesses in advertisements called Sponsored Stories.  The case resulted in the parties reaching a settlement.  Settlement checks in the amount of $15.00 were distributed to class members beginning November 17, 2016. A liability insurance company's duty to settle is defined as an implied obligation to by the insurer to a policyholder and to a claimant to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.  To the surprise of many, a typical liability insurance policy makes no express contractual promise to settle.  In California, an insurer, who wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits.  A rationale for this duty is that [w]hen an offer is made to settle a claim in excess of policy limits for an amount within policy limits, a genuine and immediate conflict of interest arises between carrier and assured.  An insurer who denies coverage does so at its own risk.  Such factors as a belief that the policy does not provide coverage, should not affect a decision as to whether the settlement offer in question is a reasonable one.  It is the duty of the insurer to keep the insured informed of settlement offers.  [A]n insurer potentially can be liable for unreasonably coercing an insured to contribute to a settlement fund.

The 1999 Odisha cyclone organized into a tropical depression in the Andaman Sea on 25 October, though its origins could be traced back to an area of storms in the Sulu Sea four days prior.  The disturbance gradually strengthened as it took a west-northwesterly path, reaching cyclonic storm strength the next day.  Taking advantage of highly favorable conditions, the storm rapidly intensified, attaining super cyclonic storm intensity on 28 October before peaking with winds of 260 km/h (160 mph) and a record-low pressure of 912 mbar (hPa; 26.93 inHg).  The storm maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on 29 October.  The cyclone steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, remaining quasi-stationary for two days before slowly drifting offshore as a much weaker system; the storm dissipated on 1 November over the Bay of Bengal. Kathantara (Odia: କଥାନ୍ତର , English Another Story) is a 2007 Indian Oriya language disaster film directed by Himansu Khatua, a story of tribulations of the 1999 Odisha cyclone.Severe Tropical Cyclone Donna was the strongest off-season South Pacific tropical cyclone on record during the month of May.  The twenty-first tropical disturbance, third named storm, and second severe tropical cyclone of the annual cyclone season, Donna formed from an area of disturbed weather that was first monitored west-northwest of Fiji on 1 May 2017.  The disturbance drifted eastward amid an increasingly favorable environment, and it was designated Tropical Depression 21F late on 2 May.  Twelve hours later, it intensified into a Category 1 on the Australian tropical cyclone scale and was designated Tropical Cyclone Donna as the storm's motion shifted west and then south.  After reaching its initial peak as a Category 4 cyclone early on 6 May, the effects of wind shear and upwelling caused the storm to weaken.  However, it reintensified into a Category 5 cyclone on 8 May.  Soon after, Donna entered a region of strong westerly flow and began to rapidly weaken.  Continuing to accelerate in a southerly direction, Donna eventually weakened into a tropical low on 10 May.  By 16 May, Donna's remnants had fully dissipated. Severe Tropical Cyclone Anne was one of the most intense tropical cyclones within the South Pacific basin during the 1980s.  The cyclone was first noted on January 5, 1988 as a weak tropical depression to the northeast of Tuvalu, in conjunction with the future Typhoon Roy in the North-Western Pacific basin.  Over the next few days, the system gradually developed while moving southwestward.  Once it became a tropical cyclone, it was named Anne on January 8.  The next day, Anne rapidly intensified, becoming the fourth major tropical cyclone to affect Vanuatu within four years.  On January 11, Anne peaked in intensity while it was equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, and a Category 4 on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale.  After turning southward on January 12, Anne struck New Caledonia, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone to affect the French Overseas Territory.  The system subsequently weakened as it started to interact with Tropical Cyclone Agi.  Anne weakened into a depression and was last noted on January 14 to the south-east of New Caledonia. Intense Tropical Cyclone Hondo (JTWC designation: 16S) was the strongest and longest lived tropical cyclone to develop during the 2007–08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season.  The third tropical cyclone and first intense tropical cyclone of the season, Hondo developed out of a tropical disturbance in early February about 1,020 km (635 mi) east-southeast of Diego Garcia.  The disturbance quickly strengthened, becoming a moderate tropical storm on February 4 and a severe tropical storm the following day.  After a brief period of slower intensification, Hondo rapidly intensified into an intense tropical cyclone and reached its peak intensity with winds of 215 km/h (130 mph ) on February 7.  The cyclone gradually weakened over the next several days due to an increase in forward speed and a decrease in sea surface temperatures.  On February 12, Hondo rapidly degenerated into a remnant-low pressure area.  Over the following week, the remnant low traveled in a general west-northwest direction with no development.  On February 20, about 2,780 km (1,725 mi) northeast of where the final advisories were issued, the storm began to regenerate.  The next day, advisories were issued on Tropical Disturbance Ex-Hondo, which briefly strengthened into a tropical depression.  However, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center, Hondo continued to strengthen and attained winds of 95 km/h (60 mph ) before passing directly over Réunion.  Interaction with the island caused the storm to weaken and degenerate into a remnant low once more.  The storm dissipated on February 29 after executing a counterclockwise loop. The 2002–03 Australian region cyclone season included Cyclone Inigo, which tied Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin.  It began on 1 November 2002 and ended on 30 April 2003.  The regional tropical cyclone operational plan also defines a tropical cyclone year separately from a tropical cyclone season, which runs from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003.  These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Australian region, which is defined as in the southern hemisphere between 90°E and 180°E.  The season's ten tropical depressions existed within these dates, with the first, designated as Tropical Cyclone 07S, entering the basin on 27 December 2002.  The last system, Cyclone Epi, dissipated on 6 June 2003.  Tropical cyclones in this area were monitored by four Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres (TCWCs): the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane and one in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea."}], "output": "  The cyclone that had a film made about it in 2007 is Cyclone Hondo. **"},

Pavel Samuilovich Urysohn (Па́вел Самуи́лович Урысо́н ) (February 3, 1898 – August 17, 1924) was a Soviet mathematician of Jewish origin who is best known for his contributions in dimension theory, and for developing Urysohn's Metrization Theorem and Urysohn's Lemma, both of which are fundamental results in topology.  His name is also commemorated in the terms Urysohn universal space, Fréchet–Urysohn space, Menger–Urysohn dimension and Urysohn integral equation.  He and Pavel Alexandrov formulated the modern definition of compactness in 1923. In the mathematical field of topology, the Alexandroff extension is a way to extend a noncompact topological space by adjoining a single point in such a way that the resulting space is compact.  It is named for the Russian mathematician Pavel Alexandrov.

New Jersey earned more battle stars for combat actions than the other three completed Iowa-class battleships, and was the only US battleship providing gunfire support during the Vietnam War. Rear Adm. J. Edward Snyder, USN (Ret.)  (October 23, 1924 – November 4, 2007) was notable as the captain of the battleship USS New Jersey during that ship's deployment to the Vietnam War in 1968.  Considered by those serving on the New Jersey to be a sailor's captain, Captain Snyder was able to motivate his men through his more relaxed shipboard policies.Operation Market Time was the United States Navy and South Vietnam’s successful effort begun in 1965 to stop the flow of troops, war material, and supplies by sea, coast, and rivers, from North Vietnam into parts of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.  Also participating in Operation Market Time were United States Coast Guard Squadron One and Squadron Three.  The Coast Guard provided heavily armed 82 ft patrol boats and large cutters that included 5 cannons used in battle and gunfire support. USS Trippe (FF-1075) was a Knox-class frigate of the US Navy, built at Westwego, Louisiana, was commissioned in mid-September 1970.  In July 1971, following shakedown training in the Caribbean area and a surveillance mission off Haiti, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul and installation of the Basic Point Defense Missile System, which featured short-range Sea Sparrow guided missiles in an eight-round launcher on her afterdeck.  Trippe was the Navy's first destroyer-type ship to receive this later-widespread contribution to shipboard protection against air and missile attack.  The first months of 1972 were spent testing her new weapons and participating in exercises.  In June the ship passed through the Panama Canal en route to Southeast Asian waters, where she provided Vietnam War aircraft carrier escort and naval gunfire support services during July and August.  Trippe then went to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf areas, visiting many ports in a region that would see increasing U.S. Navy activity in the coming decades.  She returned to the U.S. East Coast in December 1972, after a deployment that had taken her completely around the World. The United States naval gunfire support debate is an ongoing debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and independent groups like the United States Naval Gunfire Support Association over what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role can best be provided.  At the heart of the issue is the role that naval gunfire support—the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range—should play in the U.S. Navy of the 21st century. Naval gunfire support (NGFS) (also known as shore bombardment) is the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range.  NGFS is one of a number of disciplines encompassed by the term Naval Fires.  Modern naval gunfire support is one of the three main components of amphibious warfare assault operations support, along with aircraft and ship-launched land-attack missiles. Shipborne guns have been used against shore defences since the early days of naval warfare."}], "output": "  The captain of the only battleship to provide gunfire support during the Vietnam War was Rear Adm.

As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies.  Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term.  Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age.  The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65.  Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies.

He was the son of Khosrau II. The Sasanian Empire ( or ), also known as the Sassanian, Sasanid, Sassanid or Neo-Persian Empire, known to its inhabitants as Ērānshahr in Middle Persian, was the last period of the Persian Empire (Iran) before the rise of Islam, named after the House of Sasan who ruled from 224 to 651 AD.  The Sasanian Empire, which succeeded the Parthian Empire, was recognised as one of the leading world powers alongside its neighbouring arch-rival the Roman-Byzantine Empire, for a period of more than 400 years.The Duchy of Thuringia was an eastern frontier march of the Merovingian kingdom of Austrasia, established about 631 by King Dagobert I after his troops had been defeated by the forces of the Slavic confederation of Samo at the Battle of Wogastisburg.  It was recreated in the Carolingian Empire and its dukes appointed by the king until it was absorbed by the Saxon dukes in 908.  From about 1111/12 the territory was ruled by the Landgraves of Thuringia as Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Khosrow IV was a Sasanian usurper who ruled briefly in 631.  Little is known about his rule, he appears to have ruled during a time of upheaval and chaos across the Sasanian Empire the 7th century has the century where Iran has plunged into its dark ages.  He was the son of Mah-Adhur Gushnasp, who was the minister of the Sasanian Empire during the reign of Ardashir III, and Kahar-dukht, the daughter of Yazdandar, who was the son of Khosrau I.  His rule seems to coincide with other pretenders such as Hormizd VI so it is likely that he ruled a district or province rather than the Empire in its entirety.  He was killed after a few days of reign. Samo founded the first recorded political union of Slavic tribes, known as Samo's Empire (realm, kingdom, or tribal union), stretching from Silesia to present-day Slovenia, ruling from 623 until his death in 658.  According to Fredegarius, the only contemporary source, Samo was a Frankish merchant who unified several Slavic tribes against robber raids and violence by nearby settled Avars, showing such bravery and command skills in battle that he was elected as the Slavic king (Latin: Rex Sclavorum ).  In 631, Samo successfully defended his realm against the Frankish Kingdom in the three-day Battle of Wogastisburg. Chach (c. 631-711 CE) (Sindhi: چچ‎ ) was a Brahmin who reigned as king of Sindh in the mid-7th century CE.  A former prime minister to the king Rai Sahasi II, Chach ascended to the throne by marrying the king's widow.  The Brahmin dynasty under Chach expanded the kingdom of Sindh, and his successful efforts to subjugate surrounding monarchies and ethnic groups into an empire covering the entire Indus valley and beyond were recorded in the Chach Nama."}], "output": "  The empire that succeeded the Sasanian Empire after Farrukhzad Khosrau V's brief reign was the Frankish Empire.**"},

John was created by script writers Sheri Anderson, Thom Racina and Leah Laiman as The Pawn in 1985 and introduced by executive producers Betty Corday and Al Rabin.  John becomes one of Days of Our Lives'  most popular characters when he is revealed to be the presumed dead Roman Brady (Wayne Northrop) with plastic surgery and amnesia.  However, Northrop's return in 1991 led to Hogestyn's Roman being retconned into the entirely separate character of John Black, which also establishes the supercouple pairing of John and Marlena, due to John's affair with Roman's wife, Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall).  During the time in which he believes he is Roman, John picks up the mantle of Roman's feud with the notorious international criminal Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo).  John and Stefano's feud is central to the character's history as Stefano is partly responsible for John's memory loss.  Their lives are further intertwined in 2008 when the two are falsely led to believe they are half brothers—a story that was later disproved.  Hogestyn's portrayal has made him one of daytime's most popular and recognizable stars.  Hogestyn was attributed with helping the series out of its ratings slump in the 1980s.  He was often featured in soap opera magazines such as Soap Opera Digest and Soap Opera Weekly."}], "output": "  Erinsborough.**"},

The war started when Peter Aylen, a major Irish timber operator, organized a group of Irishmen to attack other timber operations.  This group was known as the Shiners.  They attacked French Canadian timber rafts and fought against the French Canadian on the streets of Bytown. French Canadians (also referred to as Franco-Canadians or Canadiens; French: Canadien(ne)s français(es) ) are an ethnic group who trace their ancestry to French colonists who settled in Canada from the 17th century onward.  Today, French Canadians constitute the main French-speaking population in Canada, accounting for about 22% of the total population.The Oku people, also commonly known as Oku Mohammedans or Aku Mohammedansin Sierra Leone and as the Aku Marabou or Oku Marabou in the Gambia, are an ethnic group in Sierra Leone and the Gambia.  The Oku people are the descendants of liberated Africans of Yoruba descent from Southwest Nigeria who were liberated or came to Sierra Leone as settlers in the mid 19th century and formed a distinctive ethnic group The Oku are virtually all Muslims and are known for their conservative muslim population.  The British colonial government provided official recognition to the Oku Mohammedan community as a distinctive community in Sierra Leone.  Although the Sierra Leone government officially considered the Oku people as members of the Creole ethnic group, many Sierra Leoneans consider the Oku people as a distinctive ethnic group. The Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) is an Irish Catholic fraternal organisation.  Members must be Catholic and either born in Ireland or of Irish descent.  Its largest membership is now in the United States, where it was founded in New York City in 1836.  Its name was adopted by groups of Irish immigrants in the United States, its purpose to act as guards to protect Catholic churches from anti-Catholic forces in the mid-19th century, and to assist Irish Catholic immigrants, especially those who faced discrimination or harsh coal mining working conditions.  Many members in the coal mining area of Pennsylvania had a background with the Molly Maguires.  It became an important focus of Irish American political activity. The Pinpu tribe peoples, also called the Pepo or Plains tribes, are peoples that mainly settled in the western plains of Taiwan.  They led a primitive agricultural life before the mass arrival of Han immigrants.  Since the 17th century, they have faced the strong forces from outside, such as the Dutch, the Spanish, and the Han Chinese, and they have failed to resist their fate to be assimilated.  By the end of 19th century, most Pingpu tribes had been almost completely Hanised (hanhua), and they have lost their languages and cultures.  They have become an invisible ethnic group in a society highly dominated by the Han Chinese.  During the period of Japanese rule, Japanese scholars conducted investigations and research on the Plains tribes based on anthropology and ethnology.  The present categorization of the Plains tribes has resulted from their thorough study as the following: African Bermudians or Bermudians of African descent are Bermudians whose ancestry lies within the continent of Africa.  The population descented from Black Africans, exported to Bermuda as slaves.  Some Black Bermudians were Free Blacks who chose to immigrate to the island to work as indentured servants during the 17th century.  By the 19th century the Black population surpassed the White population and became Bermuda's largest ethnic group, which was initially classed as being Coloured alongside all other non-white ethnicities of Bermuda.  Black Bermudian became a recognised ethnic group in Bermuda in the 20th century, by which time it was the largest ethnic group on the island."}], "output": "  The answer to your question is: French Canadians."},

Both films starred Robert Redford.Australian Property Law is the system of laws regulating and prioritising the rights, interests and responsibilities of individuals in relation to things.  These things are a form of property or right to possession or ownership of an object.  The law orders or prioritises rights and classifies property as either real and tangible, such as land, or intangible, such as the right of an author to their literary works or personal but tangible, such as a book or a pencil.  The scope of what constitutes a thing capable of being classified as property and when an individual or body corporate gains priority of interest over a thing has in legal scholarship been heavily debated on a philosophical level.

The name honours Italian naturalist Luigi Ferdinando Marsili (1656–1730). Brabejum is a genus of a single species of large evergreen tree, Brabejum stellatifolium in the Proteaceae, commonly called wild almond, bitter almond or ghoeboontjie.  It is restricted in the wild to South Africa's Western Cape Province, where it grows in thickets along the banks of streams.  The plant is of botanical interest as being Africa's only member of the large grevilleoid subfamily.  It is a bushy small tree with branches widely at ground level and numerous erect vigorous stems.  Leaves to 6 in (15 cm) long, narrow and bluntly toothed, appear at intervals along the branches, mostly in whorls of 6.  In summer, the plant bears white flowers densely crowded on spikes arising from rusty buds at the leaf axils.  The fruits to 2 in (5 cm) long, magenta to reddish brown, similar to an almond, appear in autumn.  The nut is too bitter to eat; however, in earlier times it was boiled, roasted, and ground to make a coffee drink.Sinocyclocheilus is a genus of freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae endemic to China, where only found in Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan.  Almost all of its species live in or around caves and most of these have adaptions typical of cavefish such as a lack of scales, lack of pigmentation and reduced eyes (some are completely blind).  Several species have an unusual hunchbacked appearance and some of the cave-dwellers have a horn on the back (above the forehead), the function of which is unclear.  In contrast, the Sinocyclocheilus species that live aboveground, as well as a few found underground, show no clear cavefish adaptions.  They are relatively small fish reaching up to 23 cm in length.  The individual species have small ranges and populations, leading to the status of most of the evaluated species as threatened.  Many species populations in the genus have yet to be evaluated. Myiodynastes is a genus of birds in the family Tyrannidae.  Created by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1857, the genus contains five species which are collectively referred to as sulphur-bellied flycatchers; that name is also given to one of the individual species in the genus.  The genus name Myiodynastes is a compound word composed from two Greek words: muia, meaning fly and dunastẽs, meaning ruler. Leptospermum is a genus of shrubs and small trees in the myrtle family Myrtaceae commonly known as tea trees, although this name is sometimes also used for some species of Melaleuca.  Most species are endemic to Australia, with the greatest diversity in the south of the continent but some are native to other parts of the world, including New Zealand and Southeast Asia.  Leptospermums all have five conspicuous petals and five groups of stamens which alternate with the petals.  There is a single style in the centre of the flower and the fruit is a woody capsule.  The first formal description of a leptospermum was published in 1776 by the German botanists Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Johann Georg Adam Forster, but an unambiguous definition of individual species in the genus was not achieved until 1979.  Leptospermums grow in a wide range of habitats but are most commonly found in moist, low-nutrient soils.  They have important uses in horticulture, in the production of honey and in floristry. Araripesuchus is an extinct genus of notosuchian crocodyliform that lived in Gondwana during the Cretaceous Period.  The genus includes at least five species found throughout Western Africa and South America.  The relationship of the individual species within this genus is hotly debated, specifically, the placement of Araripesuchus wegeneri.  A. wegeneri is a small bodied crocodyliform characterized by relatively elongate limbs, an upright gait, and marked heterodonty.  The tooth morphology, when combined with tooth wear and orientation, suggests that this animal may have been an omnivore or herbivore.  Additionally, the gracile limbs and their orientation imply that this was a terrestrial animal.  These features demonstrate that Araripesuchus wegeneri stands in stark contrast to its modern-day relatives, crocodiles and alligators."}], "output": "  According to the passage, the genus of more individual species of plants is Marsilea, with approximately 65 species."},

Boren or United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.? \n\n Passage: United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 US 131 (1948) (also known as the Hollywood Antitrust Case of 1948, the Paramount Case, the Paramount Decision or the Paramount Decree) was a landmark United States Supreme Court antitrust case that decided the fate of movie studios owning their own theatres and holding exclusivity rights on which theatres would show their films.  It would also change the way Hollywood movies were produced, distributed, and exhibited.  The Court held in this case that the existing distribution scheme was in violation of the antitrust laws of the United States, which prohibit certain exclusive dealing arrangements. Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190 (1976) , was the first case in which a majority of the United States Supreme Court determined that statutory or administrative sex classifications were subject to intermediate scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.Block booking is a system of selling multiple films to a theater as a unit.  Block booking was the prevailing practice among Hollywood's major studios from the turn of the 1930s until it was outlawed by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. (1948).  Under block booking, independent ('unaffiliated') theater owners were forced to take large numbers of [a] studio's pictures sight unseen.  Those studios could then parcel out second-rate product along with A-class features and star vehicles, which made both production and distribution operations more economical.  The element of the system involving the purchase of unseen pictures is known as blind bidding. Richard John Baker v. Gerald R. Nelson, 291 Minn. 310, 191 N.W.2d 185 (1971) is a case in which the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a state law limiting marriage to persons of the opposite sex did not violate the U.S. Constitution.  Baker appealed, and on October 10, 1972, the United States Supreme Court dismissed the appeal for want of a substantial federal question.  Because the case came to the U.S. Supreme Court through mandatory appellate review (not certiorari), the dismissal constituted a decision on the merits and established Baker v. Nelson as precedent, though the extent of its precedential effect had been subject to debate.  In May 2013, Minnesota legalized same-sex marriage and it took effect on August 1, 2013.  Subsequently, on June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court explicitly overruled Baker in Obergefell v. Hodges making same-sex marriage legal nationwide.

In Britain, cranberry may refer to the native species Vaccinium oxycoccos, while in North America, cranberry may refer to Vaccinium macrocarpon.  Vaccinium oxycoccos is cultivated in central and northern Europe, while Vaccinium macrocarpon is cultivated throughout the northern United States, Canada and Chile.  In some methods of classification, Oxycoccus is regarded as a genus in its own right.  They can be found in acidic bogs throughout the cooler regions of the northern hemisphere. Captain Henry Hall was an American from Dennis, Massachusetts who fought in the American Revolutionary War, who later was the first to successfully cultivate cranberries.Vice-Admiral Robert Plampin (1762 – 14 February 1834), was a British Royal Navy officer during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, serving in the American Revolutionary War, the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, but best known for his time as commander of the British colony of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic during the period when former Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was imprisoned there.  Born into a Navy family, Plampin went to sea at age 13 and fought throughout the American Revolutionary War, based principally in the Caribbean Sea.  During the French Revolutionary Wars, Plampin served in a number of ships with mixed success, once being involved in a shipwreck and twice serving ashore during sieges.  After the Peace of Amiens, Plampin took command of the ship of the line HMS Powerful and operated successfully in the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.  In 1816, following the defeat and capture of the French Emperor, Plampin was placed in command of the squadron at the Cape of Good Hope, which also had responsibility for Saint Helena, which Plampin regularly visited and had numerous conversations with Napoleon.

O'Hara began her career as a Broadway actress in 1983 when she portrayed Ellie May Chipley in the musical Showboat.  In 1991, she made her motion picture debut in Disney's Beauty and the Beast, in which she voiced the film's heroine, Belle.  Following the critical and commercial success of Beauty and the Beast, O'Hara reprised her role as Belle in the film's two direct-to-video follow-ups,  and Belle's Magical World. Something There is a song written by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken for Walt Disney Pictures 30th animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991).  Sung by the majority of the film's main cast, the song was recorded by American actors Paige O'Hara as Belle and Robby Benson as the Beast via voice over, featuring actors Jerry Orbach, Angela Lansbury and David Ogden Stiers as Lumiere, Mrs. Potts and Cogsworth, respectively.  The only song performed by the Beast, Something There is heard midway through Beauty and the Beast during a scene in which Belle and the Beast finally begin to acknowledge their own feelings for each other.Robin David Segal (born January 21, 1956), better known by the stage name Robby Benson, is an American actor, director, singer and educator.

Recorded by American actor Jerry Orbach and English actress Angela Lansbury as Lumiere and Mrs. Potts, respectively, Be Our Guest is a large-scale Broadway-inspired musical number that takes place during the first half of Beauty and the Beast, performed by the castle's staff of enchanted objects in an elaborate attempt to welcome Belle.  Menken initially intended for the melody of Be Our Guest to be temporary but was ultimately unable to compose a satisfying one with which to replace it.  The song had originally been intended for Belle's father Maurice.  However, Be Our Guest had to be entirely re-written as the story evolved in order to return its focus to Belle. Belle is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Howard Ashman for Walt Disney Pictures' 30th animated feature film Beauty and the Beast (1991).  Originally recorded by American actress and singer Paige O'Hara and American actor Richard White, Belle, a mid-tempo French and classical music-inspired song, incorporates both Broadway and musical theatre elements.  The film's first song and opening number, Belle appears during Beauty and the Beast as a large scale operetta-style production number that introduces the film's heroine Belle, considered a book-loving nonconformist by the townspeople of the village, who has grown weary of the provincial life in which she is supposed to live, and Gaston, the film's narcissistic villain who wishes to desire her hand in marriage despite Belle's rejections."}], "output": "  According to the passage, the American actress/singer born in 1956 who recorded the song \"Something There\" for Beauty and the Beast is Paige O'Hara.**"},

He plays the Sarod.  His Dhrupadee Veenkar style of Ustad Alauddin Khan's Seni Veenkar Gharana: analytically imaginative prosodic progression with metrical waves of melodic phrases interwoven with highest order of technical brilliance and maturity reminds the great legends of the Gharana.  He is an internationally recognized instructor of classical Indian music. The sarod (or sarode) (सरोद) is a stringed instrument of India, used mainly in Indian classical music.  Along with the sitar, it is among the most popular and prominent instruments in Hindustani classical music.  The sarod is known for a deep, weighty, introspective sound, in contrast with the sweet, overtone-rich texture of the sitar, with sympathetic strings that give it a resonant, reverberant quality.  It is a fretless instrument able to produce the continuous slides between notes known as meend (glissandi), which are important in Indian music.Chander Bari is a 2007 Bengali film directed by Tarun Majumdar.  The film centers on a middle class joint family.  The film is based on a Bengali story written by Pracheta Gupta.  Majumdar used some Rabindra Sangeets in this film. The sousaphone ( ), is a brass instrument in the same family as the more widely known tuba.  Created around 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa (whom the instrument was then named after), it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching, as well as to carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band.  Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or buzz into a large cupped mouthpiece.  Unlike the tuba, the instrument is bent in a circle to fit around the body of the musician; it ends in a large, flaring bell that is pointed forward, projecting the sound ahead of the player.  Because of the ease of carrying and the direction of sound, it is widely employed in marching bands, as well as various other musical genres.  Sousaphones were originally made out of brass but in the mid-20th century started to be made from lighter materials like fiberglass; today both types are in wide use. A bukkehorn (Norwegian) or bockhorn (Swedish), also called ″Billy Goat Horn″ in English, is an ancient Scandinavian musical instrument, made from the horn of a ram or a goat.  The horn is usually made from a goat horn harvested 5 to 7 years before the instrument is crafted.  It was traditionally used by shepherds and milkmaids on summer dairy farms in the mountains, as a signal-instrument or as a scaring instrument.  When the horn later got finger holes it became possible to play melodies with it.  The instrument has two blowing-techniques: the trumpet-principle is the most common, but the clarinet-principle is also used. An experimental musical instrument (or custom-made instrument) is a musical instrument that modifies or extends an existing instrument or class of instruments, or defines or creates a new class of instrument.  Some are created through simple modifications, such as cracked drum cymbals or metal objects inserted between piano strings in a prepared piano.  Some experimental instruments are created from household items like a homemade mute for brass instruments such as bathtub plugs.  Other experimental instruments are created from electronic spare parts, or by mixing acoustic instruments with electric components."}], "output": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help!\n\nApatim Majumdar plays the Sarod.**"},

The event is part of the athletics programme at the Olympic Games and the World Championships in Athletics and is common at championship level events.

Chrysalis: A Magazine of Women's Culture was a feminist publication produced from 1977 to 1980.  The self-published magazine was founded by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie at the Woman's Building in downtown Los Angeles.  Chysalis grew from Grimstad and Rennie's editorial work on the self-help resource books, The New Woman's Survival Catalog and The New Woman's Survival Sourcebook.  Chrysalis distinguished itself from other feminist publications through an organic integration of politics, literature, cultural studies, and art.  The magazine was produced through a collective process that grew out of the feminist practice of consciousness-raising.  Unusually broad in scope, Chrysalis did not substitute breadth for quality.  The authors, poets, essayists, and researchers contributing to the magazine reveals a veritable who's who of towering intellects of the feminist movement: black lesbian activist Audre Lorde; the magazine's poetry editor, Robin Morgan, who later served as editor of Ms. from 1990-1993: award winning poet Adrienne Rich; novelist Marge Percy; artist Judy Chicago; science fiction writer Joanna Russ; art critic Lucy Lippard, plus Mary Daly, Dolores Hayden, Andrea Dworkin, Marilyn Hacker, Arlene Raven, and Elizabeth Janeway.

This influence decreased at the end of the 1990s, but it continued on the women's magazines and fashion magazines.  However, business magazines have not been subject to the dominance of Germany.  The major fields of Austrian magazines are news, popular science and special interest topics.  On the other hand, since the Austrian press market is divided between magazines and newspapers, magazines have a significant function in the press market.

THANS organises an annual purple ribbon awareness campaign in memory of the École Polytechnique massacre.  THANS was founded in 1989.  THANS conducted interviews with 34 physically abused women who subsequently sought resolution through family law mediation.  In 2000, THANS released a report based on these interviews, stating that most of the women would not recommend legal mediation to other abused women.  In 2008, THANS supported Bill 81, which they hoped would become the Domestic Violence Elimination Act, but Minister of Justice Cecil Clarke chose not to call the bill for a third reading.  In 2009, Darrell Dexter of the New Democratic Party identified THANS in his promise to increase government funding of halfway houses in Nova Scotia.  In 2012, THANS partnered with the World YWCA, Family SOS, Silent Witness Nova Scotia, and Leave Out Violence to host the Atlantic Ballet Theatre of Canada's Ghosts of Violence, a ballet about domestic violence, in Halifax.

Thomas Loren Friedman (born July 20, 1953) is an American journalist and author.  He is a three time Pulitzer Prize winner.Introduction to Metaphysics (French: Introduction à la Métaphysique) is a 1903 essay about the concept of reality by Henri Bergson.  For Bergson, reality occurs not in a series of discrete states but as a process similar to that described by process philosophy or the Greek philosopher Heraclitus.  Reality is fluid and cannot be completely understood through reductionistic analysis, which he said implies that we go around an object, gaining knowledge from various perspectives which are relative.  Instead, reality can be grasped absolutely only through intuition, which Bergson expressed as entering into the object. Duration (French: la durée) is a theory of time and consciousness posited by the French philosopher Henri Bergson.  Bergson sought to improve upon inadequacies he perceived in the philosophy of Herbert Spencer, due, he believed, to Spencer's lack of comprehension of mechanics, which led Bergson to the conclusion that time eluded mathematics and science.  Bergson became aware that the moment one attempted to measure a moment, it would be gone: one measures an immobile, complete line, whereas time is mobile and incomplete.  For the individual, time may speed up or slow down, whereas, for science, it would remain the same.  Hence Bergson decided to explore the inner life of man, which is a kind of duration, neither a unity nor a quantitative multiplicity.  Duration is ineffable and can only be shown indirectly through images that can never reveal a complete picture.  It can only be grasped through a simple intuition of the imagination. Samuel Eliot Morison, (July 9, 1887 – May 15, 1976) was an American historian noted for his works of maritime history and American history that were both authoritative and popular.  He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1912, and taught history at the university for 40 years.  He won Pulitzer Prizes for Admiral of the Ocean Sea (1942), a biography of Christopher Columbus, and John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography (1959).  In 1942, he was commissioned to write a history of United States naval operations in World War II, which was published in 15 volumes between 1947 and 1962.  Morison wrote the popular Oxford History of the American People (1965), and co-authored the classic textbook The Growth of the American Republic (1930) with Henry Steele Commager.  Over the course of his distinguished career, Morison received eleven honorary doctoral degrees, and garnered numerous literary prizes, military honors, and national awards from both foreign countries and the United States, including two Pulitzer Prizes, two Bancroft Prizes, the Balzan Prize, the Legion of Merit, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The 2011 Pulitzer Prizes were announced on Monday, April 18, 2011.  The Los Angeles Times won two prizes, including the highest honor for Public Service.  The New York Times also won two awards.  No prize was handed out in the Breaking News category.  The Wall Street Journal won an award for the first time since 2007.

It opened in Nashville, Tennessee in 2000 on the former site of the Opryland USA theme park. Music City Queen was a replica showboat formerly operating for entertainment purposes on the Cumberland River in the southern United States.  It was the smaller of two stern-wheel paddle steamers based at Opry Mills in Nashville, Tennessee; the other is the General Jackson.The Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country-music stage concert in Nashville, Tennessee, which was founded on November 28, 1925, by George D. Hay as a one-hour radio barn dance on WSM.  Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest-running radio broadcast in US history, albeit not the longest-running one on a radio network.  Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits.  It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners. Keith Bilbrey (born August 14, 1952) is an American country music disc jockey and television host in Nashville, Tennessee.  He served as a disc jockey at Nashville's WSM, as an announcer on the Grand Ole Opry, and as the host of TNN’s Grand Ole Opry Live. The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is a railroad line owned by CSX Transportation in the U.S. State of Tennessee.  The Subdivision is broken up into 5 sections all in Nashville, Tennessee.  The northern part of the Terminal is in Madison, Tennessee at milepost 000/0BA 174 on the southern end of the Ex-L&N Mainline Subdivision at Monfort.  Disptach for the Mainline Sub is known as LD which is part of the Cincinnati Division.  From here in Madison begins the double track that stays for another 22 miles south to Brentwood, Tennessee.  At milepost 000/0BA/00H 176.6, the famous Johnny Cash Amqui location where the Ex-L&N Evansville, Indiana line, the Henderson Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  Dispatch for the Henderson Sub is known as SA and operates on AAR58.  There are two crossings near each other, Williams Ave and Nesbitt Lane at Amqui.  From here the Terminal goes south about 2 miles to the Nashville National Cemetery to the first major location, known as Ekin, 000179, where there is a cross over track from number 1 to number 2 track (left to right track).  There is also the first EDD (Defect Detector) at 000179.1.  Few more miles southward, the next major location appears.  At 000181.0, Maplewood is a major location for the Terminal.  From here the regular Terminal goes south to swap crews at Kayne Ave, and the right side, Radnor Cutoff, detours the city and gives yard departures and arrivals direct access to and from Radnor yard to cities like Louisville and Chicago.  The Cutoff runs from Maplewood to Shelby Park double track.  From Shebly the track converges into one to pass the historic Shelby bridge, then it opens back to double track.  From there, the cutoff hits the Intermediates at 0BA187.0 known as Chicken Pike.  The Radnor Cutoff carries the L&N mainline classification of 0BA but meets the main at the same milepost from the Terminal.  At Chicken Pike, trains are staged to await arrival to Radnor yard.  Once they get clearance, speed is decreased to 15, and at 0BA188.1 the EDD (Defect Detector) sounds for departures and arrivals.  This location is known as North Radnor.  The right track diverging from the #2 is known as A-1, it is for departure trains to Chattanooga and Atlanta.  The left track which goes west from the #1 is known as A-2, and serves as a departure track to Memphis, and if the cutoff is out of service, all northbound departures.  The interesting piece of Maplewood is the crossovers that are there to move trains from the Cutoff to the Main.  Both lines remain double track for a while.  The main runs south for 2 more miles until the Intermediate signals at 000183.0.  Commonly trains will stop before Delmas Ave when Kayne Ave is at capacity and await dispatch permission before moving south.  From here, the main continues south until the CR Cumberland River Swingbridge, where the main converges into a single track shortly to cross the bridge.  At this point, trains had been running at track speed of around 40.  From the drawbridge into town, speed is reduced to around 10.  After the bridge is passed, the main returns to double track in downtown.  On the #1 track about a half a mile south, another connecting track is present.  This is the Wye track that connects the main with the Bruceton side, while rarely used for mainline trains, locals and river jobs use it.  The location is known as 8th Avenue or 8th Avenue Wye.  The main then runs down to Kayne Ave, the central hotbed of all Nashville thru traffic.  The Memphis, Tennessee Ex-L&N Bruceton Subdivision meets with the Terminal.  The Bruceton Sub begins at Church Street at 00N0.0.  The line then runs single track until 00N0.7 11th Avenue where it turns into double track and also meets the aforementioned, Wye track.  The Bruceton line then goes southwest a while to the next signals, at Shops.  Now speed has been increased.  The line is still double track until Sellars, where speed is increased to 40 and jurisdiction transferred to the SD Dispatcher.  For a short time, 4 main tracks are present and an additional fifth track for switchers and yard movements.  The tracks from left to right in Kayne Ave are as follows: 100, 99, 98, 12, 3.  The Kayne Ave yard is also here in this area, which houses some frieght and some switcher engines.  The tracks to the old shed are covered and removed.  The Union Station is not an active station, but a historic hotel.  Crew change usually occurs at the walkway which is under the Demombreun St bridge by the Kayne Ave Tower.  This is also where the Ex-NC&StL Chattanooga Subdivision begins.  Then tracks run south to Fogg St/South End where things get complicated.  At milepost 000/0BA/00J187 the 98 track merges into the 12 track, making for 3 tracks now.  There is a crossover from 99 to 12, also a crossover from 12 to 3.  About 2/10ths of a mile down the 99 merges into the 12 track reducing the tracks back to the regular double.  About 4/10ths of a mile down the line from Fogg St, 000187.4, Oak St, is a crossover track from #2 to #1 (the track names are no longer 3 and 12, but are back to regular names).  When trains use this crossover northbound, such as Memphis bound trains from the A-2 line, they refer to it as Long Lead.  And now, the Terminal splits into two parts.  The right side turns into a single track shortly, and will become the Chattanooga Subdivision, and the left side runs south to Brentwood.  The right track runs single shortly until double track for a while.  This begins part of the Chattanooga Sub or J-Line.  The #2 meets with the A-2 connection track at 00J2.2 known as A-2.  Speed is now increased to 40.  Commonly northbounds will stage at 4th Ave on the #1 to await clearance.  Now about a mile down the #1 meets the A-1 connection line.  At 00J3.6 known as A-1.  Further down the double track ends at Glencliff (00J4.9).  Now it runs single for three miles until it hits Danley, which has the D Line connection track, which is an arrival track for incoming Radnor trains from the J Line.  At Danley, the Terminal ends but the same dispatcher handles traffic, SC.  At Oak Street, our main terminal line goes south two miles to 000189.0 known as Criaghead or Vine Hill.  There is a crossover here from #1 to #2 track.  And there is also a connection/delivery track to the Nashville and Eastern Railroad which connects the Tennessee Central Railroad Museum to a major railroad.  Trains sometimes stop on the #2 before Craighead if they are waiting to enter Radnor yard.  Sometimes trains wait on the #1 at the Berry Road crossing if they await arrival to Kayne Ave. At this point, speed has been increased to 30 from 10.  Moving south, the line hits Radnor Yard at 000192.  The #2 track meets the E-Line arrival track which most Memphis trains and locals use.  The B-Line which meets the #1 track is used for departures out of the C yard and local jobs.  At Mayton, 000192.3, the B line meets the #1 track, and there is a crossover track from #2 to #1.  Speed is now at 40.  2 miles south, at 000194.0, South Radnor, the next intersection is present.  This is where the Radnor A yard meets the main.  There is a single departure/arrival track that meets the #2 track along with a crossover from #1 to #2 track.  Commonly, the #2 track south of the signals is used to halt trains.  This location is known as TVA, because of the power station that is adjacent.  From here the Terminal runs about 2.5 miles south until we hit the southern tip.  The tracks converge onto one single main, at 000/0BA196.6 known as Brentwood.  Speed is increased to 50 and jurisdiction to the S.E. dispatcher.  The right track is the main, S&NA North, while the left track is the Nashville Subdivision which runs to Columbia and exchanges freight with the TSRR.  The Nashville Terminal Subdivision is one of the busiest locations on the CSX network, and one of the most important. Ryman Auditorium (formerly Grand Ole Opry House and Union Gospel Tabernacle) is a 2,362-seat live performance venue, located at 116 5th Avenue North, in Nashville, Tennessee and is best known as the home of the Grand Ole Opry from 1943 to 1974.

These stores offer a no-frills experience and warehouse shelving stocked well with merchandise intended to move at higher volumes.  Unlike warehouse clubs, warehouse stores do not require a membership or membership fees. Warehouse stores also offer a selection of merchandise sold in bulk, Typically warehouse stores are laid out in a logical format which leads people a certain way around the store to the checkout.  As one enters the store they are directed down an aisle of discounted special buys when entering the store.  From there the layout typically then leads to the fresh Produce followed by the Deli at the back of the store.  Also included bakery and other departments similar to other supermarkets.  Another typical feature of these stores is that the customer bags their own groceries which also helps to reduce the overall cost.  Many warehouse stores are operated by traditional grocery chains both as a way to attract lower income, value conscious consumers and to maximize their buying power in order to lower costs at their mainstream stores.  Notable examples of corporations who operate warehouse stores include United States chains Kroger and Albertsons LLC and the smaller Sacramento-based Nugget Market.  However, WinCo Foods is an exception as it is a warehouse chain of its own and not part of a larger chain of traditional supermarkets like A&P, Safeway, Kroger, or Supervalu.

He received his B.A. from Berea College, and his M.A. and Ph.D. in philosophy from Purdue University.  He is founder and general editor of the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.  He is author, coauthor or editor of more than ten text books. Berea College is a liberal arts work college in the city of Berea, in the U.S. state of Kentucky.  It is located in Madison County, approximately 35 miles south of Lexington.  Founded in 1855, Berea College is distinctive among post-secondary institutions for providing free education to students and for having been the first college in the Southern United States to be coeducational and racially integrated.  Berea College charges no tuition; every admitted student is provided the equivalent of a four-year, full-tuition scholarship (currently worth $97,200; $24,300 per year).Altruism (also called the ethic of altruism, moralistic altruism, and ethical altruism) is an ethical doctrine that holds that the moral value of an individual's actions depend solely on the impact on other individuals, regardless of the consequences on the individual itself.  James Fieser states the altruist dictum as: An action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone except the agent.  Auguste Comte's version of altruism calls for living for the sake of others.  One who holds to either of these ethics is known as an altruist. Alice Lloyd College is a four-year boarding school-style liberal arts work college in Pippa Passes, Kentucky, United States.  It was co-founded by the journalist Alice Spencer Geddes Lloyd, a native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, and June Buchanan, a native of New York City, in 1923, at first under the name of Caney Junior College, as an institution to educate leaders for Appalachia locally.  It became a four-year, bachelor's degree-granting institution in the early 1980s.  Alice Lloyd College is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). Work colleges are distinctive liberal arts colleges in the United States that promote the purposeful integration of work, learning, and service.  At a work college all students work regardless of their academic program or their financial need.  A work college is a public or private non-profit, four-year degree-granting institution of higher learning where student work is an integrated, essential and federally required core component of the educational work-learning-service program.  Unlike Federal Work Study, which is solely need-based, work colleges do not differentiate between those that can afford to pay for their education from those that must work to cover their educational costs.  At work colleges, students are regularly evaluated and assessed on their work performance and can be dismissed from the institution for non-performance in the work program.  Students do not have the ability to buy their way out of the work requirement.  Students perform essential institutional functions in every area imaginable on their campuses and gain a strong sense of ownership and responsibility for their campus community.  Student labor enables work colleges to be far more operationally efficient and administratively lean (compared to more traditional colleges).  This, in turn, contributes to lower operational costs which results in lower – and more affordable – tuition. Liberal arts colleges are primarily colleges or universities with an emphasis upon undergraduate study in the liberal arts.  The Encyclopædia Britannica Concise offers the following definition of the liberal arts as a, college or university curriculum aimed at imparting general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum.  Although the genesis for what is known today as the liberal arts college began in Europe, the term is commonly associated with the United States.  Liberal arts colleges are found in countries all over the world as well.  See the list (link) of international members of the Association of American Colleges and Universities for other institutions offering liberal arts education programs."}], "output": "  Sure!

Under a declaration made in Privy Council in 1960, the name Mountbatten-Windsor applies to male-line descendants of the Queen without royal styles and titles.  Individuals with royal styles do not usually use a surname, but some descendants of the Queen with royal styles have used Mountbatten-Windsor when a surname was required. The Mountbatten family is a European dynasty originating as a branch of the German princely Battenberg family.  The name was adopted during World War I by family members residing in the United Kingdom due to rising anti-German sentiment amongst the British public.  The name is an Anglicisation of the German Battenberg, a small town in Hesse.  The title of count of Battenberg, later prince of Battenberg, was granted to a morganatic branch of the House of Hesse-Darmstadt, itself a cadet branch of the House of Hesse, in the mid 19th century.The Zulu royal family consists of the reigning monarch of the Zulus of South Africa, King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, his consorts, legitimate descendants, near relatives and male-line descendants of his great-grandfather, King Mpande who, as a half-brother of the Zulu Pater Patriae, King Shaka, reigned from 1840 to 1872.  Shaka's policies and conquests transformed a small clan into one of South Africa's most influential pre-colonial realms, extending over much of what is now KwaZulu-Natal. In history and heraldry, a cadet branch consists of the male-line descendants of a monarch or patriarch's younger sons (cadets).  In the ruling dynasties and noble families of much of Europe and Asia, the family's major assets—realm, titles, fiefs, property and income—have historically been passed from a father to his firstborn son in what is known as primogeniture; younger sons—cadets—inherited less wealth and authority to pass to future generations of descendants. The Capetian dynasty , also known as the House of France, is a dynasty of Frankish origin, founded by Hugh Capet.  It is among the largest and oldest royal houses in Europe and the world, and consisting of Hugh Capet's male-line descendants.  The senior line ruled in France as the House of Capet from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of Charles IV in 1328.  They were succeeded by cadet branches, the Houses of Valois and Bourbon, which ruled until the French Revolution.

He is most famous for his darkly satirical, best-selling novel Slaughterhouse-Five (1969). Armageddon in Retrospect is a collection of short stories and essays about war and peace written by Kurt Vonnegut.  It is the first posthumous collection of his previously unpublished writings.  The book includes an introduction by Mark Vonnegut, a letter from Kurt to his family about his experiences as an American prisoner of war in Nazi Germany, and the fire-bombing of Dresden.  Like many of Vonnegut's other books, Armageddon in Retrospect is laden with handwritten quotations and rough drawings by the author.José María Gironella Pous (31 December 1917 in Darnius – 3 January 2003 in Arenys de Mar) was a Spanish author best known for his fictional work The Cypresses Believe in God (Los cipreses creen en Dios), which was published in Spain in 1953 and translated into English by Harriet de Onís in 1955.  The book is a novel in two parts, and is the first novel of four, written from a Roman Catholic viewpoint, by its Catholic author, who had been educated in a seminary — but whose approach is notable for its even-handedness and fair assessment of the many nuances and subtleties among all factions on the eve of war.  The story is set in Girona, a city in eastern Catalonia, and follows the life of a family, from 1931 until the Spanish Civil War breaks out in 1936.  The protagonist is the son of an atheist from Madrid, who is married to a devout Basque woman, and has a younger brother and sister also caught up in the conflict.  In a sequel to Cypresses, One Million Dead (Un millón de muertos), translated by Joan MacLean, Gironella follows the Alvear family through the war.  The next novel is Peace after War, published in English in 1969, and was also translated by MacLean.  The fourth novel, Los hombres lloran solos (Men cry alone), has not been translated and published in English. Little Big Man is a 1964 novel by American author Thomas Berger.  Often described as a satire or parody of the western genre, the book is a modern example of picaresque fiction.

Easily Berger's best known work, Little Big Man was made into a popular film by Arthur Penn.  It has been called Berger's response to the great American myth of the frontier, representing as it does most of the central traditions of American literature.

It comprises the ancient Kingdoms of Mide, Osraige and Leinster.  Following the 12th-century Norman invasion of Ireland, the historic fifths of Leinster and Mide gradually merged, mainly due to the impact of the Pale, which straddled both, thereby forming the present-day province of Leinster.  The ancient kingdoms were shired into a number of counties for administrative and judicial purposes.  In later centuries, local government legislation has seen further sub-division of the historic counties. Patrick Kennedy (early 1801 – 29 March 1873) was a folklorist from Co.  Wexford, Ireland.  A bookseller by trade, he is known for his collections of Irish (Leinster) folktales.  The tales are told in rusticated English of the Irish peasantry who had established roots in The Pale, the anglicized part of Ireland.  He is widely credited with preserving irish idioms in the turn of phrase, sentence structure, Irish words.Seumas MacManus (31 December 1867 – 23 October 1960) was an Irish author, dramatist, and poet known for his ability to reinterpret Irish folktales for modern audiences. The Greek Princess and the Young Gardener is an Irish fairy tale collected by Patrick Kennedy in Fireside Stories of Ireland.  Joseph Jacobs included it in More Celtic Fairy Tales. Irish Fairy Tales is a retelling of ten Irish folktales by the Irish author James Stephens.  The English illustrator Arthur Rackham provided interior artwork, including numerous black and white illustrations and sixteen color plates.  The stories are set in a wooded, Medieval Ireland filled with larger-than-life hunters, warriors, kings, and fairies.  Many stories concern the Fianna and their captain, Fionn mac Uail, from the Fenian Cycle of Irish mythology. Jack and his Comrades is a short Irish fairy tale describing the title character's story of success with the help of his animal helpers, collected by folklorist Patrick Kennedy from a resident of County Wexford, Ireland, and published in Legendary Fictions of the Irish Celts (1866).  It was later reprinted, revised but only slightly, by Joseph Jacobs in his Celtic fairy tale compilation."}], "output": "  Leinster**."},

After sharing Skegoneill Avenue (Brantwood) and Seaview (Crusaders) for some years the club moved in 1980 to a permanent new home at New Grosvenor Stadium, Ballyskeagh, County Antrim, on the southern outskirts of Belfast.  The club was known as Distillery until 1999, when it changed its name to 'Lisburn Distillery' in an attempt to associate itself more closely with its adopted borough (now city) of Lisburn.  The club colour is white.  The club, a founder member of the Irish League in 1890, was relegated in May 2013. Sean Connor (born 12 July 1967) is a former footballer and manager.

The club originates in the Newington area of Belfast, although owing to the lack of facilities for junior and intermediate clubs in north Belfast they have played home matches at Muckamore Park in Antrim, Brantwood FC on Skegoneill Avenue, Richardson Park in Dunmurry and The Cliff in Larne.  In 2008, the club became involved in a partnership with IFA Premiership club Crusaders, with a view to securing funding for a new, shared ground in north Belfast.  As part of the arrangement, Newington used Crusaders’ current ground Seaview for home matches in 2008–09, marking a return to home matches in the club's native north Belfast.  For the 2013–14 season, the club's first season in NIFL Championship 2, Seaview will be the home venue once again.

The son of Montague and his wife, he secretly loves and marries Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet.  Forced into exile after slaying Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel, Romeo commits suicide upon hearing falsely of Juliet's death. Benvolio is a fictional character in Shakespeare's drama Romeo and Juliet.  He is Montague's nephew and Romeo's cousin.  Benvolio serves as an unsuccessful peacemaker in the play, attempting to prevent violence between the Capulet and Montague families.Prince Hamlet is the title character and protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet.  He is the Prince of Denmark, nephew to the usurping Claudius, and son of King Hamlet, the previous King of Denmark.  At the beginning of the play, he struggles with whether, and how, to avenge the murder of his father, and struggles with his own sanity along the way.  By the end of the tragedy, Hamlet has caused the deaths of Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and two acquaintances of his from the University of Wittenberg Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.  He is also indirectly involved in the deaths of his love Ophelia (drowning) and of his mother Gertrude (poisoned by Claudius by mistake). Macbeth ( ; full title The Tragedy of Macbeth) is a tragedy by William Shakespeare; it is thought to have been first performed in 1606.  It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake.  Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare's acting company, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright's relationship with his sovereign.  It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book, and is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. Revenge tragedy (less commonly referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) defines a genre of plays made popular in early modern England.  Ashley H. Thorndike formally established this genre in his seminal 1902 article The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays, which characterizes revenge tragedy as a tragedy whose leading motive is revenge and whose main action deals with the progress of this revenge, leading to the death of the murderers and often the death of the avenger himself.  Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy (c.1580s) is often considered the inaugural revenge tragedy on the early modern stage.  However, more recent research extends early modern revenge tragedy to the 1560s with poet and classicist Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca at Oxford University, including Troas (1559), Thyestes (1560), and Hercules Furens (1561).  Additionally, Thomases Norton and Sackville's play Gorbuduc (1561) is considered an early revenge tragedy (almost twenty years prior to The Spanish Tragedy).  Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's Hamlet (c.1599-1602) and Titus Andronicus (c.1588-1593) and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy (c.1606). Shakespearean tragedy is the designation given to most tragedies written by playwright William Shakespeare.  Many of his history plays share the qualifiers of a Shakespearean tragedy, but because they are based on real figures throughout the History of England, they were classified as histories in the First Folio.  The Roman tragedies—Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra and Coriolanus—are also based on historical figures, but because their source stories were foreign and ancient they are almost always classified as tragedies rather than histories.  Shakespeare's romances (tragicomic plays) were written late in his career and published originally as either tragedy or comedy.  They share some elements of tragedy featuring a high status central character but end happily like Shakespearean comedies.  Several hundred years after Shakespeare's death, scholar F.S. Boas also coined a fifth category, the problem play, for plays that don't fit neatly into a single classification because of their subject matter, setting, or ending.  The classifications of certain Shakespeare plays are still debated among scholars."}], "output": "  Based on the provided passage, the character who slays Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, is Romeo.

The Flowers of Romance were an early punk band, formed in mid-1976 by Jo Faull and Sarah Hall.  The band never played live or released any recordings, and, like London SS and Masters of the Backside, are more famed for the number of band members that later became well known, including: Sid Vicious of the Sex Pistols, Keith Levene (an early member of The Clash and later of Public Image Ltd) and Palmolive and Viv Albertine, who went on to play in The Slits.  Despite never playing live, they were interviewed by a fanzine named SKUM, in which Sid Vicious proclaimed I'll just be the yob that I am now.Glen Matlock (born 27 August 1956) is an English musician best known for being the bass guitarist in the original line-up of the punk rock band the Sex Pistols.  He is sometimes credited as a co-author on 10 of the 12 songs on Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols, although he had left the band by the time the record was released and the bass was played by Steve Jones.  He also continues to make his own records and tour with various bands, including the Sex Pistols. Live at Winterland 1978 is a live album by the Avengers.  It was released through online music stores on February 16, 2010.  The album features a recording of their set on January 14, 1978 at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco, CA, when they opened for the Sex Pistols on what would become the Sex Pistols final show, before reuniting years later.  The Sex Pistols' set has been released on an album of the same name.  Songs from this album were previously released on a couple 7 bootlegs titled Penelope and Summer of Hate. The Idols with Sid Vicious is a concert album of former Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious performing with The Idols; though recorded in September 1978, it wasn't released until 1993.  Steve Dior provided a recording of this performance to the New Rose record label.  It was originally released by the Fan Club division of New Rose.  It was also released in Japan by Teichiku Records, under license from New Rose. Bodies is a Sex Pistols song about the shock of abortion from the 1977 album Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols.  The lyrics contain very graphic imagery about a terminated fetus and feature a great deal of profanity for the time: the third and final verse begins with a couplet in which the word fuck is repeated five times in rapid succession.  Along with the later Belsen Was a Gas, it is probably the most graphic and controversial Sex Pistols song in both its subject matter and style.  Musically, it is also the fastest and heaviest song in the Sex Pistols canon — characterized by thudding drums, droning buzzsaw guitar, and shouted vocals.  As such, it can be considered a significant antecedent to the genres of hardcore, thrash, and speed metal that was to emerge in the 1980s."}], "output": "  Sure!

They are anabolic and increase protein within cells, especially in skeletal muscles, and also have varying degrees of androgenic and virilizing effects, including induction of the development and maintenance of masculine secondary sexual characteristics such as the growth of the vocal cords and body hair.  The word anabolic, referring to anabolism, comes from the Greek ἀναβολή anabole, that which is thrown up, mound.  They are one of three types of sex hormone agonists, the others being estrogens like estradiol and progestogens like progesterone. Anabolic/androgenic steroids are drugs that are obtained from the male hormone, testosterone.  Anabolic steroids are used for muscle-building and strength gain for cosmetic reasons as well as for performance-enhancement in athletics and bodybuilding.  Anabolic steroids work in many ways by increasing protein synthesis in the muscles and by eliminating the catabolic process (the process of breaking down skeletal muscle for energy).  It is common for teens and adults to use steroids as they stimulate and encourage muscle growth much more rapidly than natural body building.Docking is the intentional removal of part of an animal's tail or, sometimes, ears.  The term cropping is more commonly used in reference to the cropping of ears, while docking more commonly—but not exclusively—refers to the tail.  The term tailing is also commonly used.  The term arises because the living flesh of the tail, from which the animal's tail hairs grow, commonly is known as the dock. Tensile testing, also known as tension testing, is a fundamental materials science test in which a sample is subjected to a controlled tension until failure.  The results from the test are commonly used to select a material for an application, for quality control, and to predict how a material will react under normal forces. Properties that are directly measured via a tensile test are ultimate tensile strength, maximum elongation and reduction in area.  From these measurements the following properties can also be determined: Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, and strain-hardening characteristics.  Uniaxial tensile testing is the most commonly used for obtaining the mechanical characteristics of isotropic materials.  For anisotropic materials, such as composite materials and textiles, biaxial tensile testing is required. A STOLport or STOLPORT was an airport designed with STOL (Short Take-Off and Landing) operations in mind, usually for an aircraft class of its weight and size.  The term STOLport did not appear to be in common usage as of 2008 although was commonly used by pilots flying into Biggin Hill during 1986/87 when the London City airport was opened restricting approaches and ceilings to the north of Biggin.  A STOLport normally had a short single runway, in general shorter than 5000 ft .  STOLports only accepted certain types of aircraft, often only smaller propeller aircraft, often with limits on the amount of fuel that can be taken.  In the United States, short runway facilities are simply known as airports and the term STOLport has not been commonly used since the early 1970s. Trickle valves, also known as vacuum valves, are commonly used in industrial dust collection applications to maintain an airlock seal on a dust collector hopper while allowing bulk solid material to be automatically discharged.  These valves are typically a less expensive alternative to more commonly used rotary airlocks.  Unlike rotary airlock valves which are driven by either an electric motor or a gas or air-powered motor, trickle valves require no external power source and are therefore well-suited for use in mechanical trenchers, where a dust-free environment in the pinnacle truss and axle bore is required for smooth operation.  Trickle values were originally developed for this purpose."}], "output": "  Based on the provided passage, the term \"AAS\" is commonly used in bodybuilding to refer to \"anabolic-androgenic steroids.\""},

Nicknamed the Hell Hawks, the squadron fought during World War II in the Philippines and at the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  With its assignment to the USS Essex (CV-9) and Air Group 4, VMF-213 along with VMF-124 was one of the first two Marine squadrons to augment carrier air groups during World War II.  The squadron was credited with downing 117 enemy aircraft during the war. USS Essex (CV/CVA/CVS-9) was an aircraft carrier and the lead ship of the 24-ship Essex class built for the United States Navy during World War II.  She was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name.  Commissioned in December 1942, Essex participated in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning the Presidential Unit Citation and 13 battle stars.  Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine aircraft carrier (CVS).

It belongs to the dogbane family, Apocynaceae.  Pachypodium comes from a Latin form from Greek pachus (thick) and podion (foot) (or Gk podos, root form of pous, foot), hence meaning thick-footed. Stenocereus (Gk.  stenos, narrow, L. cereus, candle) is a genus of columnar or tree-like cacti from the Baja California Peninsula and other parts of Mexico, Arizona in the United States, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela and the ABC islands of the Dutch Caribbean.  The genus has been enlarged by the addition of species from several other genera.  A close relative is the peculiar chinoa or chende cactus, Polaskia chende.Coprosma repens is a species of flowering shrub or small tree of the genus Coprosma, in the family Rubiaceae, native to New Zealand.  Common names include tree bedstraw, taupata, mirror bush, looking-glass bush, New Zealand laurel and shiny leaf. Nitrogen assimilation is the formation of organic nitrogen compounds like amino acids from inorganic nitrogen compounds present in the environment.  Organisms like plants, fungi and certain bacteria that cannot fix nitrogen gas (N) depend on the ability to assimilate nitrate or ammonia for their needs.  Other organisms, like animals, depend entirely on organic nitrogen from their food. Parkia timoriana is a species of flowering plant in the legume family.  English common names include tree bean.  Common names in other languages and regions include petai hutan in Borneo, yongchak in Manipur, India, nitta tree and riang in Thailand, kedawung and peundung in Java, alai in Sumatra, petai kerayong and batai hutan in Malaysia, and kupang and amarang in the Philippines.  It is native to Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Assam in India.  It is widely cultivated for food and wood, and as an ornamental. The poem begins with the description of the tree.  The poet says that the creeper has wound itself round the rugged trunk of the Casuarina Tree, like a huge Python.  The creeper has left deep marks on the trunk of the tree.  The tree is so strong that it bears the tight hold of the creeper.  The tree is described as being gallant, and possibly brave, as very few trees could survive in the strangle-hold of this creeper.  The poet then goes on to describe the life that thrives amidst every facet of the tree.  The tree is metaphorical said as a giant due to its huge size, strength and boldness.  The Casuarina Tree is covered with creeper which bears red crimson flowers which appear as though the tree is wearing a colorful scarf.  Often at night, the garden echoes and it seems to be jubilant and the song (of a nightingale) has no end; it continues till dawn.  At dawn when the poet opens her window she is delighted to see the Casuarina Tree.  Mostly in winters a gray baboon is seen sitting on the crest of the tree seeing the sunrise with her younger ones leaping and playing in the tree's boughs.  The shadow of the tree appears to fall on the huge water tank.  Toru Dutt says that it is not because of the majestic appearance of the Casuarina Tree that it is dear to her heart and soul, but also that she along with her siblings spent happy moments under it.  Toru Dutt has brought out the theme of nature as something that shares feeling with humans, that lightens the burden on the heart.  The poet continues with a description of how strong the image of the tree is, even when in lands far away.  Even in France and Italy (where the poet studied), she can hear the tree's lament.  The poet wishes to consecrate the tree's memory and importance for the sake of those who are now dead - and looks ahead to her own death, hoping that the tree be spared obscurity (or that no-one will remember it).  She immortalizes the tree through this poem like how Wordsworth sanctified the Yew trees of Borrowdale.  She says May love defend thee from Oblivion's curse'- by which she means that she is glad that her love for the Casuarina will protect it from the curse of being forgotten."}], "output": "  Based on the provided passage, both Stenocereus and Pachypodium can include tree-like plants.\n\nStenocereus is a genus of columnar or tree-like cacti, while Pachypodium is a genus of succulent spine-bearing trees and shrubs.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: Both Stenocereus and Pachypodium can include tree-like plants. **"},

Waimea Valley extends behind Waimea Bay.  Waimea means reddish water in Hawaiian. Charles M. Van Artsdalen (January 31, 1941 – July 18, 1979) was a legendary surfer.  He moved to La Jolla, California, from his birthplace of Norfolk, Virginia, at age 14.  Van Artsdalen is best known as a pioneer of surfing 25-foot waves at such North Shore locations as Waimea Bay and Sunset Beach; and tube riding in Hawaii during the early 1960-1970s.  A member of the Duke Kahanamoku Surf Team, he appeared in several surf movies and remained a fixture of the international surfing community until his death from alcohol-related illness in 1979.Brylan Van Artsdalen (born August 14, 1984) is an American mixed martial artist currently competing in the Featherweight division.

Other holders of the title have included sometime actor Gerry Lopez and bodyboarding legend Mike Stewart. Skimboarding (or skimming) is a boardsport in which a skimboard (much like a surfboard but smaller and without fins) is used to glide across the water's surface to meet an incoming breaking wave, and ride it back to shore.  Wave-riding skimboarders perform a variety of surface and air maneuvers, at various stages of their ride, out to, and back with, the wave.  Some of these are known as wraps, big spins, 360 shove-its and 180s.  Unlike surfing, skimboarding begins on the beach by dropping the board onto the thin wash of previous waves.  Skimboarders use their momentum to skim out to breaking waves, which they then catch back into shore in a manner similar to surfing.  Another aspect of skimboarding is flatland, which involves performing tricks derived from skateboarding such as ollies and shove-its on the wash of waves without catching shore breaks. Skimboarding originated in Southern California when Laguna Beach lifeguards wanted to surf the local shore breaks that was too fast and shallow for surfboards.  Skimboarding has developed since then to ride waves much like surfing, performing aerial maneuvers and pulling into the barrel of the wave.  Even further, professionals have started getting towed by waverunners into much larger waves.  Professional Skimboarder, Brad Domke, displayed the new technique in this video."}], "output": "  Butch Van Artsdalen was known for surfing 25-foot waves at Waimea Bay.**"},

It is the oldest college of the university, having been founded in 1284 by Hugo de Balsham, Bishop of Ely, and granted its charter by King Edward I.  Today, Peterhouse has 226 undergraduates, 86 full-time graduate students and 45 fellows.  The modern name of Peterhouse does not include the word college. From a clerical family (Samuel Harland, general secretary of the Commonwealth and Continental Church Society, was his father), Harland was educated at The Dragon School in Oxford and Haileybury.  He then went to university at Peterhouse, Cambridge, taking a law degree.  After two years as a schoolmaster at Sunningdale School he studied for the priesthood at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford and began his ministry as a curate in Melton Mowbray in 1960.The Scott Christian College is a college in Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu.  It was established in 1809.  It is one A College under NAAC ranking and is rated 5-star.

It is the oldest college in the Erstwhile state of Travancore and Madras Presidency.  Wikipedia says: The Maharaja had occasion to visit a school that was imparting instruction in English at Nagarcoil under the auspices of the London Missionary Society (LMS).  He was impressed by the school and the quality of the education given there and was convinced that the new type of school held out great prospects for the people of the state.  The school later evolved into Scott Christian College, Nagercoil.  Shortly thereafter he invited Mr. Roberts who was in-charge of the school at Nagarcoil to come to Thiruvananthapuram and start a similar school there.  The educationist, who was an Englishman, agreed and a new school was started in 1834.  The school started by Mr. Roberts has now blossomed into the University College, Thiruvananthapuram.  So Scott Christian College is also linked to University college, and both are now reputed colleges.  The alumni of the college are called Scottians.

He was a director and former executive vice president of the Mystery Writers of America, a group for which he also taught a class in mystery writing.  Aside from his seven mystery crime novels, he also published non-fiction books and articles, and mystery magazine short stories.

There's a Goat on the Roof or Poleconomy \n\n Passage: Hey Pa!  There's a Goat on the Roof was a children's board game issued by Parker Brothers in 1966. Poleconomy is a board game invented by New Zealander Bruce E. Hatherley and first published in 1980.  It is similar to Monopoly but the board is divided into companies rather than properties.  Players compete to acquire properties and investments through stylized economic and political activity.  The playing time is set by agreement from all players, e.g. 2 hours, and the winner is determined by the monetary sum of all player cash, companies, insurance or other assets.  The game can also end when there are no more companies, advertisements in the bank or bonds in the treasury.  Another objective of the game is to teach players some of the fundamentals of economics, and the ways in which the economy and the government interact.  Different editions were published for several different countries.  The name Poleconomy is a portmanteau of politics and economy.Pashmina is a fine type of cashmere wool.  The textiles made from it were first woven in Kashmir, India.  The name comes from Persian: پشمینه‎ ‎ / pašmina, meaning made from wool and literally translates to Soft Gold in Kashmiri.  Pashmina shawls are known to pass entirely through a wearable ring with diameter of about half an inch.  Pashmina came to be known as 'cashmere' in the West because Europeans first encountered this fibre in Kashmir.  The wool comes from four distinct breeds of the Cashmere goat; namely the Changthangi or Kashmir Pashmina goat from the Changthang plateau in Kashmir region, the Malra from Kargil area in Kashmir region, the Chegu from Himachal Pradesh in northern India and Pakistan, and Chyangara or Nepalese Pashmina goat from Nepal.  These shawls are hand spun, and woven in Kashmir and Nepal, and made from fine cashmere fibre. Verão Vermelho is a song by Santana which came off the album Festival.  Carlos Santana pays homage to Brazilian singer, Elis Regina.  This song features some excellent acoustic guitar with The Waters Family backing vocalists (Julia, Oren, and Maxine Willard Waters) singing the meaningless words, ”Badadup, badadup, badadup, ba pa pa ba pa pa.”  It is carried along by a marching drum beat and maracas. Santana plays a flamenco guitar solo during the intro and at the conclusion.  This is a first for him.  The flamenco guitar solo during the coda is accompanied by a keyboard flourish by Tom Coster. The Ford flathead V8 (often called simply the Ford flathead, flathead Ford, or flatty when the context is implicit, such as in hot-rodding) is a V8 engine of the valve-in-block type designed by the Ford Motor Company and built by Ford and various licensees.  During the engine's first decade of production, when overhead-valve engines were rare, it was usually known simply as the Ford V‑8, and the first car model in which it was installed, the Model 18, was (and still is) often called simply the Ford V‑8, after its new engine.  Although the V8 configuration was not new when the Ford V8 was introduced in 1932, the latter was a market first in the respect that it made an 8-cylinder affordable and a V engine affordable to the emerging mass market consumer for the first time.  It was the first independently designed and built V8 engine produced by Ford for mass production, and it ranks as one of the company's most important developments.  A fascination with ever-more-powerful engines was perhaps the most salient aspect of the American car and truck market for a half century, from 1923 until 1973.  The Ford flathead V8 was perfectly in tune with the cultural moment of its introduction, leading the way into a future of which the Ford company was a principal architect.  Thus it became a phenomenal success.  The engine design, with various changes but no major ones, was installed in Ford passenger cars and trucks until 1953, making the engine's 21-year production run for the U.S. consumer market longer than the 19-year run of the Ford Model T engine for that market.  The engine was on Ward's list of the 10 best engines of the 20th century.  It was a staple of hot rodders in the 1950s, and it remains famous in the classic car hobbies even today, despite the huge variety of other popular V8s that followed.

It is named after George Wythe, a signer of the United States Declaration of Independence, and mentor to Thomas Jefferson.  Wytheville's population was 8,211 at the 2010 census.  Located at the intersection of Interstate Highways 77 and 81, the town has long been a crossroads for travelers.  During the American Civil War, Wytheville had a strategic importance, and was attacked in 1863 (Toland's Raid) and 1865 (Stoneman's 1865 Raid).  The town is also the birthplace of Edith Bolling Wilson, wife of President Woodrow Wilson. Interstate 81 (I-81) is an 855 mi highway.  In the U.S. state of Virginia, I-81 runs for 324.92 mi , making the portion in Virginia longer than any other state's portion.  It is also the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia.  It stretches from the Tennessee state line near Bristol to the West Virginia state line near Winchester.Interstate 40 (I-40) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from Barstow, California to Wilmington, North Carolina.  In North Carolina, I-40 enters the state along the Pigeon River Gorge, from Tennessee.  Crossing the entire state, it connects the cities of Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Durham and Raleigh before ending along U.S. Highway 117/North Carolina Highway 132 (US 117/NC 132) in Wilmington.  The landscapes traversed by I-40 include the Blue Ridge Mountains, foothills of western North Carolina, suburban communities, the urban core of several Piedmont cities, along with eastern North Carolina farmland.  At a total of 423.55 mi , it is the longest interstate highway in North Carolina.  There are five auxiliary Interstates in the state related to I-40, as well as one business loop which currently runs through Winston-Salem.  The route is labeled east-west for the entire route (as are all even-numbered Interstate highways), however the eastern portion (from Hillsboro to Wilmington) follows a much more north-south alignment. There are 32 Interstate Highways—9 main routes and 23 auxiliary routes—that exist entirely or partially in the U.S. state of New York.  In New York, Interstate Highways are mostly maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), with some exceptions.  Unlike in some other states, Interstate Highways in New York are not directly referenced by NYSDOT with their number; instead, the letter I is suffixed to the number of the route on reference markers and in internal documents.  On the surface, there appears to be numerical duplication between several Interstate Highways and state routes—such as I-86 (I-86) and NY 86—but the I suffix that is appended to Interstate Highway numbers allows the Interstate Highway and state route to co-exist (86I versus 86, respectively). The Interstate Highways in Illinois are all segments of the Interstate Highway System that are owned and maintained by the U.S. state of Illinois.  The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is responsible for maintaining these highways in Illinois.  The Interstate Highway System in Illinois consists of 13 primary highways and 11 auxiliary highways which cover 2,248.93 mi .  The Interstate Highway with the longest section in Illinois is Interstate 57 at 358.57 mi ; the shortest is Interstate 41 at 0.90 mi . The following is a list of Interstate Highways in Maryland.  There are currently 16 Interstate Highways that exist entirely or partially in the U.S. state of Maryland.  Six of these are primary Interstates while ten are auxiliary Interstates related to one of the primary Interstates.

I-97 is the shortest primary Interstate at 17.62 mi and the shortest intrastate Interstate.

He served as General George Washington's chief of staff in the final years of the war. SS General von Steuben was a German passenger liner and later an armed transport in the Kriegsmarine of Nazi Germany that was sunk during World War II.

During the French Revolutionary Wars, Plampin served in a number of ships with mixed success, once being involved in a shipwreck and twice serving ashore during sieges.  After the Peace of Amiens, Plampin took command of the ship of the line HMS Powerful and operated successfully in the Atlantic and the Indian Ocean.

Mohammad Yaqub Khan ceded various frontier areas to Britain while retaining full sovereignty over Afghanistan. The Second Anglo–Afghan War (Pashto: د افغان-انګرېز دويمه جګړه) was a military conflict fought between the British Raj and the Emirate of Afghanistan from 1878 to 1880, when the latter was ruled by Sher Ali Khan of the Barakzai dynasty, the son of former Emir Dost Mohammad Khan.  This was the second time British India invaded Afghanistan.  The war ended after the British emerged victorious against the Afghan rebels and the Afghans agreed to let the British attain all of their geopolitical objectives from the Treaty of Gandamak.  Most of the British and Indian soldiers withdrew from Afghanistan.  The Afghan tribes were permitted to maintain internal rule and local customs but they had to cede control of the area's foreign relations to the British, who, in turn, guaranteed the area's freedom from foreign military domination as a buffer between the British Raj and the Russian Empire.The Emirate of Afghanistan (Pashto: د افغانستان امارت‎ Da Afghānistān Amārat ) was an emirate between Central Asia and South Asia, which is today's Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.  The emirate emerged from the Durrani Empire, when Dost Mohammed Khan, the founder of the Barakzai dynasty in Kabul, prevailed.  The history of the Emirate was dominated by 'the Great Game' between the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom for supremacy in Central Asia.  This period was characterized by the expansion of European colonial interests in South Asia.  The Emirate of Afghanistan continued the war with the Sikh Empire, which led to the invasion of Afghanistan by British-led Indian forces who completely wiped out the Afghans in 1842 but did not fulfil their initial war objectives.  However, during the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British again defeated the Afghans and this time the British took control of Afghanistan's foreign affairs until Emir Amanullah Khan regained them after the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919 was signed following the Third Anglo-Afghan War.

It follows the story of two best friends, Nate and Cat, young inventors who win a year-long scholarship at Saint Solutions, a giant skyscraper.  There, under the eye of the world's greatest inventor, Ebenezer Saint, they are given free rein to invent whatever they want.  But things take a dark turn when Saint refuses to let them leave the complex, and what started as the opportunity of a lifetime turns to a fight for not only their lives, but for the world.

This article is concerned with the history of Irish fiction written in English.  For Irish fiction written in Irish, see Modern literature in Irish.

A former mill town, Bolton has been a production centre for textiles since Flemish weavers settled in the area in the 14th century, introducing a wool and cotton-weaving tradition.  The urbanisation and development of the town largely coincided with the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution.  Bolton was a 19th-century boomtown, and at its zenith in 1929 its 216 cotton mills and 26 bleaching and dyeing works made it one of the largest and most productive centres of cotton spinning in the world.  The British cotton industry declined sharply after the First World War, and by the 1980s cotton manufacture had virtually ceased in Bolton. Rivington Hall Barn adjoins Rivington Hall in Rivington, Lancashire, near Chorley and Bolton.  The barn may date from between the 9th and 13th centuries, but more likely the 16th century, and was restored, altered and enlarged in 1905 by Jonathan Simpson for Lord Leverhulme.

These engines may be based on a number of thermodynamic cycles encompassing both open cycle devices such as those of Sir George Cayley and John Ericsson and the closed cycle engine of Robert Stirling.  Hot air engines are distinct from the better known internal combustion based engine and steam engine. Sir George Cayley, 6th Baronet (27 December 1773 – 15 December 1857) was a prolific English engineer and is one of the most important people in the history of aeronautics.  Many consider him to be the first true scientific aerial investigator and the first person to understand the underlying principles and forces of flight.Elliott J. Stoddard invented and patented two versions of the Stoddard engine, the first in 1919 and the second in 1933.  The general engine classification is an external combustion engine with valves and single-phase gaseous working fluid (i.e. a hot air engine).  The internal working fluid was originally air, although in modern versions, other gases such as helium or hydrogen may be used. Charles Stephen Boreham (19 December 1857 – 15 May 1925) was a New Zealand shearer and trade unionist.  He was born in Richmond, Tasmania, Australia on 19 December 1857. The gas-generator cycle is a power cycle of a bipropellant rocket engine.  Some of the propellant is burned in a gas generator and the resulting hot gas is used to power the engine's pumps.  The gas is then exhausted.  Because something is thrown away this type of engine is also known as open cycle. An external combustion engine (EC engine) is a heat engine where a working fluid, contained internally, is heated by combustion in an external source, through the engine wall or a heat exchanger.  The fluid then, by expanding and acting on the mechanism of the engine, produces motion and usable work.  The fluid is then cooled, compressed and reused (closed cycle), or (less commonly) dumped, and cool fluid pulled in (open cycle air engine)."}], "output": "  Sir George Cayley.**"},

The name reflects the approximate southern limit to the kingdom's territory, the Humber estuary. Northumbrian was a dialect of Old English spoken in the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria.  Together with Mercian, Kentish and West Saxon, it forms one of the sub-categories of Old English devised and employed by modern scholars.The Humberhead Levels is a national character area covering a large expanse of flat, low-lying land towards the western end of the Humber estuary in northern England.  The levels occupy the former Glacial Lake Humber, an area bounded to the east by the Yorkshire Wolds and the northern Lincolnshire Edge, a limestone escarpment, and to the west by the southern part of the Yorkshire magnesian limestone ridge.  In the north the levels merge into the slightly more undulating Vale of York close to the Escrick glacial moraine, and to the south merge into the Trent Vale. South Ferriby is a village in North Lincolnshire, England.  It is situated on the south bank of the Humber Estuary and 3 mi west from the Humber Bridge.  North Ferriby is directly opposite on the Estuary’s north bank.  Village population was 651 in 2011. The Essex dialect is a rapidly disappearing dialect similar to some forms of East Anglian English and is now mainly confined to the north and the east of Essex.  It shares vast similarities with both Suffolk and Norfolk dialects, with its own peculiarities.  With rapid urbanisation in the twentieth century as well as the impact of the London overspill, Estuary English, a milder form of the London accent predominant largely along the Thames Estuary and thus the name, has become common, mainly in the southern portion of the county.  As a result of the growing London influence, the usage of rural accents everywhere and the rural Essex dialect is now normally, but not always, confined to older generations in some of the areas affected and the dialect itself stands in a vulnerable state in those affected parts of the county.  Elsewhere in Essex, the dialect and rural accent continues. Humberside was a non-metropolitan and ceremonial county in Northern England from 1 April 1974 until 1 April 1996.  It was composed of land from either side of the Humber Estuary, created from portions of East Riding of Yorkshire, West Riding of Yorkshire, and the district of Lindsey, Lincolnshire.  The county council's headquarters was County Hall at Beverley, inherited from the East Riding, and its largest settlement and only city was Kingston upon Hull.  The county stretched from Wold Newton in its northern tip to a different Wold Newton at its most southern point.  The county still has a limited existence in the form of the Hull and Humber Ports city region."}], "output": "  Northumbrian.**"},

As of the 2010 census, the population was 60,316.  Its county seat is La Grange.  The county is named for Colonel William Oldham.  Oldham County was a prohibition or completely dry county until January 2005 as the result of a 2004 'moist' vote, permitting sales of alcohol in restaurants that seat at least 100 patrons in which 70%+ of total revenue is derived from sales of food.  After a vote in late 2015; Oldham county has become a completely wet county. Lake Louisvilla is a neighborhood partially located in Louisville, Kentucky.  It is located between Westport Road in Louisville and KY 22 in Oldham County.  Lake Louisvilla was developed in the 1920s as a summer resort for people living in the city of Louisville.

The first county-lieutenant and military governor of Kentucky County during the American Revolutionary War, Col. Bowman also, served in the American Revolution, many times, second in command to General George Rogers Clark, during the Illinois Campaign, which, at the time, doubled the size of the United States. Benjamin Logan (c.1742 – December 11, 1802) was an American pioneer, soldier, and politician from Shelby County, Kentucky.  As colonel of the Kentucky County, Virginia militia during the American Revolutionary War, he was second-in-command of all the militia in Kentucky.  He was also a leader in Kentucky's efforts to become a state.  His brother, John Logan, was the first state treasurer of Kentucky. The Battle of Blue Licks, fought on August 19, 1782, was one of the last battles of the American Revolutionary War.  The battle occurred ten months after Lord Cornwallis's famous surrender at Yorktown, which had effectively ended the war in the east.  On a hill next to the Licking River in what is now Robertson County, Kentucky (but was then in Kentucky County, Virginia), a force of about 50 American and Canadian Loyalists along with 300 American Indians ambushed and routed 182 Kentucky militiamen.  It was the last victory for the Loyalists and Natives during the frontier war. John Logan (1747July 1807) was a pioneer and politician from the U.S. state of Virginia and later, Kentucky.  He participated in Lord Dunmore's War in 1774, serving under his brother, Benjamin.  After moving to Kentucky County, Virginia, he took part in several expeditions against the Shawnee, including some led by Daniel Boone, John Bowman, and George Rogers Clark.  After Kentucky County was split into three counties, Logan represented his home county, Lincoln in the Virginia House of Delegates and at several of the conventions that effected the separation of Virginia from Kentucky."}], "output": "  The Kentucky county with a population of 60,316 and featuring the Lake Louisvilla neighborhood is Oldham County.**"},

The collection was published in 1928.  The article argues that it is no coincidence that some of the greatest works of world literature - including Oedipus Rex, Hamlet, as well as The Brothers Karamazov – all concern parricide, which in Dostoevsky's case Freud links to his epilepsy. Oedipus Rex, also known by its Greek title, Oedipus Tyrannus (Ancient Greek: Οἰδίπους Τύραννος IPA: [oidípuːs týranːos]), or Oedipus the King, is an Athenian tragedy by Sophocles that was first performed around 429 BC.  Originally, to the ancient Greeks, the title was simply Oedipus (Οἰδίπους), as it is referred to by Aristotle in the Poetics.  It is thought to have been renamed Oedipus Tyrannus to distinguish it from Oedipus at Colonus.  In antiquity, the term “tyrant” referred to a ruler, but it did not necessarily have a negative connotation.The Interpretation of Dreams (German: Die Traumdeutung ) is a 1899 book by psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, in which the author introduces his theory of the unconscious with respect to dream interpretation, and discusses what would later become the theory of the Oedipus complex.  Freud revised the book at least eight times and, in the third edition, added an extensive section which treated dream symbolism very literally, following the influence of Wilhelm Stekel.  Freud said of this work, Insight such as this falls to one's lot but once in a lifetime. Freud: A Life for Our Time is a 1988 biography of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, by the historian Peter Gay.  The work is based partly on new material that has become available since the publication of Ernest Jones' The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud (1953).  The book has been praised, but has also been criticized by several authors skeptical of psychoanalysis. From its premiere at the turn of the 17th century, Hamlet has remained Shakespeare's best-known, most-imitated, and most-analyzed play.  The character of Hamlet played a critical role in Sigmund Freud's explanation of the Oedipus complex and thus influenced modern psychology.  Even within the narrower field of literature, the play's influence has been strong.  As Foakes writes, No other character's name in Shakespeare's plays, and few in literature, have come to embody an attitude to life [...] and been converted into a noun in this way. Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation (French: De l'interprétation.  Essai sur Sigmund Freud ) is a 1965 book about Sigmund Freud by the philosopher Paul Ricœur.  Sometimes grouped with works such as Jürgen Habermas's Knowledge and Human Interests (1968), Freud and Philosophy has received praise, but critics have argued Ricœur provides a mistaken interpretation of Freud."}], "output": "  The work of literature being referred to in the passage is \"Oedipus Tyrannus\" or \"Oedipus Rex,\" which is an Athenian tragedy by Sophocles."},

Erected before the Rostra and dedicated or rededicated in honour of the Eastern Roman Emperor Phocas on August 1, 608, it was the last addition made to the Forum Romanum.  The fluted Corinthian column stands 13.6 m (44 ft) tall on its cubical white marble socle.  On stylistic grounds, the column seems to have been made in the 2nd century for an unknown structure, and then recycled for the present monument.  Likewise, the socle was recycled from its original use supporting a statue dedicated to Diocletian; the former inscription was chiselled away to provide a space for the later text. The Colonna dell'Abbondanza is a monumental column located in the Piazza della Repubblica in Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy.

It has only been recorded from Endau-Rompin National Park, Johor, in closed-canopy lowland forests in the early evening following brief periods of afternoon precipitation.  It is called gollum with reference of the eponymous character of The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by English author and scholar J. R. R. Tolkien.  The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, but eventually developed into a much larger work.  Written in stages between 1937 and 1949, The Lord of the Rings is one of the best-selling novels ever written, with over 150 million copies sold.Suanfa tongzong (General Source of Computational Methods) is a mathematical text written by sixteenth century Chinese mathematician Cheng Dawei (1533–1606) and published in the year 1592.  The book contains 595 problems divided into 17 chapters.  The book is essentially general arithmetic for the abacus.  The book was the main source available to scholars concerning mathematics as it developed in China’s tradition.  Six years after the publication of Suanfa Tongzong, Cheng Dawei published another book titled Suanfa Zuanyao (A Compendium of calculating Methods).  About 90% of the content of the new book came from the contents of four chapters of the first book with some rearrangement.  It is said that when Suanfa Tongzong was first published, it sold so many copies that the cost of paper went up and the lucrative sales resulted in unscrupulous people beginning to print pirated copies of the book with many errors.  it was this that forced the author to print an abridged version. Gollum is a fictional character from J. R. R. Tolkien's legendarium.  He was introduced in the 1937 fantasy novel The Hobbit, and became an important supporting character in its sequel, The Lord of the Rings.  Gollum was a Stoor Hobbit of the River-folk, who lived near the Gladden Fields.  Originally known as Sméagol, he was corrupted by the One Ring and later named Gollum after his habit of making a horrible swallowing noise in his throat. The cosmological interpretation of quantum mechanics, proposed by Anthony Aguirre and Max Tegmark, is an interpretation of quantum mechanics that applies in the context of eternal cosmological inflation, which arguably predicts an infinite three-dimensional space with infinitely many planets and infinitely many copies of any quantum system.  According to this interpretation, the wavefunction for a quantum system describes not some imaginary ensemble of possibilities for what the system might be doing, but rather the actual spatial collection of identical copies of the system that exist in our infinite space.  Its collapse can be avoided.  Moreover, the quantum uncertainty that you experience simply reflects your inability to self-locate in space, i.e., to know which of your infinitely many copies throughout space is the one having your subjective perceptions. Gollum details how a three-week commission for Andy Serkis to provide a voice-over for Gollum grew into a five-year commitment to breathe life and soul into The Lord of the Rings' most challenging creation.  Andy Serkis tackles various subjects throughout the book, including character conception (Gollum's cough is derived from his cat coughing up a hairball) as well as the hard work it took to act out Gollum and replace it with CGI.  He also discusses the controversy of whether he should have been eligible for an Academy Award for his work as Gollum."}], "output": "  Over 150 million copies.**"},

Sims, 377 U.S. 533 (1964) was a United States Supreme Court case that ruled that unlike in the election of the United States Senate, in the election of any chamber of a state legislature the electoral districts must be roughly equal in population (thus negating the traditional function of a State Senate, which was to allow rural counties to counter balance large towns and cities).  The case was brought on behalf of voters in Alabama by M.O. Sims, a taxpayer in Birmingham, Alabama, but affected both northern and southern states that had similarly failed to reapportion their legislatures in keeping with changes in state population after its application in five companion cases in Colorado, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware. Selle v. Gibb, 741 F.2d 896 (7th Cir.  1984) was a landmark ruling on the doctrine of striking similarities.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled that while copying must be proved by access and substantial similarity, where evidence of access does not exist, striking similarities may raise an inference of copying by showing that the work could not have been the result of independent creation, coincidence, or common source.  Striking similarity alone is not enough to infer access.  The similarity must preclude independent creation in order to infer access.West v. Barnes, 2 U.S. 401 (1791), was the first United States Supreme Court decision and the earliest case calling for oral argument.  Van Staphorst v. Maryland (1791) was docketed prior to West v. Barnes but settled before the Court heard the case: West was argued on August 2, 1791 and decided on August 3, 1791.  Collet v. Collet (1791) was the first appellate case docketed with the Court but was dropped before it could be heard.  Supreme Court Reporter Alexander Dallas did not publish the justices' full opinions in West v. Barnes, which were published in various newspapers around the country at the time, but he published an abbreviated summary of the decisions. Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd was a House of Lords case in English defamation law concerning qualified privilege for publication of defamatory statements in the public interest. George Reynolds (January 1, 1842 – August 9, 1909) was a general authority of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), a longtime secretary to the First Presidency of the LDS Church, and a party to the 1878 United States Supreme Court case Reynolds v. United States, the first freedom of religion case to issue from that court. Jameel v Wall Street Journal Europe was a House of Lords judgment on English defamation law.  The judgment was an affirmation of Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd and effectively upholds a public interest defence in libel cases."}], "output": "  Reynolds v. Sims was decided first.

Arrowhead has a seating capacity of 76,416, making it the 28th largest stadium in North America and sixth largest NFL stadium.  It is also the largest sports facility by capacity in the state of Missouri.  A $375 million renovation was completed in 2010. Charles Utter Deaton (January 1, 1921 – December 18, 1996) was an American architect.  He designed several athletic stadiums, and is noted for his futuristic Sculptured House that was featured in the 1973 film Sleeper.  He is also noted as the designer of Kansas City's Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium.The 2016 Kansas City Royals season was the 48th for the franchise, and their 44th at Kauffman Stadium.  The Royals entered the season as the defending World Series champions determined to become the first team since the 1999 New York Yankees to win back-to-back World Series titles.

The battle has become a key component of the lore of the United States Marine Corps. The Battle of Peleliu, codenamed Operation Stalemate II by the United States military, was fought between the U.S. and the Empire of Japan during the Mariana & Palau Campaign of World War II, from September to November 1944, on the island of Peleliu.Clifton B. Cates (born Clifton Bledsoe Cates; August 31, 1893 – June 4, 1970) was a senior officer of the United States Marine Corps who served as the 19th Commandant of the Marine Corps from 1948 to 1951.

As one who fought in some of the most fiercest fighting of the time, he had the respect of the Marines.  In World War I, he fought in the Battle of Belleau Wood with the 5th Marine Regiment.  In 1930, between the wars, he was stationed in Shanghai and played in the outfield for the Fourth Marine Regiment Baseball Team.  He also served in France, Nicaragua, Iceland and on the Amazon.

The plant belongs to the nightshade family, which is called Solanaceae. Wheat salad (Arabic: سلطة قمح‎ ‎ ), is a salad of Arab salads, it typically of wheat, corn, tomatoes, carrots, cucumber pickles, lemon, parsley, olive oil and salt.Fruit salad is a dish consisting of various kinds of fruit, sometimes served in a liquid, either in their own juices or a syrup.  When served as an appetizer or as a dessert, a fruit salad is sometimes known as a fruit cocktail or fruit cup.  In different forms fruit salad can be served as an appetizer, a side-salad, or a dessert. A salad bar is a buffet-style table or counter at a restaurant or food market on which salad components are provided for customers to assemble their own salad plates.  Most salad bars provide lettuce, chopped tomatoes, assorted raw, sliced vegetables (such as cucumbers, carrots, celery, olives and green or red bell peppers), dried bread croutons, bacon bits, shredded cheese, and various types of salad dressing.  Some salad bars also have additional food items such as cooked cold meats, (turkey, chicken, ham, or tuna), cooked beans (e.g., chick peas, garbanzo beans or kidney beans), boiled eggs, cottage cheese, cold pasta salads, tortilla chips, bread rolls, soup, and fresh cut fruit slices. Wheat allergy is an allergy which typically presents itself as a food allergy, but can also be a contact allergy resulting from occupational exposure to wheat.  Like all allergies, wheat allergy involves immunoglobulin E and mast cell response.  Typically the allergy is limited to the seed storage proteins of wheat, some reactions are restricted to wheat proteins, while others can react across many varieties of seeds and other plant tissues.  Wheat allergy may be a misnomer since there are many allergenic components in wheat, for example serine protease inhibitors, glutelins and prolamins and different responses are often attributed to different proteins.  Twenty-seven potential wheat allergens have been successfully identified.  The most severe response is exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis attributed to one omega gliadin that is a relative of the protein that causes celiac disease.  Other more common symptoms include nausea, urticaria, atopy.  Gluten sensitivity is not usually classified as a wheat allergy. Crataegus pinnatifida, also known as mountain hawthorn, Chinese haw, Chinese hawthorn or Chinese hawberry, refers to a small to medium-sized tree, as well as the fruit of the tree.

The term originated in the social and economic world of Italian opera, in which from the mid-18th century to the 1830s, the impresario was the key figure in the organization of a lyric season.  The owners of the theatre, usually noble amateurs, charged the impresario with hiring a composer (until the 1850s operas were expected to be new) and the orchestra, singers, costumes and sets, all while assuming considerable financial risk.  In 1786 Mozart satirized the stress and emotional mayhem in a single-act farce Der Schauspieldirektor (The Impresario).  Antonio Vivaldi was unusual in acting as both impresario and composer; in 1714 he managed seasons at Teatro San Angelo in Venice, where his opera Orlando finto pazzo was followed by numerous others.

These carriers can use a variety of shipping modes, including ships, airplanes, trucks, and railroads, and often multiple modes for a single shipment.  For example, the freight forwarder may arrange to have cargo moved from a plant to an airport by truck, flown to the destination city, then moved from the airport to a customer's building by another truck.

Known commonly in North America as andromedas or fetterbushes, they are broad-leaved evergreen shrubs growing to 1 - tall and 3 - wide.  The leaves are spirally arranged, often appearing to be in whorls at the end of each shoot with bare stretches of shoot below; they are lanceolate-ovate, 2 - long and 1.0 - broad, leathery textured, and with an entire or serrated margin.  The young leaves in spring are typically brightly coloured.  The flowers are bell-shaped, 5 - long, white or pink, and arranged in racemes 5 - long.  The fruit is a woody capsule which splits into five sections to release the numerous small seeds. Phlebodium is a small genus of two to four species of ferns, native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas.  The genus is closely related to Polypodium, and the species were formerly included in that genus.Sinopieris is a genus of butterflies in the family Pieridae.  The genus occurs in Nepal, Tibet, Yunnan, Gansu, Shaanxi and Sichuan.  All six species were originally included in Pieris.  The two genera are distinguished by the venation in the apical area of the forewing.  Most Sinopieris species have a suffused grey or blackish post-discal band whereas Pieris usually have a single (males) or a pair (females) of blackish post-discal spots on the forewings, and no trace of any spot or band on the hindwings. The andromeda lace bug (Stephanitis takeyai) is a pest insect on plants of the genus Pieris, especially Pieris japonica, the Japanese andromeda.  It originated in Japan with its host plant but has since been introduced to other areas of the globe.  At least one Pieris species, Pieris floribunda, is resistant to the bug. Leptosporangiate ferns are the largest group of living ferns, including some 11000 species worldwide.  They constitute the subclass Polypodiidae, but are often considered to be the class Pteridopsida or Polypodiopsida, although other classifications assign them a different rank.  The leptosporangiate ferns are one of the four major groups of ferns, with the other three being the Eusporangiate ferns comprising the marattioid ferns (Marattiidae, Marattiaceae), the horsetails (Equisetiidae, Equisetaceae), and whisk ferns and moonworts. Pieris floribunda is a North American species of broadleaf evergreen shrub, a member of the fetterbush genus in the blueberry family (Ericaceae).  It is commonly known in North America as mountain fetterbush or mountain andromeda.  All parts of Pieris floribunda are poisonous if ingested.  It is a rare plant to find in landscapes because it is difficult to propagate and it often does not adapt well to cultivation.  However, there are a few specialty and native plant nurseries that sell some, overcoming the more difficult propagation.  In landscapes it should be grown in full to part shade, out of windy locations, and have a good quality soil with lots of organic matter that is acid of pH 4.5 to 6.5"}], "output": "  Yes, Phlebodium and Pieris are both species of ferns.**"},

The bridge is 30 ft long and 42 ft wide, with its elliptical arch reaching a height of 13 ft above the river.  The facing of the bridge is rough-cut granite that has been fixed with mortar.  In contrast, the granite stones that make up the arch have been very precisely worked.  The bridge has parapet walls made of large granite slabs 4.5 ft , 2 ft wide, and 1 ft thick. Worcester ( , ] ) is a city and the county seat of Worcester County, Massachusetts, United States.  Named after Worcester, England, as of the 2010 Census the city's population was 181,045, making it the second most populous city in New England after Boston.  Worcester is located approximately 40 mi west of Boston, 50 mi east of Springfield and 40 mi north of Providence.  Due to its location in Central Massachusetts, Worcester is known as the Heart of the Commonwealth, thus, a heart is the official symbol of the city.  However, the heart symbol may also have its provenance in lore that the mass-produced Valentine's Day card was invented in the city.The Sutliff Bridge is a bridge over the Cedar River at Sutliff, a Johnson County community near Lisbon, Iowa, United States.  A Parker truss bridge, it was built in 1897 and 1898 at a cost of approximately $12,000.  J.R. Sheely was the engineer for the original Sutliff Bridge.  After a modern replacement was built over the Cedar in 1983, the bridge was slated for destruction, but it was ultimately saved, and on May 15, 1998, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.  Although the bridge remained a celebrated location for locals and for visitors from across Iowa, including a 5k foot race beloved as the “worst road race in America, it succumbed to massive floods in the second week of June 2008: while the river normally flowed many feet below the bottom of the bridge, the floods topped the bridge's deck, and one of the bridge's spans was washed away on June 13 as the surrounding countryside was inundated with vast amounts of water.  It is estimated that restoring the bridge will cost $1.7 million.  Most of this money would come from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), with the rest coming from donations and local governments; both FEMA and the Johnson County Board of Supervisors have agreed in principle to repair the bridge.  The bridge reconstruction was supervised by VJ Engineering of Coralville, Iowa and construction was completed by Iowa Bridge and Culvert of Washington, Iowa.  In October 2012 a ribbon cutting ceremony was held opening the bridge to public use for the first time in four years. The Gardnerville Branch Jail is a historic jail located at 1440 Courthouse St. in Gardnerville, Nevada.  The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915.  Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary.  As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail.  However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself.  Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail.  The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him.  Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail. The Cerro Gordo County Courthouse is located in Mason City, Iowa, United States.  When Cerro Gordo County was created in 1855 and Mason City was selected to be the county seat.  Dissatisfaction in the western part of the county led the Iowa legislature to appoint three new commissioners who would move the county seat to Livonia.  A courthouse was built there.  A petition signed by over half of the citizens of the county requested that the county seat be moved back to Mason City.  Mason City also won the election in 1858 to decide the matter 155-48.  Two courthouses have stood in Mason City prior to the present Modernist structure that was occupied by the county in 1960.  It had been built as the Standard Oil Building, and was acquired by the county in 1959 for $159,400 and then remodeled for their use. The Old Allamakee County Courthouse, located on 2nd Street in Lansing, is a short-lived former county courthouse of Allamakee County, Iowa.  The courthouse was completed in 1861 amid a fight between Lansing and Waukon over which community deserved to be the county seat.  Lansing had lost a vote on the county seat to Waukon in 1859, but they won another vote in 1861 after teaming up with the community of Columbus.  Waukon built its own courthouse in the meantime, but it failed to win back the county seat in yet another vote in 1864.  The county sheriff, a Waukon resident, attempted to seize the county's records from the Lansing courthouse in 1866; however, a posse from Lansing stopped him before he could return to Waukon.  The Iowa Supreme Court decided the county seat battle in favor of Waukon the following year; it has remained there since."}], "output": "  The engineer who built Bartlett's Bridge was Charles A.

G. Farrell or Louis Aragon, wrote of the political and human consequences of his country's colonial rule? \n\n Passage: James Gordon Farrell (25 January 1935 – 11 August 1979) was a Liverpool-born novelist of Irish descent.  He gained prominence for a series of novels known as the Empire Trilogy (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), which deal with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. Louis Aragon (] , 3 October 1897 – 24 December 1982) was a French poet, who was one of the leading voices of the surrealist movement in France, who co-founded with André Breton and Philippe Soupault the surrealist review Littérature.  He was also a novelist and editor, a long-time member of the Communist Party and a member of the Académie Goncourt.The Murree Rebellion of 1857, sometimes termed a war of Independence, was part of the Indian Rebellion of 1857.  It was a rebel skirmish between the tribes surrounding the Hill Station of Murree (in modern-day Pakistan) and the colonial government of British India.  Resentment toward colonial rule had been mounting for many years following the British establishment in the subcontinent.  There had been occasional isolated uprisings toward the British.  The significance of the 1857 events was that, although not centrally coordinated, the uprisings had the feel of something much larger with real anticipation that colonial rule would be overthrown. According to the Republic of Niger's Constitution of 1999, most human rights, as defined by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, are upheld and protected.  Despite these protections, concerns of both domestic and international human rights organizations have been raised over the behavior of the government, military, police forces, and over the continuation of traditional practices which contravene the 1999 constitution.  Under French colonial rule (1900–1960) and from independence until 1992, citizens of Niger had few political rights, and lived under arbitrary government power.  Although the situation has improved since the return to civilian rule, criticisms remain over the state of human rights in the country. The 1985 Hong Kong electoral reform introduced the first ever indirect election to the colonial legislature during the last years of the British colonial rule in Hong Kong.  The reform proposals was first carried out in the Green Paper: the Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong in July 1984 right before the Sino-British Joint Declaration in December.  The reform laid the foundation of the representative democracy in Hong Kong which developed throughout the last years of the colonial rule and succeeded by the democratic development in Hong Kong after the handover of Hong Kong in 1997. Les Chansons d'Aragon (English: Songs of Aragon) is an album by Léo Ferré, released in 1961 by Barclay Records.  It is his second album dedicated to a poet, after Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du mal in 1957.  Here, Ferré focuses on former surrealist Louis Aragon, but the body of work he chooses (poetry collection Le Roman inachevé, mostly) is not surrealistic."}], "output": "  J.G.

The series features a species of nocturnal creatures known as gargoyles that turn to stone during the day.  After spending a thousand years in an enchantedly petrified state, the gargoyles (who have been transported from medieval Scotland) are reawakened in modern-day New York City, and take on roles as the city's secret night-time protectors. Gargoyles the Movie: The Heroes Awaken is a direct-to-video animated film from The Walt Disney Company.  The film is actually the five-episode pilot (Awakening) of the animated television series Gargoyles edited into one long feature film, approximately 100 minutes in length.  As a result, numerous scenes from the original broadcast episodes were cut due to time constraints.  In addition, a number of scenes were also moved around and some dialogues were changed.  The episodes were produced and aired in 1994, and the film was released to laserdisc and VHS in February 1995 and featured an interactive VHS/LD board game.  As the pilot episodes have been released to DVD as part of Gargoyles: Season 1, this feature is unlikely to be released independently again.Desert kites are constructions aimed at trapping game animals, found in the Middle East.  Known to the local Bedouin as the Works of the Old Men, are found across the deserts of Syria, Jordan, Southern Israel and Saudi Arabia.  They are believed to have been used for hunting wild animals and consist of long dry-stone walls converging on a neck which opens into a confined space which was used as the killing floor.  The length of the walls can run to hundreds of metres and can be best seen from the air.  They were given their name by pilots who first saw them from the air in the 1920s.  Almost 2,000 have been identified across Jordan and Syria.  No research has been done across the Saudi Arabian Desert.  Modern research has proven that the desert kites were mainly used for hunting herds of migrating goitered or Persian gazelle, a species which became extinct in Southern Levant during the 19th century.  Most desert kites have been dated through scientific methods to be between 3 and 5 thousand years old.  The claim of older ages (8 to 9 thousand years) has been contradicted by more recent studies.  Younger dates mean that the mass hunting did not occur in prehistory and was not done by hunter-gatherers, but during a later period, by agriculturalists who were already growing most of their food.  Rock art in the vicinity of some of the kites indicates that the hunt could represent a large social effort, done together by people from several settlements, and showing religious connotations. The 2000 Race of a Thousand Years was an endurance race and the final round of the 2000 American Le Mans Series.  It was run on the Adelaide Street Circuit in Australia on New Year's Eve, 31 December 2000.  The race was run on the full 3.780 km (2.349 mi) Grand Prix circuit used by Formula One for the Australian Grand Prix between 1985-1995, rather than the shorter 3.219 km (2.012 mi) V8 Supercars version of the circuit used since 1999.  The Race of a Thousand Years was intended to be run for 1000 kilometres but was stopped short due to time constraints, two hours before midnight, after completing 850 kilometres. A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, subtitled What I Learned While Editing My Life, is the sixth book by Donald Miller.  After writing a successful book, author Donald Miller's life stalled.  Instead of enjoying the fruits of his labor, Miller had slipped into a dark point in his life.  He had no desire to participate in the daily responsibility of life and found himself questioning what his purpose was.  While in this slump he was approached by two movie producers wanting to turn his book into a movie.  A Million Miles in a Thousand Years centers on the realizations that Miller came to while editing his successful memoir Blue Like Jazz into a screenplay for a movie, directed by Steve Taylor. Escalante Petrified Forest State Park (also known as Escalante State Park) is a state park of Utah, USA, located a half-mile (0.8 km) north of the town of Escalante.  A visitor center was built in 1991, and features displays of plant and marine fossils, petrified wood and fossilized dinosaur bones over 150 million years old (Upper Jurassic Period).  The Petrified Forest Trail is a one-mile (1.6 km) loop, winding up the side of a mesa to the top where most of the fossil wood occurs.  Logs two feet or more in diameter are seen at several places along the trail where it is eroding from the conglomerate capping the mesa.  This conglomerate lies near the top of the Brushy Basin Member of the Morrison Formation.  The wood is multicolored (mostly red, yellow, white, and black) and was prized by hobbyists before the Park was established.  The logs are believed to be of conifers that were transported by a river before being buried and later fossilized as agate.  A 50 foot (15m) log is displayed near the trail head and is one of the most complete fossil logs known from the Morrison Formation."}], "output": "  The characters from Gargoyles the Movie: The Heroes Awaken woke up in modern-day New York City.**"},

He currently resides in Brooklyn, New York .The imprest system is a form of financial accounting system.  The most common imprest system is the petty cash system.  The base characteristic of an imprest system is that a fixed amount is reserved, which after a certain period of time or when circumstances require, because money was spent, it will be replenished.  This replenishment will come from another account source, e.g., petty cash will be replenished by cashing a cheque drawn on a bank account. W. Morgan Petty is the creation of Brian Bethell.  W. Morgan Petty would write crank letters to numerous organizations expressing typical concerns for mid-1980s Britain like nuclear war and the common market.  Collections of his letters include: Uterine cancer or womb cancer is any type of cancer that emerges from the tissue of the uterus.  It can refer to several types of cancer, with cervical cancer (arising from the lower portion of the uterus) being the most common type worldwide and the second most common cancer in women in developing countries.  Endometrial cancer (or cancer of the inner lining of the uterus) is the second most common type, and fourth most common cancer in women from developed countries.  Risk factors depend on specific type, but obesity, older age, and human papillomavirus infection add the greatest risk of developing uterine cancer.  Early on, there may be no symptoms, but irregular vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain or fullness may develop.  If caught early, most types of uterine cancer can be cured using surgical or medical methods.  When the cancer has extended beyond the uterine tissue, more advanced treatments including combinations of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery may be required. Petty treason or petit treason was an offence under the common law of England which involved the betrayal (including murder) of a superior by a subordinate.  It differed from the better-known high treason in that high treason can only be committed against the Sovereign.  In England and Wales, petty treason ceased to be a distinct offence from murder by virtue of the Offences against the Person Act 1828.  It was abolished in Ireland in 1829.  It never existed in Scotland.  It has also been abolished in other common-law countries."}], "output": "  J.T. Petty and Outlast share the commonality of being related to the horror genre. J.T.

The Heisman curse is a term coined to reference a two-part assertion of a negative future for the winning player of the Heisman Trophy.  The curse supposes that any college football player who wins the Heisman plays on a team that will likely lose its subsequent bowl game.  The trend of post-award failure has garnered the attention of the mainstream media.  Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1–5 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4–8 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1–6).  Additionally, the Heisman curse asserts that in most cases a Heisman winner will have either a poor career in the National Football League (NFL), or in fact not even see such a football career at all.  Although many Heisman winners have not enjoyed success at the professional level, including players like Matt Leinart, Andre Ware, Jason White, Rashaan Salaam, Eric Crouch, Ty Detmer, Troy Smith and Gino Torretta, proponents of the curse rarely cite highly successful players such as Barry Sanders, Charles Woodson, Eddie George, Tim Brown, Bo Jackson, Marcus Allen, Earl Campbell, and Tony Dorsett among the notables.

An exemplar of Mid-Century modern design, Risom was one of the first designers to introduce Scandinavian design in the United States. Scandinavian design is a design movement characterized by simplicity, minimalism and functionality that emerged in the 1950s in the five Nordic countries of Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Denmark.

Conventional ERP software work in a data entry and processing model.  Mr. Charles Lim changed that when he introduced the first WRP software that incorporates workflow functionality into its core design and released this new ERP called Radix ERP.  Work flow functionality was not new.  Lotus Notes was the pioneer of workflow systems until it went out of favor in early 2000.  From the designs of Lotus Notes, Mr. Charles combined the idea into ERP systems and created Radix WRP, a new class of ERP system with workflow manageability. An NTFS symbolic link (symlink) is a filesystem object in the NTFS filesystem that points to another filesystem object.  The object being pointed to is called the target.  Symbolic links should be transparent to users; the links appear as normal files or directories, and can be acted upon by the user or application in exactly the same manner.  Symbolic links to directories or volumes, called junction points and mount points, were introduced with NTFS 3.0 that shipped with Windows 2000.  From NTFS 3.1 onwards, symbolic links can be created for any kind of file system object.  NTFS 3.1 was introduced together with Windows XP, but the functionality was not made available (through ntfs.sys) to user mode applications.  Third-party filter drivers such as Masatoshi Kimura's opensource codice_1 driver could however be installed to make the feature available in user mode as well.  The ntfs.sys released with Windows Vista made the functionality available to user mode applications by default. Jens Ritter Instruments is a manufacturer of high-end electric stringed instruments.

Bio-inspired robotic locomotion is a fairly new subcategory of bio-inspired design.  It is about learning concepts from nature and applying them to the design of real-world engineered systems.  More specifically, this field is about making robots that are inspired by biological systems.  Biomimicry and bio-inspired design are sometimes confused.  Biomimicry is copying the nature while bio-inspired design is learning from nature and making a mechanism that is simpler and more effective than the system observed in nature.  Biomimicry has led to the development of a different branch of robotics called soft robotics.  The biological systems have been optimized for specific tasks according to their habitat.  However, they are multifunctional and are not designed for only one specific functionality.  Bio-inspired robotics is about studying biological systems, and look for the mechanisms that may solve a problem in the engineering field.  The designer should then try to simplify and enhance that mechanism for the specific task of interest.  Bio-inspired roboticists are usually interested in biosensors (e.g. eye), bioactuators (e.g. muscle), or biomaterials (e.g. spider silk).  Most of the robots have some type of locomotion system.  Thus, in this article different modes of animal locomotion and few examples of the corresponding bio-inspired robots are introduced."}], "output": "  Jens Risom introduced Scandinavian design, which is characterized by simplicity, minimalism, and functionality.**"},

Construction on the stadium began in 1962, and it officially opened in 1965.  It served as home to the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball (MLB) from its opening in 1965 until 1999, and the home to the Houston Oilers of the National Football League (NFL) from 1968 until 1996, and also the part-time home of the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1971 until 1975.  Additionally, the Astrodome was the primary venue of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo from 1966 until 2002.  When opened, it was named the Harris County Domed Stadium and was nicknamed the Eighth Wonder of the World. Eighth Wonder of the World is an unofficial title sometimes given to new buildings, structures, projects, or even designs that are deemed to be comparable to the seven Wonders of the World.For the Last Time: Live From the Astrodome is the first live album released by George Strait in 2003.  The title refers to the fact that this concert was the final event that took place at the Houston Astrodome. Live!  The Last Concert is a live album by American singer Selena.  It was recorded on February 26, 1995, at the Houston Astrodome and was televised live on Univision.  The album was posthumously released by EMI Latin on March 27, 2001.  The singer shared the concert with Tejano singer Emilio Navaira and performed to 66,994 people, which broke the previous attendance record held by Selena the previous year.  The concert was critically acclaim for outperforming ticket sales by country music singers Vince Gill, Reba Mcentire, and George Strait.  Selena's performance at the astrodome became her final televised concert before she was shot and killed on March 31, 1995. The 1973 Astro-Bluebonnet Bowl, part of the 1973 bowl game season, took place on December 29, 1973, at the Houston Astrodome in Houston, Texas.

Human eyes perceive blue when observing light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometres. Blues with a higher frequency and thus a shorter wavelength appear more violet, while those with a lower frequency and a longer wavelength gradually appear more green.  Pure blue, in the middle, has a wavelength of 470 nanometres.  In painting and traditional colour theory, blue is one of the three primary colours of pigments, along with red and yellow, which can be mixed to form a wide gamut of colours.  Red and blue mixed together form violet, blue and yellow together form green.  Blue is also a primary colour in the RGB colour model, used to create all the colours on the screen of a television or computer monitor. Innocent Records was a pop record label created to cater to for EMI's Virgin Records more pop oriented acts.  Following the success of the Spice Girls, Virgin Records decided to delve into the pop market.  In doing so they poached Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records (famous for steering Take That's initial flagging sales, to a multi-platinum act).  They let him launch his own Virgin Records offshoot.  His first signing was Billie Piper, followed by Martine McCutcheon, along with several dance acts Todd Terry to name one.  The label continued to thrive well into the mid-2000s with Atomic Kitten and Blue achieving Platinum sales.The ProPhoto RGB color space, also known as ROMM RGB (Reference Output Medium Metric), is an output referred RGB color space developed by Kodak.  It offers an especially large gamut designed for use with photographic output in mind.  The ProPhoto RGB color space encompasses over 90% of possible surface colors in the CIE L*a*b* color space, and 100% of likely occurring real-world surface colors documented by Pointer in 1980, making ProPhoto even larger than the Wide-gamut RGB color space.  The ProPhoto RGB primaries were also chosen in order to minimize hue rotations associated with non-linear tone scale operations.  One of the downsides to this color space is that approximately 13% of the representable colors are imaginary colors that do not exist and are not visible colors. The YCoCg color model is the color space formed from a simple transformation of an associated RGB color space into a luma value (denoted as Y) and two chroma values called chrominance green (Cg) and chrominance orange (Co).  It is supported in video and image compression designs such as H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, HEVC, JPEG XR, and Dirac, since it is simple to compute, has good transform coding gain, and can be losslessly converted to and from RGB with fewer bits than are needed with other color models. A color space is a specific organization of colors.  In combination with physical device profiling, it allows for reproducible representations of color, in both analog and digital representations.  A color space may be arbitrary, with particular colors assigned to a set of physical color swatches and corresponding assigned names or numbers such as with the Pantone collection, or structured mathematically, as with NCS System, Adobe RGB or sRGB.  A color model is an abstract mathematical model describing the way colors can be represented as tuples of numbers (e.g. triples in RGB or quadruples in CMYK); however, a color model with no associated mapping function to an absolute color space is a more or less arbitrary color system with no connection to any globally understood system of color interpretation.  Adding a specific mapping function between a color model and a reference color space establishes within the reference color space a definite footprint, known as a gamut, and for a given color model this defines a color space.  For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two different absolute color spaces, both based on the RGB color model.  When defining a color space, the usual reference standard is the CIELAB or CIEXYZ color spaces, which were specifically designed to encompass all colors the average human can see. HCL is designed to have characteristics of both cylindrical translations of RGB color space such as HSL and HSV and L*a*b* color space.  HSL and HSV color spaces have the benefit of being perceptually uniform translations of the RGB color space, but their luminance variation does not match the way humans perceive color.  Perceptually uniform translations of RGB colorspace do have the benefit of outperforming RGB in cases such as high noise environments.  L*a*b colorspace does correspond to the three channels of human perception, but have poor hue constancy, especially in the blue range."}], "output": "  The answer to your question is:\n\nInnocent Records achieved Platinum sales in the ProPhoto RGB color space.**"},

A counter-revolutionary military (made up of Cuban exiles who traveled to the United States after Castro's takeover), trained and funded by the CIA, Brigade 2506 fronted the armed wing of the Democratic Revolutionary Front (DRF) and intended to overthrow the increasingly communist government of Fidel Castro.

The name derives from the two Greek words, 'aster' (star) and 'phil' (lover), and the Latin word 'stella' meaning star.  Thus Astrophil is the star lover, and Stella is his star.  Sidney partly nativized the key features of his Italian model Petrarch, including an ongoing but partly obscure narrative, the philosophical trappings of the poet in relation to love and desire, and musings on the art of poetic creation.  Sidney also adopts the Petrarchan rhyme scheme, though he uses it with such freedom that fifteen variants are employed.

It includes contributions from the writers Alan Moore and Iain Sinclair, the torch singer Claudia Barton, and the musician Jem Finer. The Abbey Church of Waltham Holy Cross and St Lawrence is the parish church of the town of Waltham Abbey, Essex, England.  It has been a place of worship since the 7th century.  The present building dates mainly from the early 12th century and is an example of Norman architecture.  To the east of the existing church are traces of an enormous eastward enlargement of the building, begun following the re-foundation of the abbey in 1177.  In the Late Middle Ages, Waltham was one of the largest church buildings in England and a major site of pilgrimage; in 1540 was the last religious community to be closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.  It is still an active parish church for the town.Tostig Godwinson ( 1026 – 25 September 1066) was an Anglo-Saxon Earl of Northumbria and brother of King Harold Godwinson.  After being exiled by his brother, Tostig supported the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada's invasion of England, and was killed at the Battle of Stamford Bridge. Edith the Fair (Old English: Ealdgȳð Swann hnesce , Edyth the Gentle Swan; c. 1025 – c. 1086), also known as Edith Swanneck, was the first wife of King Harold Godwinson.  Swanneck (or Swan-Neck) comes from the folk etymology which made her in Old English as swann hnecca, swan neck, which was actually most likely a corrupted form of swann hnesce, Gentle Swan .  She is sometimes confused with Ealdgyth, daughter of Earl Ælfgar of Mercia, who was queen during Harold's reign. Fictional accounts based on the events surrounding Harold Godwinson's brief reign as king of England have been published, notably the play Harold, by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, in 1876; and the novel Last of the Saxon Kings, by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, in 1848.  Rudyard Kipling wrote a short story, included in his 1910 collection, Rewards and Fairies, where an aged King Harold meets Henry I and dies in the arms of a Saxon knight. The Last English King (1997) is a historical novel by English writer Julian Rathbone.  The novel covers the time of the Battle of Hastings.  It revolves around Walt Edwinson, a housecarl of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England.  The story starts with Walt returning to his home at Iwerne in Dorset four years after the Battle of Hastings.  He had fled England after the defeat of the Anglo-Saxons and had spent the time travelling across Europe and Asia Minor.  The story of his journey from Constantinople via Nicomedia and Nicaea to Side is then recounted in parallel with his recollections of the time before the battle, such as his accompanying Harold to William of Normandy's attack on Dinan."}], "output": "  The English king Harold Godwinson is buried in Essex, England.**"},

He is the twin brother of Christopher Alden, also an opera director in the revisionist mold.  The two brothers have covered much of the same repertoire in their long careers, but whereas Christopher's operatic settings place greater emphasis on his characters' emotional range, David's protagonists are more broadly caricatured and his productions far more politically charged.  Another distinguishing feature between them is that David has been more active in Europe throughout his career, having enjoyed a particularly close creative partnership with Sir Peter Jonas for more than two decades, at both the English National Opera and the Bavarian State Opera.

She won the 2010 French Open singles title, becoming the first Italian woman to win a Grand Slam event in singles.  She was also runner-up at the 2011 French Open.  Her career high ranking is world No. 4, achieved on 31 January 2011.  To date, Schiavone is the last one handed-backhand player to win a Grand Slam title on the women's tour. Olga Vasilyevna Morozova (Russian: Ольга Васильевна Морозова ) (born 22 February 1949) is a retired female tennis player who competed for the Soviet Union.  She was the runner up in singles at the 1974 French Open and 1974 Wimbledon Championships.The Williams sisters are two professional American tennis players: Venus Williams (b. 1980), a seven-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), and Serena Williams (b. 1981), twenty-three-time Grand Slam title winner (singles), both of whom were coached from an early age by their parents Richard Williams and Oracene Price.  There is a noted professional rivalry between them – between the 2001 US Open and the 2017 Australian Open tournaments, they met in nine Grand Slam singles finals.  They became the first two players, female or male, to play in 4 consecutive grand slam singles finals from the 2002 French Open to the 2003 Australian Open; Serena famously won all 4 to complete the first of two Serena Slams.  Between 2000 and 2016, a 17-year span, they collectively won 12 Wimbledon singles titles (Venus won 5 and Serena won 7).  By winning the 2001 Australian Open women's doubles title, they became the 5th pair to complete the Career Doubles Grand Slam and the only pair to complete the Career Doubles Golden Slam.  At the time, Venus and Serena were only 20 and 19 years old, respectively.  Since then they have gone on to add another two Olympic gold medals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2012 London Olympics.  Nearly a decade later, the duo would go on to win 4 consecutive grand slam doubles titles from 2009 Wimbledon through 2010 Roland Garros, which would catapult them to co-No.  1 doubles players on 7 June 2010.  Two weeks later, on 21 June 2010, Serena would hold the No. 1 singles ranking and Venus would be right behind her at No. 2 in singles.  Their most recent grand slam doubles titles came at the 2012 Wimbledon & 2016 Wimbledon events.  They remain very close, often watching each other's matches in support, even after one of them has been knocked out of a tournament. The 1968 US Open (formerly known as U.S. National Championships) was a tennis tournament that took place on the outdoor grass courts at the West Side Tennis Club, Forest Hills in New York, United States.  The tournament ran from 29 August until 8 September.  It was the 88th staging of the tournament and the fourth Grand Slam event of 1968.  It was the first edition of the tournament in the Open Era of tennis and as such for the first time offered prize money, totaling $100,000.  Arthur Ashe and Virginia Wade won the singles titles.  Ashe was still registered as an amateur and therefore not entitled to the $14,000 first-prize money, which instead went to runner-up Tom Okker, while Wade earned $6,000.  Frank Parker, at the age of 52, lost to eventual champion Arthur Ashe in the second round, and still holds the record for the oldest man to compete in a Grand Slam singles tournament. The 2012 US Open Men's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men's Singles tournament at the 2012 US Open.  In the final, Andy Murray defeated defending champion Novak Djokovic 7–6, 7–5, 2–6, 3–6, 6–2 to win the match.  It was the equal-longest US Open men's final in history, lasting 4 hours and 54 minutes (equalling the 1988 US Open final played by Ivan Lendl and Mats Wilander), and the equal second-longest men's final in the Open era, only behind the 2012 Australian Open final.  By winning the 2012 US Open, Murray became the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win a Grand Slam singles title, and the first British man in the Open Era to do so.  The match is a significant part of the rivalry between the two players.  This match also marked a milestone for Murray, as it was his 100th match win at a grand slam tournament. Li Na (; ; born 26 February 1982) is a retired Chinese professional tennis player, who achieved a career-high WTA-ranking of world No. 2 on 17 February 2014.  Over the course of her career, Li won seven WTA singles titles and two Grand Slam singles titles at the 2011 French Open and 2014 Australian Open.  Li's rise to prominence came after those victories, which made her the first and only Grand Slam singles champion from East Asia and Asia as a whole.  Prior to this, she had already become the first player representing an East Asian and Asian country to appear in a Grand Slam singles final, a milestone she achieved at the 2011 Australian Open.

He is voiced by Dan Castellaneta.  He is the long-time clown host of Bart and Lisa's favorite TV show, a combination of kiddie variety television hijinks and cartoons including The Itchy & Scratchy Show.  Krusty is often portrayed as a cynical, burnt-out, addiction-riddled smoker who is made miserable by show business but continues on anyway.  He has become one of the most common characters outside of the main Simpson family and has been the focus of several episodes, most of which also spotlight Bart. Bart the Fink is the fifteenth episode of The Simpsons<nowiki>'</nowiki> seventh season.  It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 11, 1996.  In this episode, Bart ruins Krusty the Clown's career by accidentally exposing Krusty as one of the biggest tax cheats in American history.  Driven to despair, Krusty fakes a suicide in order to start life anew as a sailor; feeling guilty for what he did, Bart convinces Krusty to become a television clown again.Rodel Flordeliz (born Rodelio Pasquito Flordeliz) is a Filipino model and TV Host.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 14, 2010.  In the episode, Homer and Marge once again try to discipline Bart after Mrs. Krabappel tells them that Bart has not been doing his homework, but Bart has a plan to manipulate Homer's strictness and Marge's sympathetic ear, which backfires when Homer and Marge see through the plan and decide to ignore Bart.  These themes had been seeded in the previous season (e.g. Double, Double, Boy in Trouble, and The Good, the Sad, and the Drugly), would culminate in the show's first ever true grounding, and the first to stand for the rest of the episode.  It would also be the last episode to feature a grounding, until The Marge-ian Chronicles in Season 27, six years later (also written by Brian Kelley). The Itchy & Scratchy Show (often shortened as Itchy & Scratchy) is a running gag and fictional animated television series featured in the American animated television series The Simpsons.  It usually appears as a part of The Krusty the Clown Show, watched regularly by Bart Simpson and Lisa Simpson.  Itself an animated cartoon, The Itchy & Scratchy Show depicts a sadistic anthropomorphic blue mouse, Itchy (voiced by Dan Castellaneta), who repeatedly maims and kills an anthropomorphic, hapless threadbare black cat, Scratchy (voiced by Harry Shearer).  The cartoon first appeared in The Tracey Ullman Show short The Bart Simpson Show, which originally aired November 20, 1988.  The cartoon's first appearance in The Simpsons was in the 1990 episode There's No Disgrace Like Home.  Typically presented as 15-to-60-second-long cartoons, the show is filled with gratuitous violence.  The Simpsons also occasionally features characters who are involved with the production of The Itchy & Scratchy Show, including Roger Meyers Jr. (voiced by Alex Rocco, and, later, Hank Azaria), who runs the studio and produces the show.

Along with its three major forks (North Fork, Middle Fork and South Fork), it comprises a major river system that drains much of northeastern Tennessee, southwestern Virginia, and northwestern North Carolina.  The Holston's confluence with the French Broad River at Knoxville marks the beginning of the Tennessee River. A longhunter (or long hunter) was an 18th-century explorer and hunter who made expeditions into the American frontier wilderness for as much as six months at a time.  Historian Emory Hamilton asserts that The Long Hunter was peculiar to Southwest Virginia only, and nowhere else on any frontier did such hunts ever originate although the term has been used loosely to describe any unofficial American explorer of the period.  Most long hunts started in the Holston River Valley near Chilhowie, Virginia.  The hunters came from there and the adjacent valley of the Clinch River, where they were land owners or residents.  The parties of two or three men (and rarely more) usually started their hunts in October and ended toward the end of March or early in April.Thái Bình river (Vietnamese: Sông Thái Bình) is the name of the Thái Bình river system's main river in Northern Vietnam.

These branches of the system contribute to or receive water from Red River.  Red River system, joining with the Thái Bình river system in the northeast, creates the Red River Delta - the second largest delta in Vietnam.  Because of the close relation between Red River system and Thái Bình river system, the two system are known as the common name Red and Thai Binh rivers system.  Alluvium of the Red River system creates the central and south Red River Delta.  Two banks of the rivers are protected by a great dyke system. The Cotter River System (CRS) is located in the Australian Capital Territory and was constructed in 1912.  A feature of the Namadgi National Park, the Cotter River System is one of two main sources for the Australian Capital Territory's water supply, the other being the Queanbeyan River located north of the Australian Capital Territory in New South Wales.

Of the major battles of the Civil War, Stones River had the highest percentage of casualties on both sides.  Although the battle itself was inconclusive, the Union Army's repulse of two Confederate attacks and the subsequent Confederate withdrawal were a much-needed boost to Union morale after the defeat at the Battle of Fredericksburg, and it dashed Confederate aspirations for control of Middle Tennessee. The Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, also known as the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on () or the Second Phase Campaign Western Sector (), was a decisive battle in the Korean War, and it took place from November 25 to December 2, 1950, along the Ch'ongch'on River Valley in the northwestern part of North Korea.  In response to the successful Chinese First Phase Campaign against the United Nations forces, General Douglas MacArthur launched the Home-by-Christmas Offensive to evict the Chinese forces from Korea and to end the war.  Anticipating this reaction, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Commander Peng Dehuai planned a counteroffensive, dubbed the Second Phase Campaign, against the advancing UN forces.The Battle of Glendale was a battle fought on the Inner Hebridean island of Skye, between the MacDonalds of Sleat and the MacDonalds of Clanranald, against the MacLeods of Harris and Dunvegan and the MacLeods of Lewis.  According to MacLeod tradition preserved in the early 19th century, the battle was fought in about the year 1490; yet it has been recently suggested that the battle more likely took place sometime after 1513.  MacLeod tradition records that the battle was the 'most tremendous battle' that the clan ever fought—although the clan was victorious, it never fully recovered from its severe losses.  MacLeod tradition relates how the MacDonalds originally had the upper hand during the conflict, but when the MacLeod's sacred Fairy Flag was unfurled the MacLeods gained heart and won the battle. The Battle of Berestechko (Polish: Bitwa pod Beresteczkiem ; Ukrainian: Берестецька битва, Битва під Берестечком ) was fought between the Ukrainian Cossacks, led by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky, aided by their Crimean Tatar allies, and a Polish army under King John II Casimir.  It was a battle of a Cossack rebellion in Ukraine that took place in the years 1648–1657 after the expiration of a two-year truce.  Fought from 28 to 30 June 1651, the battle took place in the province of Volhynia, on the hilly plain south of the Styr River.  The Polish camp was on the river opposite Berestechko and faced south, towards the Cossack army about two kilometers away, whose right flank was against the River Pliashivka (Pliashova) and the Tatar army on their left flank.  It was probably the largest European land battle of the 17th century.

It rises in Schageiuforest (Shagayu) in the West Usambara Mountains at 2,000 m altitude and flows on the north side of the mountain range to the east.  At Lelwa it empties the Mbalamu River, which comes from the extreme north of the Usambara Mountains, and the Mglumi River into the Umba.  Just before the Umba flows into the Indian Ocean, it crosses the border to Kenya.  The mouth itself marks the most eastern point on the border between Tanzania and Kenya, which was largely made in a straight line to the northwest towards Lake Victoria in the 19th Century.

Including its longest contiguous tributaries it is 2844 km long, making it the longest river system in Australia.

Cow Creek rises in the southern foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains in western Blaine County and flows east and then south, joining the Missouri approximately 25 mi northeast of Winifred, Montana—or 22 mi upstream from the Fred Robinson Bridge.  Cow Creek flows down to the Missouri in a canyon that passes through the Missouri Breaks, which are severely eroded badlands that extend out on either side from the Missouri River.  The floor of Cow Creek canyon provided a pathway of travel from the Montana plains north of the river, down to the Missouri – at the mouth of Cow Creek, Cow Island made fording the Missouri easier – a steep but short trail on the south bank of the Missouri opposite Cow Creek completed this route which led from the northern Montana plains to the central and southern Montana plains.  This pathway was used by migrating buffalo/bison and nomadic American Natives for centuries.  During the steamboat era on the Missouri River, when low water prevented riverboats getting up to Fort Benton, the mouth of Cow Creek became a river landing and freighting depot, and it was the start of the Cow Island Trail by which freight was moved on to Fort Benton by going north up Cow Creek and then west.  In 1877 the Nez Perce Indian Tribe, fleeing to Canada, had several skirmishes along Cow Creek including the Battle of Cow Island, and several days later at a camp on Cow Creek the Nez Perce, thinking themselves now beyond the reach of the U.S. Army, made the fateful decision to slow down, rather than push on for the Canada–US border.  Today, modern highways have by passed Cow Creek, and the buffalo and the nomadic Indian are gone.  Cow Creek is dormant, in one of the most remote spots of the isolated regions of the vast area known as the Montana Missouri Breaks.

The Age of Not Believing is a song written by Robert and Richard Sherman for the 1971 Walt Disney musical film production Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  Angela Lansbury sings the song in the motion picture.  In the lyrics, Lansbury's character Eglantine expresses how as children grow up, they lose their belief in magic and doubt themselves.  The song works on two levels, both on a personal, human level and thematically for the whole film- a Britain grown cynical from the pressures of war must learn to borrow from its own past magic in order to overcome the tremendous challenge which lies before it, while the characters in the film must finally learn to trust in Eglantine's magic to achieve their goals and save Britain from the Nazis.Stark Electric Jesus is a 2014 short film inspired by the poem Prochondo Boidyutik Chhutar or Stark Electric Jesus written by Malay Roy Choudhury.

Its origins go back to the Charles City-Henrico County Regiment of Militia founded in 1652.  During the French and Indian War, the Virginia Regiment was commanded by Colonel George Washington.  The regiment saw action at the Battle of Great Bridge, New York Campaign, Battle of Trenton, Battle of Princeton, Battle of Brandywine, Battle of Germantown, Battle of Monmouth, Battle of Stony Point and the Siege of Charleston.  Most of the regiment was captured at Charlestown, South Carolina, on May 12, 1780, by the British and the regiment was formally disbanded on November 15, 1783.  The 276th Engineer Battalion is the successor to the 1st Virginia Regiment. The Battle of Great Bridge was fought December 9, 1775, in the area of Great Bridge, Virginia, early in the American Revolutionary War.  The victory by colonial Virginia militia forces led to the departure of Royal Governor Lord Dunmore and any remaining vestiges of British power over the Colony of Virginia during the early days of the conflict.The 5th Virginia Regiment was raised on December 28, 1775, at Richmond, Virginia, for service with the U.S. Continental Army.

The unit was adopted into the Continental Army on May 31, 1776.  The regiment participated in the Battle of Brandywine and the Battle of Germantown.  At Germantown, under the command of Colonel George Mathews, the unit became separated from the remainder of General Nathanael Greene's division and over 400 men were taken prisoner by the British.  The regiment penetrated so deeply into the British lines that it was isolated.  Four retreating companies of the 1st British Light Infantry Battalion found themselves in the rear of the Virginians and attacked.

After being attacked on all sides and Mathews wounded, the regiment surrendered near Kelly's Hill together with part of the 6th Virginia Regiment.  The unit was consolidated with the 1st Virginia Regiment on May 12, 1779, and the consolidated unit was designated as the 1st Virginia Regiment.

The 1st Virginia State Regiment was a regiment of Virginia Militia that fought during the American Revolutionary War.  The regiment was authorized by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia in December 1776 as a force of regular troops for the Commonwealth's defense.  In 1777, Virginia had difficulty meeting its quota for the regular line of the Continental Army.  As a result, in July 1777 under the command of Colonel George Gibson, the regiment began a march North to temporarily join the Continental Army in the Philadelphia Campaign.  In January 1778, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act directing that the 1st Virginia State Regiment now in Continental service, be continued in said service instead of the Ninth Virginia Regiment, made prisoners by the enemy in the Battle of Germantown.  The regiment camped at Valley Forge in the winter of 1777-78 and at Middlebrook in the winter of 1778-79 and participated in the Battle of Monmouth.  The regiment remained in the service of the Continental Army until late 1779 when redeployed Virginia.  Unlike the standard division of eight found in the regular line regiments of the Continental Army, the 1st Virginia State Regiment consisted of ten companies including one of light infantry.

He was born in Belfast and moved to London in 1938.  Gilmore started as a trainee barman at The American Bar in 1940 and was appointed Head Barman in 1955, a position he held until he retired in 1976.  Over his years as Head Barman, Gilmore invented numerous cocktails to mark special events and important guests, a longstanding tradition at the American Bar.  Gilmore has invented cocktails in honor of a number of royalty, politicians and celebrities including The Prince of Wales, Prince William, The Princess Anne, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, The Prince Andrew, Sir Winston Churchill, and American Presidents Harry S. Truman and Richard Nixon.  He also invented cocktails to commemorate the first walk on the moon in 1969 by Neil Armstrong, and the American and Russian link-up in space in 1975. Sarah Ferguson wore a dress made from ivory duchesse satin and featuring heavy beadingfor her wedding to Prince Andrew, Duke of York on 23 July 1986 at Westminster Abbey.  Designed by Lindka Cierach, the beadwork incorporated various symbols including hearts representing romance, anchors and waves representing Prince Andrew's sailing background and bumblebees and thistles, which were taken from Sarah Ferguson's family crest.  Copies of the dress, including the motifs specific to the royal family, went on sale in stores just hours after the end of the wedding.Influenced by the wedding dress of Lady Diana Spencer, a notable feature of Sarah Ferguson's 17 foot long train was the intertwined initials A and S sewn in silver beads.  The head-dress and bouquet, fabric rosettes or artificial silk flowers were used to adorn the gown itself.  Ferguson was pleased with the dress, describing it in her 1997 memoir, My Story, as an exquisite creation I'd lost twenty-six pounds to fit into.  Lindka was a genius; I knew she could make the most flattering gown ever, and she had.  It was amazingly boned, like a corset. Hair stylist Denise McAdam and make-up artist Teresa Fairminer attended to the bride, while florist Jane Packer designed the bouquet.  The ivory silk wedding dress became the season's most sought-after style. Krajmir (; d. 15 June 1389) was a Serbian nobleman who served Prince Lazar (r. 1373–89), with the title of vojvoda (general).

One of the world's largest aquifers, it underlies an area of approximately 174000 sqmi in portions of eight states (South Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas).  It was named in 1898 by geologist N. H. Darton from its type locality near the town of Ogallala, Nebraska.  The aquifer is part of the High Plains Aquifer System, and rests on the Ogallala Formation, which is the principal geologic unit underlying 80% of the High Plains. Ogallala is a city in Keith County, Nebraska, United States.  The population was 4,737 at the 2010 census.  It is the county seat of Keith County.  In the days of the Nebraska Territory, the city was a stop on the Pony Express and later along the transcontinental railroad.  The Ogallala Aquifer was named after the city.Keystone is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in central Keith County, Nebraska, United States.  It lies along local roads near the North Platte River, northeast of the city of Ogallala, the county seat of Keith County.  Its elevation is 3,100 feet (945 m).  Although Keystone is unincorporated, it has a post office, with the ZIP code of 69144. Souris Beach Provincial Park is a day-use provincial park located near the town of Souris in eastern Prince Edward Island, Canada.  The beach is very shallow, allowing visitors to walk several hundred feet from shore on an all sand bottom.  The shallow water also results in the waters at this beach being warmer, as a result of warming by the sun, than other Island beaches where depths increase more quickly. Dune Dam is a long sand dune that lies at the western end of Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, near the confluence of the Chaco and Escavada Washs.  The dune was created by winds that brought sand up the Chaco River.  When the dune was large enough, it dammed the Chaco Wash and created a small and shallow lake near the Ancestral Puebloan great house, Penasco Blanco.  Archeological evidence suggests that the dune was breached around 900 CE.  Chacoans filled the breach with masonry sometime in the early 11th century, and built an accompanying reservoir lined with stones that was visible until 1920.  The dam stopped Chaco Wash from further deepening, which helped raise the water table in the canyon, aiding Chacoan farming.  The absence of a lacustrine plain behind the dam led geologist Stephen A. Hall to question this interpretation. Kingsley Dam is located on the east side of Lake McConaughy in central Keith County, Nebraska, and is the second largest hydraulic fill dam in the world.  It was built as part of the New Deal project.  The dam is 162 ft tall, 3.1 mi long, and 1100 ft wide at its base.  On the east side of the dam is Lake Ogallala and on the south side is the Kingsley Hydroelectricity Plant.  The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission and Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District are also located in this area.  Kingsley Dam, the Kingsley Hydroelectricity Plant, the Morning Glory Spillway, and the Outlet Tower – a large structure near the dam used to release water from the lake – are main visual icons of Lake McConaughy."}], "output": "  According to the passage, the shallow water table aquifer located near the county seat of Keith County, Nebraska is the Ogallala Aquifer.**"},

The battle occurred on November 29, 1574 when Limahong's fleet landed in the town of Parañaque and from there, began to assault the fortifications of Intramuros.  Initially, the inhabitants where disorganized and Limahong's forces routed them.  Furthermore, the Chinese killed the Master-of-Camp of the Spanish, Martin De Goiti.  This caused them to delay their assault on Manila as Martin de Goiti's house was an obstacle in their march.  However, upon the arrival of a certain Filipino hero called, Galo, resistance started to organize.  Under Galo's command, they were able to resist China-born Limahong until Mexico-born Juan de Salcedo arrived from Ilocos with 300 Ilocano Warriors and Limahong was defeated and eventually forced to retreat.  Thereafter Limahong abandoned his plans to invade Manila and instead, set up a temporary kingdom in Pangasinan."}], "output": "  Of the battles listed, the Battle of Manila occurred first, happening on February 3, 1945, followed by the Battle of Guam on July 21, 1944.

Chinese Australians are one of the largest groups of Overseas Chinese people, forming the largest Overseas Chinese community in Oceania.  Per capita, Australia has more people of Chinese ancestry than any country outside of Asia.  Many Chinese Australians are immigrants from Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and other countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines, while many are descendants of such immigrants.  Chinese Australians are also a subgroup of Asian Australians and East Asian Australians and represent the single largest minority ethnicity in the country.

Since the publication of Scouting for Boys in 1908, all Scouts and Girl Guides around the world have taken a Scout (or Guide) promise or oath to live up to ideals of the movement, and subscribed to a Scout Law.  The wording of the Scout Promise (or Oath) and Scout Law have varied slightly over time and from country to country.  Some national organization promises are given below.  Although most Scouting and Guiding organizations use the word promise, a few such as the Boy Scouts of America tend to use oath instead.  Typically, Scouts and Guides will make the three-fingered Scout Sign when reciting the promise. A small but recognizable people with Arab origins have over time settled in the India.  Genealogically they are grouped as Indo-Arabs or Indians with Arab ancestry.  Those who arrived in Kerala and Gujarat for trading goods were later recruited to the army.  Most Arabs were traders, and businessmen who sold or traded silk, diamonds and other valuables resulting in wealthy business men.  The city of Surat and villages within the city are known for Arab settlements.  Variav and Randev are the few villages that Arabs started their lives in.  In Hyderabad, Chaush are Arab community of Hadhrami descent whose ancestors were recruited as soldier by Nizam of Hyderabad.  In coastal Karnataka, Iraqis arrived during the reign of Tipu Sultan.  They claim their ancestry from Banu Assad.  These population migrations may have been favored by both the Nizam of Hyderabad and Tipu Sultan of Mysore because both had their ancestral linkages to these populations.The Asaf Jahi Dynasty claimed Arab ancestry from Asir Province and Tipu Sultan from the Bani Hashim of Hijaz Province in Arabia.  Many Arabs having Adnani ancestry such as Quraishi, Ansari, Sayyid tribes and other descendants of the Sahaba were employed by the Princely States in their military as they were found efficient during warfare.

SMI is most noted for authoring Atari's BASIC and Disk Operating System (DOS) products. The Atari Assembler Editor is a cartridge-based development system used to edit, assemble, and debug 6502 programs for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers.  It was programmed by Kathleen O'Brien of Shepardson Microsystems.  It was the first commercially available assembler for the Atari 8-bit computers.Surround is a video game programmed by Alan Miller and published by Atari, Inc. for the Atari Video Computer System (later known as the Atari 2600).  It was one of the nine Atari VCS launch titles released in September 1977.  Surround is an unofficial port of the arcade game Blockade, released the previous year by Gremlin.  As such, it is the first home console version of the game that would become widely known across many platforms as Snake.  As with other early Atari games, it was licensed to Sears, which released it under the name Chase. The Atari XE Video Game System (Atari XEGS) is a home video game console released by Atari Corporation in 1987.  Based on Atari's 8-bit 65XE computer, the XEGS is compatible with the existing Atari 8-bit computer software library.  Additionally, it is able to operate as either a stand-alone console or full computer with the addition of its specially designed keyboard.  In computer mode, it may utilize the majority of peripherals released for Atari's 8-bit computer line.  Atari packaged the XEGS as a basic set consisting of only the console and joystick, and as a deluxe set consisting of the console, keyboard, joystick and light gun. The HP 64000, introduced circa 1980, is a tool for developing hardware and software for products based on commercial microcomputers.  The earliest commercial 64000 development systems contain from one to six 64100A Development Stations sharing a hard drive and line printer.  This arrangement allowed up to six designers and engineers to use their workstations together, sharing the HPIB instrumentation bus and a hard drive and a line printer.  This was an innovative feature of the 64000 development system since other systems of the era used a timesharing system with a single system processor and memory, making for a more expensive and less flexible development system. Star Ship is a video game programmed by Bob Whitehead and published by Atari, Inc. for its Video Computer System (later known as the Atari 2600).

In 1991, the band embraced a black metal style influenced by Bathory and Celtic Frost and became one of the leading bands in the Norwegian black metal scene.  Their first three black metal albums—A Blaze in the Northern Sky, Under a Funeral Moon and Transilvanian Hunger (sometimes dubbed the Unholy Trinity) — are considered the peak of the band's career and to be among the most influential albums in the genre.  For most of this time, Darkthrone has been a duo of Nocturno Culto and Fenriz, who have sought to remain outside the music mainstream.  Since 2006, their work has strayed from the traditional black metal style and incorporated more elements of traditional heavy metal, speed metal and punk rock, being likened to Motörhead.I Hate Myself (for Loving You) is the ninth album by Thijs van Leer, released under the name Van Leer.

Written by Nancy Mitford and first published in 1957, the book also explores the French Enlightenment. Gabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise Du Châtelet (] ; 17 December 1706  – 10 September 1749) was a French natural philosopher, mathematician, physicist, and author during the early 1730s until her untimely death due to childbirth in 1749.  Her most recognized achievement is her translation of and commentary on Isaac Newton's book Principia containing basic laws of physics.  The translation, published posthumously in 1759, is still considered the standard French translation today.  Her commentary includes a profound contribution to Newtonian mechanics—the postulate of an additional conservation law for total energy, of which kinetic energy of motion is one element.Katherine Kath (11 August 1920 – 17 November 2012) was a French prima ballerina at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, who became an actress after suffering from an injury which destroyed her chances of continuing her career.

The Ethiopian Legal Information Website is an online database of laws in Ethiopia.  It aims to provide the public, researchers, professors, law firms and legal professionals access to the basic laws on the web and other digital formats.  It was developed by Mekelle University Law Faculty in Ethiopia in cooperation with the Non-Western Law Department of Ghent University in Belgium.  While it contains only the laws of the federal government at this moment, it plans adding state, regional and other laws. The principal laws of association are contiguity, repetition, attention, pleasure-pain, and similarity.  The basic laws were formulated by Aristotle in approximately 300 B.C. and by John Locke in the seventeenth century.  Both philosophers taught that the mind at birth is a blank slate and that all knowledge has to be acquired by learning.  The laws they taught still make up the backbone of modern learning theory. Jean du Chatelet, also known as Baron de Beausoleil and Auffembach (1578, Brabant – c. 1645, The Bastille, Paris), was a mineralogist, mining engineer and dowser."}], "output": "  Emilie du Chatelet made a significant contribution to the basic laws of physics through her translation and commentary on Isaac Newton's book \"Principia\". In her work, she added a postulate that Newton had overlooked, which is now considered a fundamental law of physics: the conservation of total energy, which includes both kinetic energy and potential energy. This postulate is still widely accepted and used in modern physics today. *"},

He resigned as mayor in September 2008 after being convicted of perjury and obstruction of justice.  Kilpatrick was sentenced to four months in jail and was released on probation after serving 99 days. The Detroit mayoral elections of 2009 took place on May 5, 2009, with a primary on February 24, 2009 to fill the vacancy created when Kwame Kilpatrick resigned as mayor.Jane Marum Roush (born September 24, 1956) is a Virginia lawyer and Judge who served as an interim Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia.  On July 27, 2015, Governor Terry McAuliffe announced his appointment of Roush to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice LeRoy F. Millette, Jr. effective July 31, 2015.  Under the Constitution of Virginia, this original interim appointment was to expire thirty days after the commencement of the next session of the Virginia General Assembly, unless the legislature elected her to a full twelve-year term.  On August 17, 2015, the General Assembly convened in special session but failed to elect anyone to the full twelve-year term before the Senate of Virginia purported to adjourn sine die.  The Constitution prohibits one chamber of the legislature from adjourning for more than three days without the consent of the other chamber.  The Governor claims that this provision applies only to regular sessions of the General Assembly; the House of Delegates and most Senate Republicans claim it applies to special sessions as well, and that the Senate's adjournment was invalid because the House did not consent.  Because there is legal uncertainty about whether the legislature was still in session, it is unclear whether the governor could fill the vacancy created when Justice Roush's original interim appointment expired on September 16, 2015.  Nevertheless, the governor announced his view that the legislature was not in session and purported to reappoint her for a second interim term.  Whether this second interim appointment was valid or invalid has not been determined.  If valid, the second interim appointment expired on February 12, 2016, thirty days after the regular session of the General Assembly began on January 13, because the legislature did not elect her to a full twelve-year term. This is a list of municipal elections held in the city of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.  Elections for mayor were held annually until the 1923 election, when the election was for a two-year term.  From the 1971 election, the mayoral term was three years.  Elections for councillors and aldermen were held annually until the 1914 election, when the terms switched to two-year overlapping terms, with half of each council up for election each year.  From the 1971 election, the aldermanic elections lined up fully with the mayoral elections, and were also for three-year terms.  In 1976, the number of wards expanded to 14 (current number) with one alderman representing each ward for three years.  On December 14, 2010, council voted to change the title to councillor, which took effect in the October 2013 election.  In 2012 the Local Authorities Election Act was amended to increase the term length of the mayor and councillors to 4 years. Joseph F.

For twenty years, INXS was fronted by Hutchence, whose sultry good looks and magnetic stage presence made him the focal point of the band.  Initially known for their new wave/pop style, the band later developed a harder pub rock style that included funk and dance elements.Bitið fast í vitið (roughly Bite Hard In Your Mind in Icelandic) is the début EP of Icelander punk/pop group Tappi Tíkarrass .  It was released in late-1982 on the Spor label, within a year of the band's formation in September 1981 – led by vocalists Björk and Eyþór Arnalds .  This was the band's most punk-oriented release and contains five tracks, featuring one in English, London. Steeltown were an Australian band based in the city of Brisbane who performed in the 90s a genre of synth, rock, pop and produced their greatest top forty chart hit with the song 'Hero' which was released in September 1991.

It is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which is a major target for drugs that raises blood pressure.  Angiotensin also stimulates the release of aldosterone, another hormone, from the adrenal cortex.  Aldosterone promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron, in the kidney, which also drives blood pressure up. Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid hormone, is a steroid hormone produced by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in the adrenal gland.  It is essential for sodium conservation in the kidney, salivary glands, sweat glands and colon.  It plays a central role in the regulation of the plasma sodium (Na), the extracellular potassium (K) and arterial blood pressure.  It does so mainly by acting on the mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron.  It influences the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium (from and into the tubular fluids, respectively) of the kidney, thereby indirectly influencing water retention or loss, blood pressure and blood volume.  When dysregulated, aldosterone is pathogenic and contributes to the development and progression of cardiovascular and renal disease.  Aldosterone has exactly the opposite function of the atrial natriuretic hormone secreted by the heart.The sodium-chloride symporter (also known as Na-Cl cotransporter, abbreviated as NCC or NCCT, or as the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter or TSC for short) is a cotransporter in the kidney which has the function of reabsorbing sodium and chloride ions from the tubular fluid into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron.  It is a member of the SLC12 cotransporter family of electroneutral cation-coupled chloride cotransporters.  In humans, it is encoded by the gene SLC12A3 (solute carrier family 12 member 3) located in 16q13. In the kidney, the loop of Henle ( ) (or Henle's loop, Henle loop, nephron loop or its Latin counterpart ansa nephroni) is the portion of a nephron that leads from the proximal convoluted tubule to the distal convoluted tubule.  Named after its discoverer, the German anatomist Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle, the loop of Henle's main function is to create a concentration gradient in the medulla of the kidney. Low pressure receptors are baroreceptors located in the venae cavae and the pulmonary arteries, and in the atria.  They are also called volume receptors.  These receptors respond to changes in the wall tension, which is proportional to the filling state of the low pressure side of circulation (below 60mmHg).  Their impulses regulate the secretion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH/Vasopressin), renin and aldosterone.  An elevated atrial pressure produces a decrease in ADH and aldosterone secretion.  The decrease in vasopressin secretion results in an increase in the volume of urine excreted, serving to lower blood pressure.  In addition, stretching of atrial receptors increases secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which promotes increased water and sodium excretion through the urine. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a medical condition that involves an accumulation of acid in the body due to a failure of the kidneys to appropriately acidify the urine.  In renal physiology, when blood is filtered by the kidney, the filtrate passes through the tubules of the nephron, allowing for exchange of salts, acid equivalents, and other solutes before it drains into the bladder as urine.  The metabolic acidosis that results from RTA may be caused either by failure to reabsorb sufficient bicarbonate ions (which are alkaline) from the filtrate in the early portion of the nephron (the proximal tubule) or by insufficient secretion of hydrogen ions (which are acidic) into the latter portions of the nephron (the distal tubule).  Although a metabolic acidosis also occurs in those with renal insufficiency, the term RTA is reserved for individuals with poor urinary acidification in otherwise well-functioning kidneys.  Several different types of RTA exist, which all have different syndromes and different causes."}], "output": "  Aldosterone produces sodium retention in the distal nephron.**"},

Midterm elections in the United States refer to general elections in the United States that are held two years after the quadrennial (four-year) elections for the President of the United States (i.e. near the midpoint of the four-year presidential term).  Federal offices that are up for election during the midterms are members of the United States Congress, including all 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives, and the full terms for 33 or 34 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate. The three classes of United States Senators are made up of 33 or 34 Senate seats each.  The purpose of the classes is to determine which Senate seats will be up for election in a given year.  The three groups are staggered so that one of them is up for election every two years, rather than having all 100 seats up for election at once.  For example, the 33 Senate seats of Class 1 were elected in 2012, the 33 seats of Class 2 were up for election in 2014, and the 34 seats of Class 3 were up for election in 2016.

Jones, (Fla. 1973), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of Florida that was the first adoption of the comparative negligence rule in negligence law through judicial decision as opposed to adoption through statute.  In the wrongful death case of Hoffman v. Jones, attorney Sammy Cacciatore Jr. was instrumental in causing the Florida Supreme Court to adopt for the first time the comparative negligence rule in negligence law.William Harrison Jones Jr. was killed by a Pav-A-Way Corporation truck driven by Philip Francis Hoffman Jr.  It was the first case in the nation in which a state supreme court abandoned the almost-150-year-old doctrine of contributory negligence, which precluded an injured victim from recovery if the victim had contributed to the incident to any degree.  The Florida Supreme Court adopted the concept of “pure” comparative negligence, which allows a victim to be compensated for the percentage of harm caused by the at-fault person.  The decision of the court in Hoffman v. Jones has been cited in law school textbooks, and now the concept of comparative negligence is the prevailing doctrine. Van Staphorst v.

United States, 320 U.S. 81 (1943), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that the application of curfews against members of a minority group were constitutional when the nation was at war with the country from which that group originated.

She is married to saxophonist Jim Tomlinson. The Boy Next Door is a 2003 album by jazz singer Stacey Kent.  The songs were chosen to reflect male singers that Kent admires.Hold Me in Your Arms is the second album by the British pop singer Rick Astley, released in November 1988 on RCA Records serving as the follow-up to his debut album Whenever You Need Somebody.  Like his previous albums, half the record was written and produced by Stock Aitken & Waterman, and the other half were Astley's own compositions produced by PWL associates Phil Harding, Ian Curnow and Daize Washbourn.  The release of the album was delayed a few months due to a fire at PWL Studios destroying some of Astley's recorded material.  This would be Astley's last record with Stock, Aitken & Waterman, due to Astley wanting to leave behind the dance-pop sound of the producers, of wanting to shed his boy next door image, and wanting to focus on his original compositions on his albums, reappearing in 1991 with the soul album Free. Boy Next Door is the fifth single from British R&B artist Jamelia and the fourth and final single from her debut album Drama.  Boy Next Door is Jamelia's smallest hit, missing the UK Top 40, peaking at #42 and spending only two weeks inside the Top 75.  The version released as a single was a slight remix to the version that appears on the album and is also slightly shorter in length. Not the Boy Next Door is a studio album released in 1983 by Australian singer and songwriter Peter Allen.  This was his first release under Arista Records. The boy next door is an archetype of storytelling.  He is often invoked in Western contexts to indicate wholesome, unassuming, or average masculinity.  A boy next door may serve as a love interest for a female protagonist who lives near by."}], "output": "  Stacey Kent.**"},

The battalion was disbanded in 1919, however was re-raised in 1921 as part of the Citizens Force, serving as a part-time unit in Tasmania throughout the inter-war years.  During the Second World War, the 40th remained in Australia until it was amalgamated with the 12th Battalion.  It was disbanded in 1946, but was later re-raised in the 1950s before being subsumed into the Royal Tasmania Regiment in 1960.

Prior to this he served eight months as the 40th Vice President of the United States, following the resignation of Spiro Agnew.  He was the first person appointed to the vice presidency under the terms of the 25th Amendment, and consequently the only person to have served as both Vice President and President of the United States without being elected to executive office.  Before his appointment to the vice presidency, Ford served 25 years as U.S. Representative from Michigan's 5th congressional district, the final nine of them as the House Minority Leader.

After delivering a stirring speech in support of Barry Goldwater's presidential candidacy in 1964, he was persuaded to seek the California governorship, winning two years later and again in 1970.  In 1980 as the Republican candidate for president of the United States, he defeated incumbent Jimmy Carter.  He was reelected in a landslide in 1984, proclaiming that it was Morning in America.

Kyokusui-no-en (曲水の宴 (Winding stream party ) ) is a modern Japanese ceremony replicating a historical party game played by the nobility.  Participants must compose a tanka poem beside a stream, within a time limit set by the passage of a lacquer cup of sake floating towards them on the water.  When the cup reached the poet, they were expected to drink its contents, either as a celebration of the poem's completion or as a forfeit if they had not composed a suitable verse in time.  The first kyokusui-no-en events were reportedly held in the Kofun period during the reign of Emperor Kenzō, making the ceremony around 1,500 years old.  Other sources, however, suggest that the game originated in the Heian period, around 500 years later; it appears in scrolls from that period and is mentioned in The Pillow Book of Sei Shōnagon.

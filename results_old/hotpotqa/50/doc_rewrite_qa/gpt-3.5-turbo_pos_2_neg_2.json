The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers.  The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism.  It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation.  Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive. Front Row is a discontinued media center software application for Apple's Macintosh computers and Apple TV for navigating and viewing video, photos, podcasts, and music from a computer, optical disc, or the Internet through a 10-foot user interface (similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi).  The software relies on iTunes and iPhoto and is controlled by an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys.  The first version was released October 2005, with two major revisions since.  Front Row was removed and discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7.A universal remote is a remote control that can be programmed to operate various brands of one or more types of consumer electronics devices.  Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.  Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.  For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions. In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.  For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.  A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.  In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level."}], "output": "Universal remote.**"},

Its general ideology was revolutionary socialism of democratic socialist and agrarian socialist forms.  After the February Revolution of 1917, it shared power with other liberal and democratic socialist forces within the Russian Provisional Government.  In November 1917, it won a plurality of the national vote in Russia's first-ever democratic elections (to the Russian Constituent Assembly), but the October Revolution had changed the political landscape and the Bolsheviks disbanded the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.  The SRs soon split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions.  The anti-Bolshevik faction of this party, known as the Right SRs, which remained loyal to the Provisional Government leader Alexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of the Russian Civil War and subsequent persecution. The Russian Civil War (Russian: Гражда́нская война́ в Росси́и , Grazhdanskaya voyna v Rossiyi ; November 1917 – October 1922) was a multi-party war in the former Russian Empire immediately after the Russian Revolutions of 1917, as many factions vied to determine Russia's political future.  The two largest combatant groups were the Red Army, fighting for the Bolshevik form of socialism led by Vladimir Lenin, and the loosely allied forces known as the White Army, which included diverse interests favoring monarchism, capitalism and alternative forms of socialism, each with democratic and antidemocratic variants.  In addition, rival militant socialists and nonideological Green armies fought against both the Bolsheviks and the Whites.  Eight foreign nations intervened against the Red Army, notably the Allied Forces and the pro-German armies.  The Red Army defeated the White Armed Forces of South Russia in Ukraine and the army led by Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak in Siberia in 1919.  The remains of the White forces commanded by Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel were beaten in Crimea and evacuated in late 1920.  Lesser battles of the war continued on the periphery for two more years, and minor skirmishes with the remnants of the White forces in the Far East continued well into 1923.  The war ended in 1923 in the sense that Red control of the newly formed Soviet Union was now assured, although armed national resistance in Central Asia was not completely crushed until 1934.  There were an estimated 7,000,000–12,000,000 casualties during the war, mostly civilians.  The Russian Civil War has been described by some as the greatest national catastrophe that Europe had yet seen.Communism in Russia began after Tsar Nicholas II lost his power during the February Revolution.  The Provisional Government was established under Prince Lvov, however, the Bolsheviks refused to accept the government and revolted in October 1917, taking control of Russia.  Vladmir Lenin, their leader, rose to power and governed between 1917 and 1924.  The Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, marking the beginning of the Russian Civil War between the revolutionary Reds and the counter-revolutionary Whites.  In 1922 the Communist Reds were victorious, and formed the Soviet Union.  Lenin died in 1924, starting a power struggle which ended with Joseph Stalin seizing power.  He was the leader of the Communist Party until 1953.  He encouraged political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove opponents of his dominance. Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov (Russian: Лавр Гео́ргиевич Корни́лов , ] ; 18 August 1870 – 13 April 1918) was a military intelligence officer, explorer, and general in the Imperial Russian Army during World War I and the ensuing Russian Civil War.  He is today best remembered for the Kornilov Affair, an unsuccessful endeavor in August/September 1917 that purported to strengthen Alexander Kerensky's Provisional Government, but which led to Kerensky eventually having Kornilov arrested and charged with attempting a coup d'état, and ultimately undermined the rule of Kerensky; strengthening the claims and power of the soviets, and the Bolshevik party."}], "output": "The Russian Civil War ended in October 1922.**"},

The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.  The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters.The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized American hunting terrier.  Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times. A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants.  These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier.  These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.  Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier."}], "output": "The Manchester Terrier's ancestors include Gordon and Irish Setters. **"},

This climactic battle of the First Italo-Ethiopian War, was a decisive defeat for Italy and secured Ethiopian sovereignty. Giuseppe Edoardo Arimondi, OSML, OMS, OCI (Savigliano, 26 April 1846 – Adwa, 1 March 1896) was an Italian general, mostly known for his role during the First Italo-Ethiopian War.  He was one of the few European commanders who gained a victory over the Mahdists before Kitchener's Expedition, soundly defeating them at Agordat in 1893.  After a long and successfull colonial service, he died in combat at Adwa, and was posthumously awarded the Gold Medal of Military Valor.The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896.  It originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned the country into an Italian protectorate.  Italy was supported by the two other triple alliance members Germany and Austria.  Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than being opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected.  In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia, an Orthodox Christian nation like Ethiopia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons for Ethiopian forces during the war.  Ethiopia was also supported diplomatically by the United Kingdom and France in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.  Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender.  Italian defeat came about after the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive blow and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. Ethiopia–Japan relations are the international relations between Ethiopia and Japan.  Both were nations with an ancient history which successfully repulsed European military advances to dominate them, Ethiopia at the Battle of Adwa, and Japan at the Battle of Tsushima, and as a result both nations considered each other potential allies prior to World War II."}], "output": "The Battle of Adwa secured Ethiopian sovereignty.**"},

The first track, To Know Him Is to Love Him, released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears.  Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, The First Tycoon of Teen.  The package also contained a small, round, red Back to Mono pin. To Know Him Is to Love Him is a song written by Phil Spector, inspired by words on his father's tombstone, To Know Him Was To Love Him.  It was first recorded by the only vocal group of which he was a member, the Teddy Bears.  Their recording spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in 1958, while reaching No. 2 on UK's New Musical Express chart.  Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton later had hits with the song, with its title and lyrics changed to To Know You Is to Love You.  In 1987, the song was resurrected by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris, whose Trio recording topped the U.S. country singles charts.  The song is in 12/8 time.Trash Box is a 5-CD box set of mid-1960s garage rock and psychedelic rock recordings, primarily by American bands.  This box set is similar to the earlier Pebbles Box (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc.  Supposedly, the Trash Box collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on Pebbles, Volume 4 have been eschewed entirely.  Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the Pebbles Box.  Although most of the recordings on the Trash Box were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series.  Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit I Fought the Law (but the Law Won) by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) – which is also included in the Pebbles Box – in place of the much rarer Wine Wine Wine by Bobby Fuller that appears on Pebbles, Volume 2. Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003.  At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format.  This box set, and the companion release Rancho Texicano, were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from ZZ Top's First Album, Rio Grande Mud, and Tejas, aside from 1977's The Best of ZZ Top which features two tracks from Rio Grande Mud and one track from First Album.  Tres Hombres and Fandango!  were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes."}], "output": "The writer of the song \"To Know Him Is to Love Him,\" which was inspired by words on a tombstone and was the first track on the box set Back to Mono, is Phil Spector.**"},

He graduated in the 1920s from a local vocational school, and again in the mid-to-late 1930s from the Rybinsk Aviation Technology Institute.  He became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1930.  As many like him, Kirilenko climbed up the Soviet hierarchy through the industrial ladder; by the 1960s, he was Vice-Chairman of the Bureau of the Central Committee of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR).  After Nikita Khrushchev's forced resignation, Kirilenko became Leonid Brezhnev's chief lieutenant within the Central Committee."}], "output": "The World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates.**"},

From its formation in 1916 as part of the Australian Flying Corps, it has flown a variety of aircraft types including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C).  During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions.  It was disbanded in mid-1919, following the end of hostilities.  The squadron was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF, but was disbanded after only a couple of months and not reformed until 1937.  It saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II and, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets, in the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War.  The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra.  It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C Wedgetail.  One of the six Boeing 737s was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS. The English Electric Canberra is a British first-generation jet-powered medium bomber that was manufactured during the 1950s.  It was developed by English Electric during the mid-to-late 1940s in response to a 1944 Air Ministry requirement for a successor to the wartime de Havilland Mosquito fast-bomber.  Amongst the performance requirements for the type was the demand for an outstanding high altitude bombing capability in addition to flying at high speeds.  These were partly accomplished by making use of newly developed jet propulsion technology.  When the Canberra was introduced to service with the Royal Air Force (RAF), the type's first operator, in May 1951, it became the service's first jet-powered bomber aircraft.The South West Pacific theatre, during World War II, was a major theatre of the war between the Allies and Japan.  It included the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (except for Sumatra), Borneo, Australia and its mandate Territory of New Guinea (including the Bismarck Archipelago) and the western part of the Solomon Islands.  This area was defined by the Allied powers' South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command. The Asiatic-Pacific Theater, was the theater of operations of U.S. forces during World War II in the Pacific War during 1941-45.  From mid-1942 until the end of the war in 1945, there were two U.S. operational commands in the Pacific.  The Pacific Ocean Areas (POA), divided into the Central Pacific Area, the North Pacific Area and the South Pacific Area, were commanded by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief Pacific Ocean Areas.  The South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was commanded by General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied Commander South West Pacific Area.

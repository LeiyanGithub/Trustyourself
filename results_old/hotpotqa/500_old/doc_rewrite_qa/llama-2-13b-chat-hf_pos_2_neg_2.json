The remote was originally designed to control the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5, and it's compatible with some later Mac computers. The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote to control the device. However, the latest fourth generation of Apple TV uses a different remote called the Siri Remote. Before the Apple Remote, Apple made other remote controls for products like the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive, but these were not named. Front Row was a software program that let you watch videos, look at photos, listen to music, and listen to podcasts on your Mac computer or Apple TV. It had a user-friendly interface that made it easy to use, kind of like Windows Media Center and Kodi. Front Row used iTunes and iPhoto to play all your media, and you could control it with an Apple Remote or your keyboard. The first version came out in 2005, and there were two updates before it was discontinued in 2011.A universal remote is a special type of remote control that can be programmed to work with many different brands of consumer electronics devices. Some low-end universal remotes can only control a limited number of devices, but mid- and high-end remotes allow you to add new devices by programming in their control codes. Many remotes that come with specific devices, like a VCR remote, can also be programmed to control other types of devices, like TVs. So, you can use one remote to control many different devices, instead of having to use separate remotes for each one. In electronics, a remote control is a tool that lets you operate a device from a distance. For example, you can use a remote control to turn on your TV, DVD player, or other household appliances without having to get up from your couch. This is especially useful when the device is too far away to reach or when you need to operate it from a different room. Some remote controls can even let you do things like open your garage door or control a projector that's mounted high up on the ceiling."}], "output": "  Sure!

The two main groups were the Red Army, led by Vladimir Lenin, and the White Army, which included people who wanted a monarchy, capitalism, or other types of government. Other groups, like militant socialists and non-ideological armies, also fought against both the Red Army and the Whites. Eight other countries, like the Allied Forces and Germany, helped fight against the Red Army.\n\nThe Red Army won most of the battles, and the White Army lost. The last of the White forces were defeated in Crimea in 1920, and some fighting continued in the Far East until 1923. The war caused a lot of damage and killed an estimated 7 to 12 million people, mostly civilians. Some people call it the greatest national disaster Europe had ever seen.After the Tsar lost power in Russia during the February Revolution, a new government called the Provisional Government was formed. However, a group called the Bolsheviks, led by Vladmir Lenin, didn't agree with this government and took control of Russia in October 1917. Lenin ruled Russia from 1917 to 1924 and formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. This led to a big fight between the revolutionary Reds (the Bolsheviks) and the people who wanted to go back to the old way of doing things (Whites). The Reds won in 1922 and formed the Soviet Union. When Lenin died in 1924, there was a fight for power, and Joseph Stalin became the leader of the Communist Party. He was in charge until 1953 and had a lot of people killed or sent to prison if they opposed him. Lavr Kornilov was a military officer and explorer who served in the Russian Army during World War I and the Russian Civil War. He is known for the Kornilov Affair, which was an attempt to support the government of Alexander Kerensky, but instead led to Kerensky having Kornilov arrested and charged with trying to overthrow him. This event weakened Kerensky's rule and strengthened the power of the soviets and the Bolshevik party."}], "output": "  Sure! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nAlexander Kerensky was defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the course of a civil war that ended in 1922.**"},

It's a part of the terrier group, which means it's a small dog that's great at hunting and playing. The Scotch Collie is a type of dog that originated in the highlands of Scotland. It comes in two different types: the long-haired one, now called the Rough Collie, and the short-haired one, now called the Smooth Collie. This breed is thought to have come from a variety of old herding dogs, some of which date back to when the Romans were in Scotland. These dogs might have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Celtic Dogs, and Viking Herding Spitzes. Other ancestors of the Scotch Collie were the Gordon and Irish Setters.The Teddy Roosevelt Terrier is a small to medium-sized dog that originated in America. It's a hunting terrier with a muscular build and strong bones. The breed has a diverse history and is related to other terrier breeds like the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terrier. These dogs were brought to America by early English and other working-class immigrants, and they were bred for their work ethic and ability to hunt. The breed is thought to have ancestry from dogs like the Feist, Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, and the now-extinct English White Terrier. These early ratting terriers were bred with Beagles and other dogs to create the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier. This breed is intelligent, aware of its surroundings, and has a strong sense of smell. They are loyal companions who enjoy being near their owners and pleasing them. A Feist is a small hunting dog that originated from terriers brought to the United States by English miners and other working-class immigrants. These terriers were likely mixed with other breeds like the Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, and the now-extinct English White Terrier. They were used for hunting and killing rats, and their owners would often gamble on their performance. To create a more versatile breed, some Feists have been crossed with other breeds like Whippets, Italian Greyhounds, and Beagles. This has expanded the Feist family and given them a wider range of skills beyond just hunting rats."}], "output": "  **The Manchester Terrier.** The passage states that the Scotch Collie's ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters, but the Manchester Terrier is not mentioned as having any of these breeds as ancestors."},

It happened near the town of Adwa in Tigray, Ethiopia, and was a key battle in the First Italo-Ethiopian War. The battle was a big win for Ethiopia, and it helped to keep Ethiopia independent and in control of its own country. Giuseppe Edoardo Arimondi was an Italian general who played a significant role in the First Italo-Ethiopian War.

He was given a special award for his bravery, the Gold Medal of Military Valor, after his death.The First Italo-Ethiopian War was a conflict between Italy and Ethiopia that lasted from 1895 to 1896. The war started because the Italians said they had a special agreement with Ethiopia that made the country an Italian protectorate, but the Ethiopians didn't agree with this. The Italians had some friends, like Germany and Austria, who supported them in the war. However, the Ethiopians had some friends too, like Russia and the United Kingdom, who helped them fight against the Italians. The war started in 1893 when the Italians invaded Ethiopia from a place called Eritrea, but the Ethiopians were able to fight back and defeat the Italians. The war ended with a big battle called the Battle of Adwa, where the Ethiopians defeated the Italians and made them retreat back to Eritrea. Ethiopia and Japan have a long history of interactions, and they share a common bond in that they both successfully resisted European military attempts to control them. In the late 19th century, Ethiopia defeated European forces at the Battle of Adwa, while Japan fought off European powers at the Battle of Tsushima in the early 20th century.

The squadron has been around since 1916 and has flown many different types of planes, including fighters, bombers, and Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C). During World War I, the squadron flew missions on the Western Front, attacking enemy planes and ground targets. After the war ended, the squadron was disbanded, but was later re-formed in 1937. During World War II, the squadron flew bombing missions in the South West Pacific and later in the Malayan Emergency and Vietnam War. In 1982, the squadron was disbanded again, but was re-formed in 2000 to fly the Boeing 737 AEW&C plane. In 2014, one of the squadron's planes was sent to the Middle East to help fight against ISIS as part of Australia's military contribution. The English Electric Canberra is a British plane that was made in the 1950s. It was designed to be a medium bomber that could fly fast and high. The plane was developed in the mid-to-late 1940s to replace the de Havilland Mosquito, which was a fast bomber used during World War II. The people who made the Canberra wanted it to be able to fly high and drop bombs accurately, so they used new jet engine technology. When the Canberra was introduced to the Royal Air Force (RAF) in May 1951, it became the first jet-powered bomber plane used by the RAF.During World War II, the South West Pacific was a key battleground between the Allies and Japan. This region included the Philippines, Indonesia (except for Sumatra), Borneo, Australia, and parts of New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The Allies referred to this area as the South West Pacific Area (SWPA) and it was a major focus of the war. During World War II, the Asiatic-Pacific Theater was where American forces fought against the enemy in the Pacific region. From mid-1942 to the end of the war in 1945, there were two main commands in the Pacific: the Pacific Ocean Areas (POA) and the South West Pacific Area (SWPA). Admiral Chester W. Nimitz led the POA, which was divided into three areas: Central Pacific, North Pacific, and South Pacific. General Douglas MacArthur led the SWPA.

If they are found to be genuine refugees, they will be sent to Papua New Guinea (PNG) to be resettled, rather than being allowed to stay in Australia. The policy includes building a bigger detention center on Manus Island in PNG where refugees will be held while their status is checked. If they are not found to be genuine refugees, they will be sent back to their home country, sent to a different country, or kept in detention forever. The policy was introduced on July 19, 2013, by the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and the Prime Minister of PNG, Peter O'Neill, because there were too many asylum seekers coming to Australia by boat.

They drafted Alonzo Mourning from Georgetown with the second overall pick. With Mourning, Larry Johnson, and Muggsy Bogues on the team, the Hornets had a good season and finished with a record of 44-38, good enough for third in the Central Division. This was the first time the team made the playoffs, and they even won their first playoff series against the Boston Celtics in dramatic fashion when Mourning made a game-winning jump shot at the buzzer.

Instead of using traditional themes, Goldsmith created a spooky and unsettling soundtrack that matches the dark and intense mood of the film. The music is dissonant and doesn't have any happy or romantic parts, which adds to the overall feeling of fear and unease.

In the 1960s, he performed and recorded under the names Bob Seger and the Last Heard and Bob Seger System in the Detroit area. He later dropped System from his recordings and continued to seek success with different bands. In 1973, he formed the Silver Bullet Band with musicians from the Detroit area, and they achieved national success with the album Live Bullet in 1976, recorded live at Cobo Hall in Detroit. That same year, Seger's studio album Night Moves brought him a national breakout. He also worked with the Alabama-based Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section, which appeared on many of his best-selling singles and albums. Bob Seger's album Against the Wind was his eleventh album and his fourth with the Silver Bullet Band. It was released in February 1980 and became his only number one album to date, staying at the top of the Billboard Top LPs chart for six weeks. This was a big achievement, as it knocked Pink Floyd's The Wall off the top spot!Bob Seger's album Ride Out is his 17th studio album, and it was released in October 2014.

Goldberg held that the practice of what way of filling armed forces vacancies was consitutional? \n\n Passage: In 1981, the US Supreme Court ruled that it was constitutional for the government to only require men to register for the draft. This was because the law had been passed by Congress and applied only to men. Some lawyers, including Robert L. Goldberg, argued that this was unfair and violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution. The Supreme Court disagreed, ruling that the law was constitutional and that only men would be required to register for the draft. The case was called Rostker v. Goldberg and the decision was 6-3 in favor of the government. The United States government has used conscription, also known as the draft, in four wars: the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including the Korean and Vietnam Wars). In 1940, the government started the draft to fill empty spots in the military during peacetime and times of conflict. Men were required to join the military whether they wanted to or not. The draft ended in 1973 when the military switched to an all-volunteer force. However, the system is still in place in case the government needs to bring back the draft in the future. All men between 18 and 25 are required to register for the draft.In 2010, a big parade was held in Kiev to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory in a big war. The parade was led by the Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces, Ivan Svyda. The head of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Colonel General Gennady Vorobyov, was in charge of the parade. The President of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, gave a special speech. Over 2,500 soldiers from Russia and Belarus took part in the parade, and there were 17 military bands that played music under the direction of Major General Volodymyr Derkach. The Indian armed forces and veterans have been demanding One Rank One Pension (OROP) for a long time. This means that soldiers with the same rank and length of service should receive the same pension, regardless of when they retired. The demand for equal pensions is based on the idea that soldiers who served the country should be treated fairly and not have their pensions reduced without a good reason. In 1973, the government led by Indira Gandhi, who was the Prime Minister of India, made a decision that affected the pensions of soldiers. The decision was made without consulting the armed forces, and it reduced the pensions of soldiers by 20-40% while increasing the pensions of civilians by 20%. This decision was unfair and has been a source of controversy for many years."}], "output": "  Sure! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nRostker v.

This idea is not supported by most scientists, including the Royal Society and over 50 other scientific organizations around the world. Despite this, Truth in Science claims that there is a scientific debate about the validity of evolution, which is not actually the case. The group is closely tied to the Discovery Institute, a organization that promotes intelligent design, and uses their materials to make their case. The Discovery Institute (DI) is a conservative organization based in Seattle, Washington, that advocates for the idea of intelligent design (ID) being taught in public high school science classes. They believe that there is a controversy between ID and accepted scientific theories, and they want to allow teachers to present both sides in the classroom. This idea is sometimes called Teach the Controversy. The Discovery Institute is known for promoting ID as an alternative to evolution, but many scientists and educators do not consider ID to be a scientifically supported theory.Every Voice is a nonprofit organization that works to make political campaigns more fair and accessible to everyone. They were formed in 2014 by combining two other groups, Public Campaign Action Fund and Friends of Democracy. Every Voice and their affiliated Super PAC, Every Voice Action, want to change the way political campaigns are funded. They believe that candidates should be able to run for office without relying on big donations from wealthy people or corporations. Instead, they want to use public money to fund campaigns, so that all candidates have a fair chance of being heard. The organization's leader, David Donnelly, has said that they are using a Super PAC to fight the influence of other Super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations from wealthy donors.

He was the son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, the leader of Clann Domhnaill, a powerful family. Aonghus Mór became the leader after his father died. At that time, the rulers of the Isles were not under the rule of the Scottish Crown, but instead owed allegiance to the Norwegian Crown. Aonghus Mór helped other Irish families fight against the English who were trying to gain power in the northwest of Ireland. This was probably because Clann Domhnaill, Aonghus Mór's family, was trying to form alliances with other Irish families to protect themselves from the Scottish, who were trying to take over their land. The Kingdom of the Isles was a group of islands in the north of Scotland and Ireland that existed from the 9th to the 13th centuries. These islands, which included the Hebrides, the Isle of Man, and the islands of the Firth of Clyde, were known to the Norse as the Suðreyjar, or Southern Isles. The kingdom wasn't always a single, continuous entity, and the islands were sometimes ruled by different people or had competing claims for control. Some rulers were independent, while others had overlords from Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland, or Orkney. The total land area of the islands is over 8,300 square kilometers and stretches for more than 500 kilometers from north to south.The title Lord of Islay was used by the leaders of the Clann Domhnaill family in the 13th and 14th centuries before they started using the title Lord of the Isles in the late 14th century. The first person to use this title was Aonghus Mór, the son of the clan's ancestor, Domhnall mac Raghnaill. Many members of the clan used this title after him. Himachal Pradesh has forests covering about 38% of its land area, which is almost 37,691 square kilometers.

The band had four members: John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. They started out playing a type of music called skiffle, which was a mix of rock and roll and folk, but they soon experimented with many different styles, including pop ballads, Indian music, psychedelia, and hard rock. They also used unusual recording techniques and added classical elements to their music. In 1963, the Beatles became incredibly famous, and as their music evolved over the years, they came to be seen as a symbol of the values of the 1960s counterculture movement, which was all about change and rebellion. David Bruce Spizer is a tax attorney in New Orleans who is also an expert on the Beatles. He has written eight books about the band and is often quoted as a source of information about their history and music.Marsha Albert, born in 1948, is credited with starting the Beatlemania craze in the United States when she was just 15 years old. In December 1963, she played a song by the Beatles called I Want to Hold Your Hand on American radio for the first time. This caused a big stir, and according to Beatles historian Bruce Spizer, her actions forced a major record company to release the band's debut single earlier than planned, which was a risky move since record companies usually don't release new music during the holiday season. This early release helped the Beatles' popularity soar, and their best-selling single worldwide became a hit. Cargo Records was a Canadian record label and distributor that was big in the 1980s and 1990s.

The team is based in Baltimore, Maryland, and competes in the American League (AL) East division. The Orioles have been around since 1901, and they were one of the original eight teams in the AL. The team started out in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as the Milwaukee Brewers, then moved to St. Louis, Missouri and became the St. Louis Browns. In 1953, the team was bought by a group of business and civic leaders in Baltimore, led by lawyer Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr. The team's current owner is lawyer Peter Angelos. Marcus Garland was a baseball player who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine seasons, from 1973 to 1981. He played for two teams, the Baltimore Orioles and the Cleveland Indians. In 1976, MLB became open to free agency, which allowed players like Garland to sign with any team they wanted. Garland signed a seven-year contract with the Cleveland Indians, but he got hurt and his performance declined. The management of the Indians was not happy with his performance and the fans booed him and even vandalized his car. This all happened because Garland's injury was not properly treated with the medical technology available at the time.The Washington Senators were one of the original teams in the American League, and they played in Washington, D.C.

One of the key features of the Argand lamp is that it burns the candle wick and oil more completely than other lamps, which means you don't need to trim the wick as often. The Lewis lamp is a special kind of light fixture that was used in lighthouses. It was invented by Winslow Lewis and was patented in 1810. One of the main benefits of the Lewis lamp was that it used less oil than other lamps that came before it. The lamp had a similar design to another type of lamp called an Argand lamp, but it also had a special mirror behind the lamp and a magnifying glass made of green bottle glass in front. This made the light brighter and more efficient. Another inventor, Aimé Argand, also created a similar version of the lamp with a parabolic reflector. While the Argand variant was popular in Europe, the Lewis lamp was chosen by the United States for use in their lighthouses.A hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is a special type of cold cathode lamp used in science experiments and research. It's used to produce a specific type of light that is helpful for measuring the properties of atoms and molecules. The lamp works by using a hollow cathode, which allows electricity to flow more easily and with more current than a regular cold cathode lamp. This makes the HCL a great tool for scientists to study the properties of light and matter. Antoine Quinquet was a pharmacist who was born in Soissons, France on March 9, 1745. In 1760, he started learning the job of an apothecary (a type of pharmacist) in Soissons. In 1777, he moved to Paris and worked for a famous pharmacist named Antoine Baumé. During his time in Paris, he met a man named Aimé Argand. In 1779, Quinquet returned to Paris and opened his own pharmacy."}], "output": "  Sure thing! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nThe lamp used in many lighthouses is similar to the Argand lamp, which was patented in 1780 by Aimé Argand. **"},

These fossils were thought to be from a type of dinosaur, but they were not well understood. The fossils include a leg bone, some backbones, and some other pieces. They were found in a layer of rock called the Chinle Formation, which is about 225 million years old. A scientist named Andrew Heckert suggested the name Cinizasaurus for the fossils, but it was never officially adopted. In 2007, some other scientists wrote a paper about the fossils and called them Cinizasaurus, but they could only say that they were from a group of animals called Archosauriformes, which includes dinosaurs and some other related animals. Sphaerotholus is a type of dinosaur that lived in the western United States and Canada during the last part of the time when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Scientists have found three different species of Sphaerotholus: one from New Mexico, one from Montana, and one from Canada. All three of these dinosaurs had dome-shaped skulls, which is where the name Sphaerotholus comes from (the word sphaira means ball in Greek).\n\nThe fact that Sphaerotholus was found in both New Mexico and Montana, and that it lived during a time period of about 7-8 million years, tells us that this dinosaur had a long lifespan and was able to live in different places. The people who first described Sphaerotholus, Williamson and Carr, say that it's different from other pachycephalosaurs because it has a special bar on its skull that gets smaller as you look towards the tail. This bar is also surrounded by special bumps called nodes. Because of these unique features, scientists think that Sphaerotholus was a highly advanced pachycephalosaur."}], "output": "  Okay, I'm ready to answer your questions!\n\nWhich came out first, Dinosaur or McFarland, USA?\n\n** McFarland, USA was released in 2015, while Dinosaur was released in 2000.

This language was spoken by people called Frisians, who lived in what is now Northern Friesland and other nearby areas. Unfortunately, there are no surviving texts from this time period that come from the coast of South Jutland, where the Frisians lived. We do know that the earlier inhabitants of this region, who lived near the Zuiderzee and Ems River, spoke a similar language, but we only have a few names and place names to go on. This earlier language eventually evolved into Middle Frisian, which was spoken from the 16th to the 19th century. The Leda is a river in northwestern Germany, in the state of Lower Saxony. It flows into the Ems River near the town of Leer. The river starts where two other rivers, the Sagter Ems and the Soeste, meet. The Leda is about 29 kilometers long, and the last 1.9 kilometers are deep enough for big ships to sail on. There's a small settlement called Kloster Muhde on the southern bank of the river, opposite Leer. The name Muhde comes from an old Frisian word for river mouth.German is a language spoken in many countries in Central Europe. It is the most common language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy (in a place called South Tyrol), Belgium (where German-speaking people live), and Liechtenstein. German is also one of the official languages in Luxembourg. Other languages that are similar to German include English, Dutch, and Frisian languages. German is the second most widely spoken Germanic language, after English. English is a language that originated in early medieval England and is now widely spoken around the world. It gets its name from the Angles, a group of Germanic tribes who moved to England. The word English actually comes from the Anglia peninsula in the Baltic Sea. This language is closely related to Frisian languages, but it has borrowed many words from other Germanic languages like Norse and Romance languages like French."}], "output": "  ** The Western Germanic language was spoken in the region where the small settlement of Kloster Muhde is located, opposite Leer.**"},

The song Within You Without You was written by George Harrison and included on the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It was Harrison's second song using Indian music styles, and it was inspired by his trip to India to learn from his mentor Ravi Shankar. The song features Indian instruments like the sitar, dilruba, and tabla, and was recorded in London without the other Beatles. The song's music and lyrics are different from the Beatles' other work, and they reflect Harrison's interest in Hinduism and yoga.

Jon was born in Iceland but now lives in Canada. The film follows three Icelandic Canadians as they go to Iceland to learn more about their Icelandic heritage. The film shows how they react to the Islendingadagurinn celebration in Gimli, Canada. The film is about how these three people see their ancestral heritage differently from each other and from the rest of Canadian culture. The Five Obstructions is a documentary film made in 2003 by Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth. The movie is a mix of documentary and experimental filmmaking. Lars, who is a famous filmmaker, challenges his friend and mentor Jørgen, also a famous filmmaker, to remake one of his old films called The Perfect Human five times, each time with a new obstacle or challenge given by Lars. This is because Lars loves The Perfect Human and wants to see how Jørgen will adapt to these obstacles.A film laboratory is a place where filmmakers can go to get their film developed and printed. They can choose from different types of film, such as black and white or color, and different sizes like 35mm or 8mm. The laboratory charges based on how much footage is developed or how much time is spent in the lab. In Pristina, music composition and composers have made a significant impact. The traditional Kosovan folklore has influenced many different genres of music, and these genres have developed and become popular over the years. Instead of grouping all composers and their works into one category, we will highlight the unique contributions of each composer and the different genres they have worked in. This will give you a better understanding of the diverse range of music in Pristina and the talented composers who have created it."}], "output": "  Yes, The Importance of Being Icelandic and The Five Obstructions belong to different film genres.\n\nThe Importance of Being Icelandic is a documentary film, specifically a cultural documentary, as it explores the heritage and identity of Icelandic Canadians and their experiences with the Islendingadagurinn celebration.\n\nThe Five Obstructions, on the other hand, is an experimental documentary film that combines elements of documentary and experimental filmmaking. It challenges the traditional notion of filmmaking by presenting a series of obstacles or challenges to the filmmaker, Jørgen Leth, as he remakes one of his old films, The Perfect Human.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that The Importance of Being Icelandic and The Five Obstructions belong to different film genres, with the former being a cultural documentary and the latter being an experimental documentary. **"},

He was accused of killing an American soldier and pleaded guilty to the crime. However, he later said that he only pleaded guilty so he could go back to Canada. Khadr sued the Canadian government because they violated his rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The lawsuit was settled in 2017, and the government paid him $10.5 million and apologized for what happened. The documentary Son of al Qaeda tells the story of Abdurahman Khadr, a Canadian man whose father was a friend of Osama bin Laden. Abdurahman's younger brother, Omar, was also held at the Guantanamo Bay prison. The documentary explores the experiences of Abdurahman and his family, who were caught up in the events of 9/11 and the subsequent war on terror.In California, there was a lawsuit called Fraley, et al. v. Facebook, Inc., et al. against Facebook because the company used people's names and pictures in ads without their permission. This is called misappropriation. The lawsuit was a group case, or a class action. The people who were part of the lawsuit, called class members, received $15 each as part of a settlement. The settlement checks were sent out starting on November 17, 2016. A liability insurance company has a responsibility to try to settle claims fairly and quickly when it's clear that their policyholder is at fault. This means the insurance company should try to reach a settlement that is fair and reasonable, and they should keep the policyholder informed of any settlement offers. If the insurance company refuses a reasonable settlement offer and the court awards a larger judgment against the policyholder, the insurance company may be responsible for the entire amount above the policy limits. This is because the insurance company has a conflict of interest between protecting their own financial interests and doing what's best for the policyholder. The insurance company should not deny coverage based on their own beliefs about whether the policy provides coverage, and they should not coerce the policyholder into contributing to a settlement fund unreasonably."}], "output": "  ** $10.5 million **"},

He was born on May 7, 1896, and died on November 16, 1982. He wrote about 300 papers, and his work was very important in the fields of set theory and topology. Semyon Gershgorin was a mathematician who lived in Russia. He was born in Pruzhany, Belarus in 1901 and studied at the Petrograd Technological Institute, where he became a professor in 1930. He also worked at the Leningrad Mechanical Engineering Institute. One of his most important contributions was the discovery of the Gershgorin circle theorem.In topology, the nerve of an open covering is a way to understand the topological properties of a space X by using a collection of simpler objects called simplicial complexes. This construction was introduced by Pavel Alexandrov and has been modified and expanded upon in various ways, including the Čech nerve and hypercoverings. These variations help us understand the properties of X in a more algorithmic and combinatorial way. Pavel Urysohn was a famous mathematician from Russia who lived from 1898 to 1924. He made important contributions to a field called dimension theory, and his work is still used today in a branch of math called topology. Two of his most important ideas are called Urysohn's Metrization Theorem and Urysohn's Lemma. These ideas are so important that they are still used today to measure the size of spaces and to study shapes. Even today, math terms like Urysohn universal space, Fréchet-Urysohn space, Menger-Urysohn dimension, and Urysohn integral equation are still used by mathematicians to describe different concepts in topology. In 1923, Urysohn and another mathematician named Pavel Alexandrov came up with a new way to define what it means for a space to be compact. This idea is still used in math today."}], "output": "  Based on the information provided in the passage, Pavel Alexandrov has written more than 300 papers. The passage states that he wrote \"about 300 papers,\" which implies that the exact number is unknown but is greater than 300. In contrast, Semyon Gershgorin is not mentioned as having written any specific number of papers. Therefore, the answer is Pavel Alexandrov. **"},

It stood at 348 feet tall and was located at 64-66 Broadway. The building was designed by architects Kimball & Thompson, and it was a significant structure because it was the first skyscraper in Manhattan to reach a height of over 100 meters. In 1904, the building was extended slightly to the north, making its new address 64-70 Broadway. 712 5th Avenue is a very tall building in Manhattan, New York City. It's over 650 feet tall and is located at the corner of 56th Street and Fifth Avenue in the Midtown neighborhood. The building was built between 1990 and 1991, and it's the 53rd tallest building in the city. The people who built the building had to make sure that the design didn't ruin the special facades of two other buildings nearby, called the Coty and Rizzoli Buildings. The building was bought by a group called the Bannister Trust in 2007, and it's now managed by JP Morgan. Some people call the building the Henri Bendel building.Whole life insurance is a type of life insurance that lasts for your entire lifetime, as long as you pay the required premiums. It's like a contract between you and the insurance company, where they promise to pay a death benefit to your beneficiaries when you pass away, as long as you follow the terms of the contract. Because whole life insurance is guaranteed to last your whole life, the premiums are usually higher than term life insurance, which only lasts for a set period of time. The good news is that the premiums are fixed, so they won't increase as you get older. You'll typically pay premiums until you die, unless you have a limited pay policy, which might be paid up after a certain number of years (like 10, 20, or 65). Whole life insurance is a type of cash value insurance, which means it can build up value over time and be used for other purposes. Manhattan Life Insurance Company was founded on May 29, 1850, and is based in New York. However, it is now a subsidiary of Manhattan Life Group, which is located in Houston, Texas. So, while the company is technically headquartered in New York, it is managed and operated by Manhattan Life Group in Texas."}], "output": "  Sure thing!

These ferns are part of a family called Marsileaceae, and the name Marsilea comes from an Italian naturalist named Luigi Ferdinando Marsili who lived in the 1600s. Brabejum is a type of tree that only grows in South Africa's Western Cape Province. It's called wild almond, bitter almond, or ghoeboontjie. The tree has branches that grow close to the ground and lots of tall, straight stems. The leaves are long and skinny, with teeth on the edges, and they grow in groups of six. In the summer, the tree produces white flowers that grow in clusters at the base of the leaves. The fruit is shaped like an almond and is red or purple. But the fruit is too bitter to eat, so people used to boil, roast, or grind it to make a special coffee drink.Sinocyclocheilus is a type of fish that lives in freshwater in China.

The fish that live above ground or in underground rivers don't have these special features and are a bit smaller, reaching up to 9 inches long. Unfortunately, many of these fish are in danger because their populations are small and limited to just a few places. Scientists haven't studied all of the different species yet, but those that have been evaluated are considered threatened. Myiodynastes is a group of birds that includes five different species, all of which are commonly known as sulphur-bellied flycatchers. This name refers to one of the individual species in the group, and it was first used by a scientist named Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1857. The name Myiodynastes comes from two Greek words: muia means fly, and dunastẽs means ruler.

Boren or United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.? \n\n Passage: In 1948, the United States Supreme Court made a big decision about movie studios owning their own theaters and controlling which theaters would show their movies. This case, called United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., changed the way movies were made, distributed, and shown in theaters. The court ruled that the way movie studios were doing business was against the law, which prohibits exclusive deals that limit competition. This decision had a big impact on the movie industry and how movies were produced, distributed, and shown in theaters. In the case of Craig v. Boren, the Supreme Court made a big decision that changed the way laws are looked at when it comes to treating men and women equally. This case was the first time when most of the judges on the Supreme Court agreed that laws that are based on gender should be closely examined to make sure they are fair. This is important because it means that laws that discriminate against one gender or the other will be looked at more closely and might be found to be unfair.Block booking is a system where movie studios sell a group of films to theaters as a package deal. This was the standard practice in Hollywood from the 1930s until 1948, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was illegal. Under block booking, theaters had to buy a bunch of movies from a studio without seeing them first. This allowed the studios to mix in lower-quality movies with the good ones, which made it cheaper to produce and distribute their films. The part of the system where theaters buy movies without seeing them is called blind bidding. In 1971, the Minnesota Supreme Court said that a law that only allowed married couples of the opposite sex was constitutional. The decision was later appealed to the United States Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court didn't think there was a big enough issue to consider, so they dismissed the case. This meant that the Minnesota Supreme Court's decision stood, and it became a precedent. However, the precedent was later overruled by the Supreme Court in 2015 when same-sex marriage became legal nationwide.\n\nHere's a list of the changes I made"}], "output": "  Sure, I'd be happy to help!

The sarod has a deep, rich sound that's different from the sitar's bright and smooth sound. The sarod has special strings that make it sound more resonant and echoey. It's also a fretless instrument, which means it can make smooth transitions between notes, called glissandi, that are important in Indian music.Chander Bari is a Bengali movie made in 2007 by director Tarun Majumdar.

It was invented in 1893 by J.W. Pepper, who made it easier to play while standing or marching. The instrument is shaped like a circle and has a big bell that points forward, which helps project the sound. Because it's easier to carry and has a clear, loud sound, the sousaphone is often used in marching bands and other types of music. It was originally made of brass, but now it's also made from lighter materials like fiberglass."}], "output": "  **Sarod**"},

The race is 25 laps around an Olympic-sized track, which is a pretty long distance. Because of its length, this race is not always held at every track and field meeting.

It's published by Time Inc. UK and edited by Ali Hall. The magazine covers the latest fashion trends, gives advice on how to shop on a budget, and features celebrity style and news. It also includes real-life stories that young women can relate to. Chrysalis: A Magazine of Women's Culture was a feminist publication that ran from 1977 to 1980. It was started by Kirsten Grimstad and Susan Rennie at the Woman's Building in Los Angeles. Chrysalis was different from other feminist magazines because it combined politics, literature, culture, and art in one publication. The magazine was made by a group of women who worked together, using the feminist practice of consciousness-raising. Many important feminist thinkers and artists contributed to the magazine, including Audre Lorde, Robin Morgan, Adrienne Rich, and Judy Chicago. Despite the high quality of its content, the magazine had to stop publishing after three years due to financial difficulties.In Malaysia, the first women's magazine was published in 1932.

Thomas Friedman is an American journalist and writer who was born on July 20, 1953.

Bergson believed that reality is not made up of separate moments or states, but rather it's a continuous process, like a river flowing. He argued that reality is always changing and can't be fully understood by breaking it down into smaller parts. Instead, we need to look at reality as a whole, and intuition is the way to do this. Bergson believed that intuition allows us to directly experience reality, rather than just analyzing it from different angles. Henri Bergson, a French philosopher, developed a theory called duration that explores how we experience time and consciousness. He believed that traditional philosophers like Herbert Spencer didn't fully understand the nature of time because they didn't consider the role of mechanics. Bergson realized that when we try to measure time, it's already passed and can't be captured in a single moment. Time can feel different for each person, either speeding up or slowing down, but for science, time remains the same. Bergson focused on the inner experiences of individuals, which he called duration, and believed that it can't be fully explained with words, only through images and intuition."}], "output": "  **Thomas Friedman has won more Pulitzer Prizes.**"},

You can find things like sex toys, room decor, collectible figures, fashion jewelry, and horror-themed items in their stores. They also own and operate a seasonal retailer called Spirit Halloween.Warehouse stores are like supermarkets that offer lower prices on food and groceries. They don't have fancy decorations or memberships like warehouse clubs do. Instead, they focus on selling a lot of items at a lower cost. When you enter the store, you'll see discounted items right away. Then, you'll find fresh produce, the deli, bakery, and other departments like in a regular supermarket. One thing that's different is that you'll have to bag your own groceries, which helps keep costs down.

This means that an action is considered right if it helps more people than it harms, except for the person who does the action themselves. This idea is often summed up as doing good for others is what matters most. Some people who believe in this idea are called altruists. One famous version of altruism is from a man named Auguste Comte, who said that we should live for the benefit of others. Alice Lloyd College is a four-year college located in Pippa Passes, Kentucky.

This name is used for male descendants who don't have royal titles or styles. Some people with royal titles have used Mountbatten-Windsor as their surname when it was necessary to have one. This rule was established in 1960 by the Privy Council. The Mountbatten family is a noble family that originated in Germany but later changed their name due to World War I. The name Mountbatten is an anglicized version of the town of Battenberg, where the family's ancestors lived. During the war, the family members living in the United Kingdom changed their name to Mountbatten because there was a lot of anti-German feeling among the British people. The family's title, Count of Battenberg, was given to them by a smaller branch of the House of Hesse, which is also a noble family.The Zulu royal family is made up of the current king of the Zulus in South Africa, King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu, his wives and children, as well as his ancestors and other close relatives.

Shaka's leadership and military conquests turned the Zulu clan into one of the most powerful and influential tribes in South Africa, covering a large area that is now known as KwaZulu-Natal. In the past, the younger sons of kings and noble leaders would often inherit less wealth and power than their older brothers. This was because the family's important assets, like land, titles, and money, would typically be passed down from father to oldest son. These younger sons were called cadets.

They work by increasing protein within cells, especially in muscles. These steroids are similar to the male hormone testosterone and can have different effects, like making the voice deeper and body hair grow. The word anabolic comes from the Greek word for throwing up or mound. These steroids are one of three types of hormones that work in the body, the other two being estrogens and progestogens. Anabolic/androgenic steroids are drugs that come from the male hormone testosterone. These drugs help build muscle and increase strength for looks and athletic performance. They work by increasing protein production in muscles and stopping the process of breaking down muscle for energy. Many teens and adults use steroids because they make muscles grow much faster than natural exercise and diet.Docking refers to the removal of part of an animal's tail or ears. This practice is sometimes called cropping when it involves the ears, and tailing when it involves the tail. The term docking comes from the fact that the living flesh of the tail, where the tail hairs grow, is called the dock. Tensile testing is a way to measure the strength of materials. It involves stretching a sample until it breaks, and the results can help us choose the right material for a job, check the quality of the material, and predict how it will perform under normal use. The test measures three important properties: how strong the material is, how much it can stretch, and how much it will shrink. From these measurements, we can figure out other important properties like how flexible the material is and how it will respond to stress. Most of the time, we use a simple test called uniaxial tensile testing for materials that are the same all the way through, like metal rods. But for materials that are different in different directions, like fabric or composite materials, we need to use a special test called biaxial tensile testing."}], "output": "  **Answer: Anabolic steroids**\n\nAnabolic steroids are commonly used in bodybuilding to increase muscle mass and strength.

The highway starts at the Tennessee state line near Bristol and ends at the West Virginia state line near Winchester.Interstate 40 is a big road that goes across North Carolina, from the mountains in the west to the coast in the east. It starts in Tennessee and goes through many cities, like Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Durham, and Raleigh. The road goes through different kinds of landscapes, like mountains, hills, and farmland. It's the longest interstate highway in North Carolina, and there are other roads that connect to it. The road is labeled as going east and west, but the part that goes to the coast is more like a north-south road. There are 32 Interstate Highways in New York, including 9 main routes and 23 auxiliary routes. These highways are mostly maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), but there are some exceptions. Unlike in other states, Interstate Highways in New York are not referred to by their number alone; instead, the letter I is added to the number on signs and in documents. This means that there can be duplicate numbers between Interstate Highways and state routes, like I-86 and NY-86. However, the I suffix helps to distinguish between the two. For example, 86I refers to the Interstate Highway, while 86 refers to the state route."}], "output": "  Sure thing!

The town has been making textiles since the 1300s, when Flemish weavers moved there and brought their skills with them. During the Industrial Revolution, the town grew and became a boomtown in the 1800s. At its peak in 1929, Bolton had 216 cotton mills and 26 factories that dyed and bleached cotton. The town was one of the biggest and most productive places in the world for making cotton. However, the cotton industry in Britain declined after World War I, and by the 1980s, most cotton manufacturing had stopped in Bolton. Rivington Hall Barn is located near Chorley and Bolton, in Rivington, Lancashire. The barn is believed to have been built between the 9th and 13th centuries, but it was most likely built in the 16th century. In 1905, the barn was restored, changed, and made larger by Jonathan Simpson for Lord Leverhulme.

They work by expanding and contracting air as it gets hotter and cooler, which helps convert heat into movement. These engines can be based on different ways of using hot air, like the designs of Sir George Cayley, John Ericsson, and Robert Stirling. They're different from the more well-known internal combustion engines and steam engines. Sir George Cayley was a British engineer who lived from 1773 to 1857. He is considered one of the most important people in the history of flight. Many people think he was the first person to really understand how planes fly and the forces that make them fly. He did a lot of research and experimentation to figure out how to make planes work, and his discoveries helped pave the way for modern aviation.Elliott J. Stoddard invented two versions of an engine called the Stoddard engine. The first one was patented in 1919, and the second one was patented in 1933. This engine is a type of external combustion engine, which means that the fuel burns outside of the engine instead of inside it like in a traditional internal combustion engine. The engine uses valves and a single-phase gaseous working fluid, like hot air or other gases like helium or hydrogen. Charles Boreham was a shearer and union leader who was born in Tasmania, Australia on December 19, 1857. He later moved to New Zealand, where he became a prominent figure in the labor movement and fought for the rights of workers."}], "output": "  Sure thing!

The collection was published in 1928. In the article, Freud suggests that it's not a coincidence that many of the greatest works of literature, such as Oedipus Rex and Hamlet, feature characters who commit parricide (killing one's own parent). Freud also links Dostoevsky's own experience with epilepsy to the theme of parricide in his writing. Oedipus Rex, also known as Oedipus the King, is a famous play by Sophocles that was first performed in 429 BC. The original title of the play was just Oedipus (oh-ee-DOH-pus), but it was later renamed Oedipus Tyrannus (tye-RAN-nus) to distinguish it from another play called Oedipus at Colonus. In ancient Greece, the word tyrant didn't always have a negative meaning - it just meant that the person was a ruler. So, Oedipus Tyrannus basically means Oedipus the Ruler.In his book The Interpretation of Dreams, published in 1899, Sigmund Freud introduced his theory of the unconscious mind and how it relates to dreams. He also talked about what would become known as the Oedipus complex. Freud made changes to the book several times, and in the third edition, he added a big section about the symbols in dreams. He believed that this work was a once-in-a-lifetime discovery. Freud: A Life for Our Time is a biography of Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis, written by historian Peter Gay in 1988. This book is based on new information that has come to light since the publication of Ernest Jones' The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud in 1953. While the book has received praise, some authors who are skeptical of psychoanalysis have criticized it."}], "output": "  Sure thing!

Gibb or Reynolds v. Sims? \n\n Passage: In the Reynolds v. Sims case, the US Supreme Court ruled that state legislative districts must have roughly the same number of people in each district. This means that the districts can't be skewed in favor of one area or another, like how some states had traditionally given more power to rural areas by giving them more representatives. The case was brought by a man named M.O. Sims, who lived in Alabama, but it affected many other states that had not reapportioned their legislatures based on changes in population. The case was important because it made sure that all voters have equal representation in their state governments, regardless of where they live. In the case of Selle v. Gibb, the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals made an important ruling about the doctrine of striking similarities. This means that if one person's work is very similar to another person's work, it could be considered proof that the first person copied the second person's work. However, the court ruled that just because two things are similar doesn't necessarily mean that one person copied the other. To prove that someone copied another person's work, you need to show that they had access to the original work and that the similarities are not just a coincidence. If there's no evidence that one person had access to the other's work, then similarities alone can't be used to prove that one person copied the other. The similarities need to be so strong that they prove it would have been impossible for the second person to come up with the same ideas on their own.The first case to be heard by the United States Supreme Court was West v. Barnes, which took place in 1791. This case was significant because it was the first time the Court required oral arguments. Two other cases, Van Staphorst v. Maryland and Collet v. Collet, were docketed before West v. Barnes, but they were settled before the Court could hear them. West v. Barnes was argued on August 2, 1791, and the decision was made on August 3, 1791. However, the justices' full opinions were not published in a formal Supreme Court Reporter, but instead were printed in newspapers around the country. Instead, Alexander Dallas, the Supreme Court Reporter, published a brief summary of the decisions. Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd was a court case in England about whether newspapers can publish false statements about people if it's in the public interest. The case was heard by the House of Lords, which is like the highest court in the country. The court had to decide if newspapers can be protected from lawsuits if they publish false statements about someone if it's in the public interest. This is called qualified privilege."}], "output": "  Sure thing! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nQuestion: Which case was decided first, Selle v. Gibb or Reynolds v.

The Bedouin people call them the Works of the Old Men. These structures are believed to have been used for hunting wild animals, and they consist of long walls that converge on a narrow space, called a killing floor. The walls can be hundreds of meters long and are best seen from the air. Scientists have found over 2,000 of these structures in Jordan and Syria, but none in Saudi Arabia.\n\nResearchers have studied the desert kites and found that they were mainly used to hunt herds of gazelle, a type of wild animal that is now extinct. The kites are between 3 and 5 thousand years old, and some scientists believe that they were built by people who were already growing most of their food, rather than hunter-gatherers. Some of the kites have rock art near them, which suggests that the hunt was an important event that brought people together from different settlements and may have had religious significance.

It's often enjoyed before bedtime or when it's cold or rainy outside. Some people believe that the drink can help relieve symptoms of the cold and flu. The honey in the drink can soothe your throat, while the alcohol can help numb any discomfort. According to one author, Victoria Moore, the drink is like a vitamin C for your health. Kir is a tasty French drink made with blackcurrant liqueur and white wine. To make it, you need to measure out some crème de cassis (which is a sweet, fruity liqueur made from blackcurrants) and then top it up with white wine. This creates a delicious and refreshing drink that's perfect for sipping on a hot day or as an accompaniment to a meal.The Nadar community has a large group called the Nadar climbers, also known as Pannayeri Nadars or Pannayeri Shanars. These people were the main part of the Nadar community and were known for farming palmyra trees and making jaggery (a type of sugar).

However, most Nadar climbers have stopped doing these traditional jobs and have moved on to other careers like education, business, and other important fields. In Argentina and Uruguay, there's a special drink called submarino (which means submarine in Spanish) or remo (meaning oar). It's made by melting dark chocolate in hot milk, then stirring it with a long spoon (like an iced tea spoon) until the chocolate is fully dissolved."}], "output": "  **Hot toddy**"},

He was known for creating beautiful pieces of furniture that were typical of the Mid-Century modern style. Risom was one of the first designers to bring Scandinavian design to the United States, making him very influential in the world of furniture design. Scandinavian design is a style of design that originated in the 1950s in the five Nordic countries of Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark. This design movement is known for its simplicity, minimalism, and functionality. While the term Scandinavia only refers to Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, it is often used to include all five countries.Charles Lim, the founder of Peliontech, created a new type of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software called Workflow Resource Planning (WRP) in 2003. Traditional ERP systems were designed for data entry and processing, but Mr. Lim's WRP software included workflow functionality, making it easier to manage tasks and processes within the system. This was a new approach to ERP systems, as previous systems like Lotus Notes focused on workflow management but fell out of favor in the early 2000s. Mr. Lim combined the best elements of these earlier systems with his own ideas to create Radix ERP, a more advanced and efficient ERP system with built-in workflow management. An NTFS symbolic link (symlink) is a special type of file on your computer that points to another file or directory. You can think of it like a shortcut that takes you to a different location on your computer. Symbolic links are transparent to you, the user, and they look and act like regular files or directories. You can interact with them just like you would with any other file or directory.\n\nWindows 2000 introduced a new type of symbolic link called a junction point, which points to an entire directory or volume. This means you can create a symbolic link that takes you to a whole folder or drive, instead of just a single file.\n\nStarting with Windows XP, symbolic links could be created for any type of file system object, not just directories and volumes. However, this feature was not available to user mode applications until Windows Vista. This means that you needed to install special software, like the Masatoshi Kimura's opensource codice_1 driver, to make the feature available in user mode. But with Windows Vista, the functionality is available by default, so you don't need to install any extra software to use symbolic links in user mode."}], "output": "  Sure thing!

Our eyes see blue when we look at light that has a special wavelength, between 450 and 495 tiny little measurements called nanometers. The blue color we see can be different shades, depending on the wavelength. Shorter wavelengths look more violet, while longer wavelengths look more green. The middle color, which is pure blue, has a wavelength of 470 nanometers. Blue is one of the three main colors that artists use to make other colors, along with red and yellow. When you mix blue and red together, you get violet. When you mix blue and yellow together, you get green. Blue is also one of the main colors on your computer or TV screen, and it helps create all the other colors you see there. Innocent Records was a pop music label created by Virgin Records to focus on more pop-oriented acts. After the success of the Spice Girls, Virgin Records wanted to explore the pop market. They hired Hugh Goldsmith from RCA Records, who had helped Take That become a multi-platinum act. Goldsmith started his own label within Virgin Records, and his first signings were Billie Piper and Martine McCutcheon, as well as some dance acts like Todd Terry.

It has a very wide range of colors, covering over 90% of all possible colors that can be seen by the human eye. This means that it can accurately represent a wide variety of colors, including those found in real-world scenes. The ProPhoto RGB color space is even larger than the Wide-gamut RGB color space, which is another popular color space used in digital photography. One downside of the ProPhoto RGB color space is that it includes some imaginary colors that do not exist and cannot be seen by the human eye. These colors are not a problem for most photographers, but they can cause issues with some software and printers. The YCoCg color model is a way of representing colors using three values: luma (Y), chrominance green (Cg), and chrominance orange (Co). This color model is commonly used in video and image compression algorithms like H.264, HEVC, JPEG XR, and Dirac. One of the reasons it's used is that it's easy to calculate and can be compressed well using transform coding. Plus, it can be converted back and forth to RGB (the standard color model) without losing any information and using fewer bits than other color models."}], "output": "  Question: What act for Innocent Records achieved Platinum sales and shares its name with a primary color in the RGB color model?\n\nAnswer: Blue.**\n\nExplanation: The passage mentions that Innocent Records signed the act Blue, which achieved platinum sales.

Shirer, an American journalist, wrote a book called Berlin Diary (1934-1941) about his experiences witnessing the rise of Nazi Germany and its path to war. As a radio reporter for CBS, Shirer lived in Germany for several years and talked to many people to learn about what was happening. However, the Nazi government did not want the public to know the truth, so they censored Shirer's reports and made it difficult for him to report objectively. Feeling uncomfortable and worried for his sources, Shirer left Germany. To protect his sources from the Gestapo (the German secret police), Shirer disguised their identities in his book. The information in Berlin Diary was later used to write his famous book The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. In 2002, a research team from the University of Ghent discovered a new species of mole rat, which they named Fukomys vandewoestijneae or Caroline's mole rat.

The book was written by Nancy Mitford and first published in 1957. It not only shares the love story between Voltaire and Émilie, but also gives insight into the French Enlightenment, which was a time of great change and ideas in France. Gabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, also known as the Marquise Du Châtelet, was a smart and talented French woman who lived in the 1700s. She was a mathematician, physicist, and writer who made important contributions to science. One of her biggest achievements was translating and explaining Isaac Newton's book Principia, which contains the basic laws of physics. This translation was published after she died, in 1759, and it's still considered the best French translation of the book today. In her commentary, she added a valuable idea to Newton's theories - the idea that there is a law that keeps track of the total energy of an object, which includes the energy of motion. This idea is still important in physics today.Katherine Kath was a famous French ballerina who performed at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris.

He was elected in 2002 and served until 2008, but he had to resign because he was found guilty of lying under oath and obstructing justice. He was sentenced to four months in jail, but he only served 99 days and was released on probation. The mayoral election in Detroit took place in two parts: a primary on February 24, 2009, and the main election on May 5, 2009. The reason for this was that the previous mayor, Kwame Kilpatrick, had resigned, so there was a vacancy that needed to be filled.Jane Marum Roush is a lawyer and judge who was appointed to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court of Virginia. Her appointment was temporary and was set to expire after 30 days if the state legislature didn't elect her to a full 12-year term. However, the legislature didn't make a decision before they adjourned, and there's a question about whether the adjournment was valid. The governor thinks the legislature was still in session, but the House of Delegates and some Senate Republicans say the adjournment was invalid. Because of this legal uncertainty, it's not clear if the governor could fill the vacancy again. If the second appointment is valid, it expired on February 12, 2016, but it's still unclear if it was valid or not. Here's a list of municipal elections held in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Until 1923, the mayor was elected annually, but then the term changed to two years. In 1971, the mayoral term became three years, and the elections for councillors and aldermen also changed to three years. Before that, councillors were elected every year, but in 1971, their terms started overlapping with the mayoral elections. In 1976, the number of wards increased to 14, and each ward now has one alderman for three years. In 2010, the title of councillor was adopted instead of alderman. And in 2012, the Local Authorities Election Act was changed to make the mayor and councillors' terms four years long."}], "output": "  Sure thing!

It's part of a system in the body called the renin-angiotensin system, which is a main target for drugs that treat high blood pressure. When angiotensin is present, it tells the adrenal glands to release another hormone called aldosterone. This hormone helps the body retain sodium, which can also raise blood pressure. All of these changes can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Aldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that helps regulate the amount of sodium and potassium in our body. It does this by controlling how much sodium is reabsorbed into the body and how much potassium is excreted. This process affects blood pressure, blood volume, and water balance. If aldosterone levels are out of balance, it can lead to problems like high blood pressure and kidney disease. Aldosterone has the opposite effect of atrial natriuretic hormone, which is secreted by the heart and helps regulate sodium and potassium levels.The sodium-chloride symporter (also known as Na-Cl cotransporter) is a protein in the kidney that helps bring sodium and chloride ions back into the body's cells. It does this by reabsorbing these ions from the fluid that flows through the tiny tubes in the kidney called the distal convoluted tubule. This protein is part of a family of cotransporters called SLC12, which help move electrically charged ions like sodium and chloride into and out of cells. In humans, this protein is created by a gene called SLC12A3, which is found on chromosome 16. The loop of Henle is a part of the nephron in the kidney that connects the proximal convoluted tubule to the distal convoluted tubule. It's named after the German anatomist Friedrich Gustav Jakob Henle who discovered it. The loop of Henle's main job is to create a concentration gradient in the medulla of the kidney. This helps the kidney filter waste and keep the body healthy."}], "output": "  Sure thing! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nThe hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron is aldosterone.**"},

Thompkins and Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan which one was a  case decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court of the United States? \n\n Passage: In 1982, the Supreme Court of the United States decided a case called Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan. The court ruled that the university's policy of only accepting women as students was unfair and violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The court voted 5-4 in favor of the decision. This means that the court decided that the policy was not fair and violated the Constitution. In Berghuis v. Thompkins, a case decided by the US Supreme Court in 2010 (case number 08-1470), the Court looked at what happens when a person being questioned by the police understands their right to remain silent, but doesn't explicitly say so or waive that right. In other words, the Court considered what happens when a suspect is aware of their Miranda rights but doesn't explicitly exercise them.In the case of Hoffman v. Jones, the Supreme Court of Florida made a groundbreaking decision that changed the way negligence cases are handled. This case was the first time a state supreme court abandoned the long-standing doctrine of contributory negligence, which prevented injured victims from receiving compensation if they were even slightly at fault for the incident. Instead, the court adopted the concept of comparative negligence, which allows victims to be compensated for the percentage of harm caused by the at-fault person. This decision was a significant departure from the previous rule and has been widely cited in law school textbooks. As a result, comparative negligence is now the prevailing doctrine in negligence cases.\n\nIn simpler terms, the Florida Supreme Court made a major change to the way negligence cases are handled. Before this case, if someone was injured and they were even a little bit at fault, they couldn't get any compensation. But the court decided that instead of following this old rule, they would now look at how much the at-fault person was responsible for the injury, and the victim would get compensated based on that percentage. This change has been widely accepted and is now the standard way of handling negligence cases. In 1791, the first case to be docketed with the United States Supreme Court was Van Staphorst v. Maryland. However, the case was settled before the court could hear oral arguments. Instead, the first appellate case to be heard by the court was Collet v. Collet. The first case to be decided by the court was West v. Barnes."}], "output": "  Sure thing!

He is also known for a funny story he wrote about science for a magazine called OMNI. The story is called the Buttered Cat Paradox. The buttered cat paradox is a funny joke that plays on two well-known sayings. It's like a puzzle that combines two ideas that don't quite make sense together, but are both familiar and easy to understand. The joke is based on the idea that if you butter a cat, it will make the cat slippery and unable to land on its feet. This is a play on the idea that butter is slippery, and that cats are known for their agility and ability to land on their feet. The paradox is that if you butter a cat, it would make the cat unable to do what it's known for doing well.Yasuda Dai Circus is a group of three comedians from Japan who make people laugh with their funny antics and loud, boisterous style.

The plane was a Boeing 707-436, and the pilot in command was Captain Bernard Dobson, a 45-year-old pilot from Dorset who had been flying this type of plane since November 1960. The Boeing 707 is a type of airplane that was made by Boeing from 1958 to 1979. It's a mid-sized plane that can carry between 140 and 219 people, depending on the version. The plane has four engines and can fly long distances, with a range of around 2,500 miles. The name 707 is pronounced as seven oh seven.BOAC Flight 712, also known as Speedbird 712, was a flight from London Heathrow Airport to Sydney with stops in Zurich and Singapore. On April 8, 1968, the Boeing 707-465 aircraft experienced an engine failure during takeoff, which caused a major fire. The engine actually fell off the plane while it was in the air! Luckily, the plane was able to make an emergency landing, but there were some problems during the evacuation. There was confusion over the checklists and the presence of a check captain (a captain who is training another pilot) distracted the crew. Unfortunately, five of the 127 people on board died in the incident. Silver Shadow is a cruise ship that started carrying passengers in 2000. It can hold up to 382 people and has 295 crew members. The ship is similar to another one called Silver Whisper, which was also built by Mariotti Shipyard in Genoa, Italy. Both ships have a lot of space for each passenger, with a space-to-passenger ratio of 74. This means there's more space per person than on any other cruise ship. Plus, there are fewer crew members compared to the number of passengers, with a ratio of about 1 crew member for every 1.31 passengers."}], "output": "  Sure thing! Here's the answer to your question:\n\nThe largest passenger capacity of the Boeing 707 plane type used for BOAC Flight 911 was 219 people, depending on the version. **"},

They were together for 20 years and had ten children, but their relationship was not recognized as legal marriage. The children took the surname FitzClarence. Elizabeth Hay, also known as the Countess of Erroll, was born in 1801 to King William IV and his mistress, Dorothea Jordan. She married William Hay, who became the Earl of Erroll, and they got married when she was just 19 years old. Because of her father's position, William Hay became an important official in the royal household. They got married at a church in London called St. George's, Hanover Square. Elizabeth kept some special mementos from her father, including a stone that was thrown at him and the gloves he wore when he first opened Parliament. She died in Edinburgh, Scotland.Amelia Cary, also known as Viscountess Falkland, was a British noblewoman. She was born on March 21, 1807, as the fifth illegitimate daughter of William IV, who later became the King of the United Kingdom. Her mother was his long-time mistress, Dorothea Jordan.

His mother's side of the family was related to William IV of the United Kingdom through Elizabeth Hay, Countess of Erroll, one of William's illegitimate daughters with his mistress, Dorothea Jordan. This made the 5th Marquess the first member of the Bute family to be descended from William IV."}], "output": "  Sure! The birthday of Dorothea Jordan, the Anglo-Irish actress, courtesan, and mistress of King William IV, is not explicitly stated in the passage. However, based on the information provided, we can infer that she was born sometime in the late 18th or early 19th century, as she was described as a \"famous actress\" and the \"secret lover\" of King William IV. Additionally, her daughter Elizabeth Hay was born in 1801, which suggests that Dorothea Jordan was likely born sometime before or around 1800. However, without further information, it is not possible to determine her exact birthdate."}]

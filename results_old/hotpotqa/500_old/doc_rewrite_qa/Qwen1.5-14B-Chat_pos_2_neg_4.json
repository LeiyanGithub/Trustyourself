This can include lowering interest rates or monthly payments, or reducing the amount owed. Banks do this to help borrowers avoid losing their homes (foreclosure). This practice became more common after the 2008 housing market crash in the US, especially from banks like Washington Mutual, Chase, and JP Morgan. The government, IRS, and President Obama's letters helped borrowers get help to keep their homes. This led to the creation of loan modification programs like HAMP and HARP. Before these modifications, people would use different methods like loan assumptions and transfers to deal with financial problems. During the Great Depression, the government tried to stop foreclosures by setting rules and investigating illegal actions by lenders. The 2008 crash brought loan modifications as a national policy to prevent further problems. The main issue was that some lenders took advantage of homeowners by hiding the true cost of their mortgages, especially with balloon mortgages. Modifications helped fix these issues by making mortgage terms fairer and stopping illegal practices. Many people involved in real estate were punished for their actions. In 2009, programs like HARP, HAMP, and modifications were introduced to protect homeowners. These actions helped stop the unfair practices and made things right for consumers."}], "output": "\n4,000.**"},

They believed in different forms of socialism. After the 1917 February Revolution, they worked with other groups to form the Russian Provisional Government. In November 1917, they got the most votes in the first democratic election but things changed with the October Revolution. The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, stopped the Constituent Assembly and caused a split within the SRs. The pro-Bolshevik faction, called the Right SRs, supported Kerensky but lost in the Civil War and faced persecution from the Bolsheviks. \nThe Russian Civil War happened right after the Russian Revolutions in 1917. Many groups fought to decide Russia's future. The main groups were the Red Army, led by Vladimir Lenin for socialism, and the White Army, which had different beliefs like monarchy, capitalism, and other forms of socialism. Some other groups also fought. Foreign countries like the Allies and pro-German armies helped the White Army. The Red Army won most of the battles by 1919, and the White forces were defeated in Crimea by 1920. Fighting continued in some areas until 1923, but Red control of the Soviet Union was solid by then. The war caused a huge number of deaths, mostly among civilians, and is considered one of the worst disasters in Europe's history.\nRussia's communism started when Tsar Nicholas II lost control during the February Revolution. A new government called the Provisional Government took over with Prince Lvov leading, but the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, disagreed and started a revolution in October 1917. They won control and Lenin ruled from 1917 to 1924. The Bolsheviks created the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, which caused a big fight, called the Russian Civil War, between the Reds (Bolsheviks) and Whites. In 1922, the Reds won and formed the Soviet Union. Lenin passed away in 1924, leading to a power struggle that ended with Joseph Stalin becoming the boss. He stayed in charge until 1953 and was known for causing fear and carrying out a big event called the Great Purge to get rid of people who opposed him. \nLavr Kornilov was a military man in Russia during World War I and the Civil War. He is famous for trying to help the Provisional Government in 1917 but his actions led to him being arrested for trying to overthrow the government. This actually made the Bolshevik party and the soviets stronger. \nAfter the October Revolution, there were fights and protests by other left-wing groups against the Bolsheviks. These groups, like the Socialist Revolutionaries, Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, and anarchists, didn't agree with the Bolsheviks and kept fighting even during and after the Civil War, from 1918 to around 1924. The Bolsheviks tried to include these groups at first, but eventually used force to stop them. \nLouise Bryant was a journalist, activist, and feminist who is famous for her support of Russia and the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. She married writer John Reed and wrote about important Russian figures like Katherine Breshkovsky, Maria Spiridonova, Alexander Kerensky, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky. Her articles, which were published in newspapers in the US and Canada after World War I, were based on her visits to Petrograd and Moscow.

This breed has a history connected to the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terrier. Early on, people brought over terriers and other working dogs from England, and they were bred mostly for their useful skills like hunting and farm work. The breed's ancestors include the Feist, Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, English White Terrier (now extinct), Turnspit dog, and Wry Legged Terrier. To make them better hunters, they were sometimes bred with Beagles or Beagle mixes. This mix of breeds gives the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier a sharp sense of smell, intelligence, and a strong desire to be close to their owners. They can be a bit distant with people they don't know, but they are very loyal and loving companions. \nA Feist is a small hunting dog that was brought to the United States by English miners and other working class people. The dog's ancestors were probably a mix of Smooth Fox Terriers, Manchester Terriers, and a type of dog that's no longer around, the English White Terrier.

He was honored with the Gold Medal of Military Valor after his death.\nThe First Italo-Ethiopian War happened between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896. Italy wanted to control Ethiopia because of a disagreement about a treaty. Germany and Austria, Italy's friends, joined in. Surprisingly, Ethiopia's leader, Menelik II, had support from some of his old enemies. Italy's army, which invaded from Eritrea, faced a stronger Ethiopia than they thought because of this support and help from Russia, a country with similar beliefs. The UK and France also helped Ethiopia to stop Italy from becoming a rival colonizer.\n\nThe fighting started in 1895, and Italy did well at first, but Ethiopia fought back and surrounded an Italian fort called Meqele.

They started in 1916 and have flown many different types of planes, like fighters, bombers, and planes that help with surveillance. During World War I, they fought in Europe. They were stopped in 1919, but came back in 1922 and then again in 1937. They fought as bombers in World War II, Vietnam, and the Malayan Emergency. They stopped using their Canberra planes in 1982 and then started flying Boeing 737 planes for surveillance in 2000. In 2014, one of these planes went to the Middle East to help fight against ISIS. \nThe English Electric Canberra is a British jet-powered bomber that was built in the 1950s. It was created to replace the de Havilland Mosquito during the 1940s because the Air Ministry wanted a faster and more advanced bomber. The Canberra had to be able to fly high and drop bombs accurately from great heights, which is why they used new jet technology.

Because of his mission, there was a time when both Spanish and Ais people got along really well. \nBefore Europeans arrived in Florida, Indigenous peoples had been living there for over 12,000 years. Unfortunately, by the early 18th century, most Florida's original inhabitants were no longer present. Some Apalachee people moved to Louisiana and their descendants still reside there.

An embassy, which is usually located in the capital city, is a type of diplomatic mission where the country's representatives work. Consulates are similar but not located in the capital. A diplomatic mission can also be in a non-capital city and have connections to other countries, so we have both resident (in the capital) and non-resident embassies. \nA diplomatic bag is a special container that helps carry important papers or items between a country's embassy and their home country. It can look like a box, briefcase, or big bag, and usually has a lock or special seal to keep it safe. The most important thing is that it has special rights called diplomatic immunity, which means nobody can open or take it without permission. The bag can only have things meant for official use, and it's often carried by a special person called a diplomatic courier, who also can't be arrested or detained. \nThe Embassy of China in London is the official place where China communicates with the United Kingdom. This embassy is unique because it's the only one China has in the UK, and they also have two smaller offices in Edinburgh and Manchester.

Before that, Congress talked a lot about the issue, and they decided to keep the law the same, just for men. Some lawyers, like Robert L. Goldberg, said this was unfair to women.

They reduced pensions for soldiers by 20-40% and increased civilian pensions by 20%, without talking to the military leaders first.

He wasn't much into discussing religious laws (Halakot), and when he did, it was usually based on what others had said before. Once, he shared a Halakah without saying who said it, and R. Ammi wondered if it was his own creation. Anani often reported others' sayings in the Haggadah but was more inclined to come up with his own interpretations.\n\nFor example, he connected the rules about sacrifices and priestly clothes because he believed both had atoning powers. He said the high priest's mitre represented humility, as it was believed to atone for feeling too important. Anani also talked about God's appearances in the Bible, explaining them in unique ways, like how God could send multiple angels or speak to Job in a powerful storm.\n\nIn short, Anani ben Sason was a creative thinker who interpreted Jewish traditions in his own original way, sometimes drawing on earlier teachings and stories."}], "output": "\nPamela B.

It was made to honor 329 soldiers from the 66th Berkshire Regiment who sadly died during a big war called the Second Anglo-Afghan War between 1878 and 1880. People also call it the Forbury Lion sometimes. \nThe Reading Post, also known as the Reading Evening Post until 2009, was a newspaper about the town of Reading and nearby places in Berkshire, England. It had a lion on the front called the Maiwand Lion, which is a famous symbol at Forbury Gardens. The paper was owned by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd., a part of a bigger company called Trinity Mirror plc.\nThe Kargil War Memorial, also called Vijaypath, is a special building made by the Indian Army in Dras, close to the Tiger Hill. It's about 5 kilometers from the main part of the city and on a road called Srinagar-Leh National Highway 1D. This memorial is to remember the brave soldiers and officers who lost their lives during the 1999 war between India and Pakistan, which became known as the Kargil War. There's a big wall with the names of all the heroes, and on Kargil Vijay Diwas, which is on July 26th, the Prime Minister of India honors them too, at a place called Amar Jawan Jyothi in New Delhi. At the memorial, you can see the mountains the Indian Army took back from Pakistan and even buy souvenirs. They also flew a giant flag, 15 kilograms heavy, to celebrate their 13th victory anniversary. \nThe Devon County War Memorial is a special monument built to remember the people from Devon who fought and died in World War 1. It was made by a famous designer named Sir Edwin Lutyens and is located in Exeter, which is the main town in Devon, England. This memorial is one of 15 similar designs by Lutyens and is unique because it also honors the city's war heroes. \n\nAt first, people wanted to finish building a cloister at Exeter Cathedral for this purpose, but they didn't have enough money. So, they asked Lutyens to make a different kind of memorial, called a War Cross. They picked a spot on the cathedral's green after looking at many places. At the same time, there was a plan for a separate memorial in a different garden. Because the committees didn't work together, Exeter has two war memorials: one by the cathedral and another in Northernhay Gardens. \nThe Manchester Cenotaph is a memorial built by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square, England, to honor soldiers from the First World War and later conflicts. Manchester took longer than most cities to decide on a memorial, only starting in 1922. The committee collected £10,000 quickly but choosing the right spot was difficult. People wanted to put it in Albert Square but that meant moving statues, which artists didn't like. Then, Piccadilly Gardens was considered, but the council chose St Peter's Square because it was easier. There was already a memorial cross there, but they couldn't move it, so the cenotaph was built around it. \nThe York City War Memorial is a memorial from World War 1 designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. It is in York, England. Plans for the memorial started in 1919, but people had different ideas. They first wanted it to be useful, but later decided on a monument. The city engineer gave an estimate, and the committee chose Lutyens, who was also working on a memorial for the North Eastern Railway (NER) in York. Lutyens made a design, but people didn't like how it looked with the old buildings and thought the NER's memorial would be too big. They changed the location and Lutyens made a simpler design, but they couldn't afford the full plan, so they only built a War Cross."}], "output": "\n2009.**"},

He was the son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, who named their clan Clann Domhnaill, a part of Clann Somhairle. Aonghus Mór took over after his father in the middle of the century. At that time, the leaders of the Isles were not very connected to the Scottish government and only gave a small loyalty to the Norwegian king. Aonghus Mór's first known event shows him helping local Irish groups fight against the growing power of the Anglo-Irish in northwest Ireland. This might have been because clans like Clann Domhnaill formed alliances with the Irish to get support against Scottish expansion. \nThe Kingdom of the Isles existed from the 9th to the 13th century and included the Hebrides, islands near the Firth of Clyde, and the Isle of Man. The Norse called these islands the Suðreyjar, meaning Southern Isles, different from the Norðreyjar or Northern Isles in Orkney and Shetland. The history of this kingdom is not well-documented, and it wasn't always a stable entity. The rulers sometimes acted independently, but often answered to overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland, or Orkney. There were also disagreements about who owned what part of the land. The total area of these islands is over 8,300 square kilometers, stretching over 500 kilometers from north to south. Some rulers referred to their kingdom as Mann and the Isles, but not all of them.\nBefore the late 14th century, the leaders of Clann Domhnaill were known as Lords of Islay. Aonghus Mór, the son of Domhnall mac Raghnaill, was one of the first to call himself Lord of Islay. This title was often used by their family members, especially those from Clann Domhnaill. \nHimachal Pradesh has almost 37,691 square kilometers of forests, which is around 38.3% of the entire state.

The main island covers 64,103 square kilometers, which is 94.1% of the state's total land area. The next eleven biggest islands combined take up 3,826 square kilometers, adding up to almost the entire state (99.75%).

The portable kerosene lanterns have a flat wick and come in different versions for different flame control. \nA glow switch starter is a device used with fluorescent lamps to help them start. It has neon or argon gas inside and has a bimetallic strip and a fixed electrode. When electricity flows, the gas heats the strip, making it bend towards the electrode, which connects the lamp.

They advanced to the knockout stage only once, which was in 2014 when they reached the round of 16 but lost to Germany. In 1982, they nearly made it to the second round after winning against West Germany and Chile, but a match between West Germany and Austria prevented them from advancing. In 2014, Algeria achieved a new milestone by qualifying for the round of 16 for the first time. \nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup was a big soccer event where men's national teams played against each other. It happened in Brazil from June 12 to July 13, 2014. Brazil got to host the event because they won the chance in 2007. This was the second time Brazil hosted the World Cup, the first time was in 1950, and it was the fifth time the event took place in South America.\nThe 2015 Cricket World Cup began with exciting opening ceremonies in both New Zealand and Australia. These ceremonies happened right before the big tournament, which was their first time hosting it in 23 years. There were two ceremonies happening at the same time - one in Christchurch, New Zealand at North Hagley Park, and the other in Melbourne, Australia. Many people went to see the ceremonies and it was especially special for Christchurch, as it was the first big sports event after a very sad earthquake in 2011. \nOrvar Bergmark, a Swedish football player and manager, was the second national team manager for Sweden. He led the team to the historic FIFA World Cup in Mexico in 1970 after defeating France in qualifying matches. It was a big achievement because it was Sweden's first World Cup appearance in 12 years, following their hosting in 1958. They hadn't qualified for three previous World Cups: in 1954, 1962, and 1966. \nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup, held from May 31 to June 30, 2002, in South Korea and Japan, marked the first time Asia hosted the event. It was also unique because it wasn't in Europe or the Americas, unlike previous ones. Brazil won the tournament for the fifth time, defeating Germany 2-0. This victory qualified them for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. Turkey, making their second appearance, secured third place by beating South Korea 3-2. Four teams - China PR, Ecuador, Senegal, and Slovenia - made their debut, while Republic of Ireland, Russia, and Sweden returned after a缺席 in 1998. \nThe Rugby World Cup in 1991 was the second one. It was held in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and France because they were part of a big rugby competition called the Five Nations Championship. This was the first time the tournament was held in the northern part of the world, with England playing the main game. People paid more attention to it than the first one in 1987. Because more teams wanted to join, there were new qualifying rounds. In 1987, only eight teams made it to the quarter-finals, but now 33 countries tried. Western Samoa joined instead of Tonga. The format of the tournament stayed the same, but they made a small change to the points system."}], "output": "\nBrazil.**"},

It lasted for a month and caused a lot of destruction, with many civilians losing their lives and the city being almost completely ruined. This was the worst fighting in the Pacific during World War II. The Japanese also hurt a lot of innocent people. After this battle, the Japanese stopped controlling the Philippines. This victory was important for General Douglas MacArthur's plan to take back the country. \nDuring the American Civil War, there was a big fight called the Seven Days Battles. It happened from June 25 to July 1, 1862, close to a place called Richmond, Virginia. Confederate leader Robert E. Lee and his team stopped the Union Army, led by General George B. McClellan, from going near Richmond. The Union Army had to run away towards the Virginia Peninsula. Some people wrongly call this fight the Seven Days Campaign, but it was actually the last part of a bigger plan called the Peninsula Campaign.\nThis paragraph explains that it lists the Confederate Army units and their leaders who participated in the Seven Days Battles between June 25 and July 1, 1862, during the American Civil War. The information is based on the army's structure at the time, records of casualties, and battle reports, with a separate list for the Union army. \nThis paragraph is about the groups of soldiers and their leaders from the Union Army who fought in a big battle called the Seven Days Battles from June 25 to July 1, 1862, during the American Civil War. It talks about organizing their positions and includes information from reports about what happened during the battle. The list for the Confederate soldiers is in a different part. \nThe Battle of Cross Keys, which took place on June 8, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, was a significant part of Confederate General Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War. This battle, along with the one at Port Republic the next day, were crucial wins for Jackson's Valley Campaign. These victories made the Union armies retreat and allowed Jackson to strengthen General Robert E. Lee's forces for the battles around Richmond, Virginia. \nThe Battle of Gaines's Mill, also called the First Battle of Cold Harbor or the Chickahominy River battle, was a big event during the American Civil War on June 27, 1862. After a close but not decisive battle the day before, Confederate General Robert E. Lee wanted to attack the Union Army's right side, which was alone near the Chickahominy River. Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's group had set up a strong defense near Boatswain's Swamp. Lee had a huge army of around 57,000 people, and they attacked Porter's group in a messy way. The Union troops fought hard, especially when the Confederate leaders A.P. Hill and Richard S. Ewell attacked, causing many losses. But Stonewall Jackson's troops didn't arrive on time, so Porter got some help from the VI Corps before the full Confederate force could be brought together."}], "output": "\nSeven Days Battles**"},

Imagine it like this: if the first chord is G Major and the second one is E minor, you can add a third chord in between to make the bass move step by step. For instance, you can use G-D/F# then E minor (G-E). The cool part is that sometimes the third note of the second chord, like F# in this case, is played in the bass. This technique can be done by different musicians, like upright bass players, electric bassists, guitarists, or even piano players.

People first thought they were bones from a meat-eating dinosaur. There's a special find called NMMNH P-18400, which includes a shin bone, backbone pieces, and some smaller bits. These fossils came from an area called Bluewater Creek, close to Fort Wingate. Andrew Heckert suggested a name for them, but it didn't stick.

There are three known species: S. goodwini from New Mexico, S. buchholtzae from Montana, and S. edmontonense from Alberta. The name comes from Greek words for ball and dome because of their dome-shaped skull. These dinosaurs lived for about 7-8 million years and were widespread. Sphaerotholus is unique because it has a special bone feature that sets it apart from other pachycephalosaurids. It's considered a highly evolved species within its group. \nOryctodromeus was a tiny dinosaur that belonged to the Thescelosauridae family, which were known for running fast and eating plants.

The bones, discovered in the Bull Canyon Formation during the Norian age of the Upper Triassic, include parts of the spine, pelvis, and thigh bones. Adrian Hunt suggested calling it Cryptoraptor lockleyi in his research, but this name didn't gain acceptance. The bones were first mentioned scientifically in 2007 when researchers re-examined Late Triassic North American fossils thought to be from dinosaurs, but they could only classify them as part of the group called Archosauria."}], "output": "\nDinosaur.**"},

They were Celts, and we know about them because we found some inscriptions that date back to the 4th century.\nThe culture that developed in Britain after the Romans conquered in 43 AD and named it Britannia was called Romano-British. It mixed Roman and local Celtic influences. Even after the Romans left in the 5th century, this culture continued.

Some Frisian settlers in Southern Jutland also spoke it, but there are no known texts from that area. The language of the original inhabitants in the region around the Zuiderzee and Ems River, as mentioned by Tacitus, is only found in a few personal names and place names. Over time, Old Frisian developed into Middle Frisian, spoken from the 16th to the 19th century. \nThe Leda is a river in northwest Germany, specifically in Lower Saxony.

He wrote it in 1967 when he was in the Beatles. The song came after Paul McCartney said he took LSD, which caused a big fuss in the media. It's like when John Lennon said the Beatles were more important than religion. See Yourself talks about being self-aware and thinking about how your actions affect others. It has a unique music style with different time signatures, like 4/4 and 9/8. The lyrics also remember the ideas from Beatles songs like Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love from that time. \nWithin You Without You is a song by George Harrison from the Beatles' 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It's about his time in India learning from his teacher Ravi Shankar in 1966. The song has Indian instruments like the sitar, dilruba, and tabla.

She co-founded Jivamukti Yoga with David Life, which became popular in the western world during the late 20th century. This yoga method focuses on finding enlightenment by showing love and care for all living beings, including animals and nature, and challenges the idea of exploiting them.\n\nJivamukti Yoga teaches that to reach happiness, one must be kind to all without exception. One of its key practices is a vegan diet, as it causes minimal harm to the environment and others, including humans. The concept of shunyata or emptiness, from ancient yogic texts, is central to the practice. It suggests that our perception shapes our reality, so to change the world, we must first change our own views and stop blaming others.\n\nGannon believes that our actions towards others determine how we are treated, which in turn influences how we see ourselves, shaping our identity. \nSyd Barrett, a founding member of Pink Floyd and a key contributor to their early success, wrote many songs for their first two albums, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets.

Barrett then released two solo albums in 1970 but eventually left the music industry in 1972. \nAfter David Bowie's death, an album called No Plan was released on January 8, 2017.

The insurance company should decide if the offer is reasonable, not if their policy covers it. They must also keep the policyholder informed about settlement offers. If the insurance company forces the policyholder to contribute to a settlement unfairly, they can be held liable. \nMana Al Otaiba, born on May 15, 1946, in Abu Dhabi, UAE, to Saeed Al Otaiba, had a career as the former Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources under Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.

It began when Peter Aylen, a significant Irish timber operator, formed a group called the Shiners. Their purpose was to attack other timber businesses, specifically those belonging to French Canadians.

Starting in the 1600s, they faced challenges from outside forces like the Dutch, Spanish, and Han Chinese. These challenges led to them losing their own language and culture, and by the late 1800s, they mostly assimilated with the Han Chinese. Now, they are a nearly invisible group in a society mainly controlled by the Han Chinese. During Japan's rule, Japanese scholars studied these tribes using science, and their research helped shape how we categorize the Plains tribes today. \nAfrican Bermudians, or those with African roots, are a group of people in Bermuda.

The name Marsilea comes from an Italian scientist named Luigi Ferdinando Marsili, who lived from 1656 to 1730. \nBrabejum is a type of large evergreen tree native to the Western Cape Province in South Africa. It's commonly known as wild almond, bitter almond, or gheeboontjie. This tree belongs to the Proteaceae family and is unique to Africa within the grevilleoid subfamily. It has a bushy structure with branches close to the ground and many strong stems. The leaves are narrow, have blunt teeth, and grow in groups of six. In summer, it produces white flowers in clusters from reddish buds near the leaf bases.

The first time someone officially described this plant was in 1776 by two German botanists, but it took until 1979 to clearly define the different species.

This one is small and has really long legs, which means it could walk upright. It also had different kinds of teeth, which might mean it ate both plants and animals. Its thin legs and how they were positioned show that it spent most of its time on land, not in the water like modern crocodiles and alligators. So, Araripesuchus wegeneri is quite different from its modern-day cousins."}], "output": "\nMarsilea.**"},

Boren or United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.? \n\n Passage: \nThe Paramount Pictures case in 1948, also called the Hollywood Antitrust Case, was a big court ruling that said movie studios couldn't own theaters and force them to only show their films. This decision affected how movies were made, distributed, and shown in theaters. The court said this kind of exclusive deal was against the antitrust laws in the US. \nIn the 1976 case of Craig v. Boren, the Supreme Court ruled for the first time that when a government makes rules based on gender, those rules have to meet a certain level of scrutiny to make sure they're fair under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This means that sex-based classifications in laws or policies need to be carefully examined to ensure they don't discriminate unfairly.\nBlock booking is a way movie studios sell several films to a theater as a package. This was common in Hollywood during the 1930s until it was banned in 1948. With block booking, theater owners had to buy a lot of movies from a studio without knowing what they were. Studios would include both popular movies with famous actors and less popular ones. This helped studios save money on making and showing movies, and the part where owners bid on unseen movies is called blind bidding. \nIn 1971, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that a law saying marriage can only be between a man and a woman was constitutional. Richard Baker, who didn't agree, tried to appeal to the US Supreme Court. But on October 10, 1972, they didn't want to hear the case because there wasn't a big enough issue. This decision, Baker v. Nelson, became a legal precedent. In 2013, Minnesota allowed same-sex marriage, and in 2015, the US Supreme Court said Baker's case was wrong in a new ruling called Obergefell v. Hodges, making same-sex marriage legal everywhere in the US. \nThe R v Van der Peet case in 1996 is important for understanding Aboriginal rights according to Section 35 of the Constitution Act. The court ruled that Native people don't have the right to sell fish for profit from their fishing activities. This判决形成了Van der Peet test, a method to decide if an Aboriginal right exists.

They played at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. During that time, MLS didn't allow games to end in ties, so they used shootouts to settle draws. However, when looking at their stats, shootouts are not included, which is why their regular season point total appears to be 63 instead of the actual 49 points they earned. A shootout victory was worth 2 points, and a loss was worth 0 points. \nIn the 1999 Kansas City Wizards soccer team's season, they played at Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri. Since the league didn't allow ties, they used shootouts to decide between tied games. The stats don't count shootout goals, so even though their regular season points should have been 20, it's shown as 24. If a shootout ended in a win, the team got 2 points, and 0 points for a loss. Their manager, Ron Newman, was replaced by Bob Gansler during that time. \nIn 2004, the ninth championship game of Major League Soccer, called MLS Cup, happened between two teams, D.C.

He was born on July 20, 1953.\nIntroduction to Metaphysics is a 1903 essay by Henri Bergson. He talks about reality not as separate parts, but like a flowing process, similar to ideas from process philosophy or Greek philosopher Heraclitus. Bergson believes reality is too complex to understand fully by breaking it down into tiny pieces. Instead, he thinks we can truly grasp reality by using our intuition, which means connecting with it on a deeper level, like 'entering' the object. \nDuration, as explained by French philosopher Henri Bergson, is a concept he developed to understand time and consciousness better. Bergson believed that Herbert Spencer's ideas were incomplete because Spencer didn't fully grasp mechanics. Bergson felt that time is something that can't be measured or explained by math or science, because when we try to measure it, it's already gone. Time can seem to move faster or slower for each person, but for scientists, it remains constant.\n\nBergson focused on the personal experience of time, which he called duration. This is a unique, unquantifiable aspect of our lives that cannot be fully described or captured by words or images. To understand duration, one must use their imagination to grasp it intuitively, as it's something that can only be felt, not fully explained. \nSamuel Eliot Morison was a well-known American historian who specialized in maritime and American history.

Morison authored the popular Oxford History of the American People and co-wrote The Growth of the American Republic with Henry Steele Commager.

It was made up of old kingdoms called Mide, Osraige, and Leinster. A long time ago, in the 12th century, when people from Norman invaded Ireland, the areas of Leinster and Mide started to join together because of something called the Pale, which was in both places. This joining made the modern-day Leinster province. To manage and make decisions, these ancient kingdoms were divided into smaller areas called counties. Over time, more changes were made to these counties through local rules. \nPatrick Kennedy was a bookseller from Wexford, Ireland, born around 1801. He became famous for collecting and preserving Irish folktales, especially those from Leinster. His stories were told in a simple English style that reflected the language of Irish farmers who lived in the anglicized part of the country, known as The Pale.

He falls in love with Juliet, who is from a different family called the Capulets. They get married secretly. Because Romeo kills Juliet's cousin in a fight, he has to leave town. He sadly ends his life after thinking Juliet is dead, but she was not. \nBenvolio is a character in the play Romeo and Juliet. He is related to both Romeo and Montague - Romeo's cousin and Montague's nephew. In the story, Benvolio tries to stop the fighting between the Capulet and Montague families, but unfortunately, he isn't successful.\nHamlet is the main character in Shakespeare's play Hamlet. He is the prince of Denmark and wants to avenge his father's murder by Claudius, who took over the throne. Hamlet is confused and questioning his own mind throughout the story. In the end, he ends up causing the deaths of many people, including his father's enemies, two friends, his girlfriend Ophelia, and even his own mother, who died accidentally. \nMacbeth is a play by William Shakespeare, first acted in 1606. The story shows how political greed can harm people emotionally and physically. This play best represents Shakespeare's relationship with King James I, who supported his theater group. Macbeth was later printed in 1623 and is the shortest tragedy written by Shakespeare. \nRevenge tragedy, also known as revenge dramas or tragedies of blood, were popular plays in early modern England. Ashley H. Thorndike defined this genre in 1902, explaining that revenge tragedies are focused on revenge as the main motive and involve the pursuit of revenge, often resulting in the deaths of the murderers and sometimes the avenger. The Spanish Tragedy by Thomas Kyd (1580s) is often seen as the first example, but research now suggests that revenge tragedies existed even earlier, around 1560, with plays like Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca's works and Gorbuduc by Thomases Norton and Sackville. Shakespeare's Hamlet (1599-1602), Titus Andronicus (1588-1593), and Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy (1606) are also well-known examples of this genre. \nShakespearean tragedy refers to the majority of tragic plays written by William Shakespeare. Although some of his historical plays are considered tragedies due to their tragic elements, they are classified as histories because they are based on real events in English history. On the other hand, plays like Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus, which have historical settings but foreign sources, are mostly categorized as tragedies. Later in his career, Shakespeare wrote tragicomic plays, a mix of tragedy and comedy, with a tragic hero but a happy ending, similar to his comedies. Scholar F.S. Boas introduced the concept of problem plays, which don't fit neatly into either tragedy or comedy, due to their unique themes, settings, or endings. Even today, experts sometimes argue about how to classify certain of Shakespeare's plays."}], "output": "\nRomeo Montague.**"},

They help in growing tissues, especially muscles, and are in the same group as hormones like estrogen and progesterone. The word anabolic comes from the Greek meaning to build up. \nAnabolic steroids, which come from the male hormone testosterone, are used to help build muscles and increase strength. People use them for looks and to perform better in sports and bodybuilding. These drugs make muscles grow faster than natural workouts. Teenagers and adults often use them because they speed up muscle growth.\nDocking is when someone cuts off the tail or sometimes even the ears of an animal. We usually call it cropping for ears and docking for tails, but sometimes people also use tailing. The word comes from dock, which means the part of the tail where the hairs grow. \nTensile testing is a crucial materials science test where a material is pulled until it breaks. This test helps choose the right material for different uses, checks its quality, and predicts how it will behave under normal forces. By measuring things like how much it stretches (ultimate tensile strength), how much it changes in size (maximum elongation), and how much it gets thinner (reduction in area), we can learn about other properties like Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, and how the material gets harder to stretch (strain-hardening). For most simple materials, uniaxial testing is enough, but for more complex ones like composites and textiles, biaxial testing is needed. \nSTOLports were special airports built for planes that need short runways, like those with small engines. They were popular in the 80s when London City airport had restrictions. These airports had short runways, usually less than 5000 feet, and could only handle certain types of planes, usually smaller ones with limited fuel. In the US, they just call these short runway airports, and the term STOLport isn't used much anymore. \nTrickle valves, also called vacuum valves, are used in factories to keep a dust collector's bottom clean while letting out the collected dust. They are cheaper than other types of airlocks. Trickle valves don't need electricity to work, which is good for machines like trenchers that need a dust-free space for smooth operation. They were made for this exact job."}], "output": "\nAnabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) are commonly used in bodybuilding.**"},

It's originally from Madagascar and Africa. This plant belongs to the dogbane family, which is called Apocynaceae. The name Pachypodium comes from Greek words that mean thick-footed because it has a thick base or root. \nStenocereus is a type of tall, skinny cactus that grows in places like Mexico, Arizona, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Venezuela, and some Dutch islands. It's related to the unique chinoa or chende cactus called Polaskia chende. Sometimes, other cactus species are added to this group too.\nCoprosma repens is a type of flowering plant that can grow into a shrub or a small tree. It belongs to the family Rubiaceae and is native to New Zealand. You might also know it by other names such as tree bedstraw, taupata, mirror bush, looking-glass bush, New Zealand laurel, or shiny leaf. \nNitrogen assimilation is the process by which living things, such as plants, fungi, and certain bacteria, convert inorganic nitrogen compounds found in the environment into useful organic compounds like amino acids. Those that can't convert nitrogen gas (N) directly, like plants and fungi, rely on taking in nitrate or ammonia.

A creeper, like a big snake, wraps around it tightly, but the tree is so tough it can handle it. The creeper has pretty red flowers that look like a colorful scarf on the tree. At night, the garden is alive with the sound of a nightingale's song. In winter, a baboon family plays in the tree while watching the sunrise. The tree is special to the poet because it brings back happy memories with her siblings, and she wants to remember it always. She compares her love for the tree to Wordsworth's love for the Yew trees. The poet hopes that her poem will keep the memory of the Casuarina Tree alive, even after she's gone."}], "output": "\nNo, Stenocereus does not include tree-like plants, as it is a cactus that grows tall and skinny.

There's a Goat on the Roof in 1966. \nPoleconomy is a fun board game created by Bruce E. Hatherley from New Zealand in 1980. It's similar to Monopoly, but instead of properties, the game has companies. Players work together to collect companies, investments, and learn about basic economics and how the government affects it. The game has a fixed time, like 2 hours, and the winner is the one with the most money, assets, or when there are no more companies, bank items, or treasury bonds left. It's designed to teach players about economics and how it connects to politics. Different versions were made for different countries, and Poleconomy combines the words politics and economy.\nPashmina is a special kind of soft and fine wool that comes from goats. It was first made into pretty clothes in a place called Kashmir in India. The word Pashmina comes from a language called Persian and means soft gold in the local language. These shawls are so thin that they can go through a ring the size of your finger! People in Europe first learned about this special wool in Kashmir, so they called it 'cashmere'. There are four types of goats that give us Pashmina wool: Changthangi from a high place in Kashmir, Malra from another part of Kashmir, Chegu from a northern area in India and Pakistan, and Chyangara from Nepal. These shawls are made by hand in Kashmir and Nepal using very fine cashmere fiber. \nVerão Vermelho is a song by the famous musician Santana, from his album Festival. He pays respect to Brazilian singer Elis Regina. The song has a beautiful acoustic guitar part with The Waters Family, a group of three sisters (Julia, Oren, and Maxine Willard Waters), singing the catchy but simple phrase Badadup, badadup. It has a fun drumbeat and maracas. During the beginning and end, Santana plays a special flamenco guitar solo, something new for him. There's also a cool keyboard touch by Tom Coster during the song's ending part. \nThe Ford flathead V8 is a type of V8 engine designed by Ford and used in many cars and trucks. When it first came out in 1932, it was special because it made 8-cylinder engines and V engines affordable for regular people. This engine was important for Ford and helped them become a big player in the car market. It stayed popular for 21 years, longer than the Ford Model T engine. It's still well-known today, especially among people who like classic cars and hot rodders. \n Friendship Hall is an old, brick house in East New Market, Maryland. It has a pretty design from the Georgian era. The main part is a big two-story building with five rooms, and there's a smaller one-story section and a single-story kitchen area too. There's also a tall, wooden smokehouse with a special roof on the property. The Sulivane family, an important local family, lived here a long time ago, in 1695."}], "output": "\nHey Pa!

The town has about 8,211 people living there and is located where two big highways, I-77 and I-81, meet. This makes it a popular spot for travelers. During the Civil War, Wytheville was very important and was attacked twice. It's also where Edith Bolling Wilson, who was married to President Woodrow Wilson, was born. \nInterstate 81 (I-81) is an 855-mile highway. In Virginia, it stretches for 324.92 miles, which is the longest part of the route in any state. This highway starts at the Tennessee border near Bristol and ends at the West Virginia border near Winchester.\nInterstate 40 (I-40) is a highway that goes from Barstow, California to Wilmington, North Carolina. In North Carolina, it starts near the Pigeon River Gorge and comes from Tennessee. This highway goes through many cities like Asheville, Winston-Salem, Greensboro, Durham, and Raleigh before ending in Wilmington. It passes through different landscapes like the Blue Ridge Mountains, hills, suburban areas, city centers, and farmland in eastern North Carolina. I-40 is the longest highway in North Carolina at 423.55 miles. There are also some smaller highways connected to it and a business loop in Winston-Salem. Even though the number 40 suggests an east-west direction, the part from Hillsboro to Wilmington mostly follows a north-south path. \nIn New York, there are 32 Interstate Highways, which are mainly divided into 9 main routes and 23 additional ones. The state's Department of Transportation, NYSDOT, takes care of most of these highways, but they use a different naming system. Instead of calling them directly by their number, they add the letter I after it. This helps to differentiate between the Interstates (like I-86) and regular state routes (like NY-86) without confusion. Sometimes, the numbers might look the same, but the I makes it clear which is which. \nIn Illinois, the Interstate Highways are part of a big road system run by the state. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) takes care of these highways. There are 13 main roads and 11 extra roads that together cover 2,248.93 miles. The longest highway is Interstate 57, which is 358.57 miles, and the shortest is Interstate 41, which is just 0.90 miles long. \nThis paragraph provides a list of 16 highways in Maryland that are part of the Interstate system. Six are main roads (primary) and ten are helper roads connected to the primaries. The longest main road is I-95, which is 110.01 miles long, and the shortest is I-81 at 12.08 miles. I-97 is the shortest main road and shortest within the state, standing at 17.62 miles. It's unique because it's entirely in one county and doesn't connect to other main roads. The longest helper road is I-695 (51.48 miles) and the shortest is I-295 (0.80 miles). The Maryland State Highway Administration maintains all Interstates except for specific segments of I-395, I-895, a part of I-695, the Baltimore area of I-95 and I-83. There's one unsigned Interstate called I-595, which is marked as US Route 50 and US 301. Lastly, I-170 used to be an Interstate but is now marked in gray."}], "output": "\n8,211 people.**"},

This was the second time Britain invaded Afghanistan. The British won and made the Afghans agree to their demands through the Treaty of Gandamak. After this, most British and Indian soldiers left, but the Afghans kept control of their own affairs with some rules from the British. The British wanted Afghanistan to stay free from other countries controlling it, acting as a shield between them and the Russian Empire.\nThe Emirate of Afghanistan, located between Central Asia and South Asia, existed before the current Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. It began when Dost Mohammed Khan, founder of the Barakzai dynasty, gained power. The emirate was heavily influenced by the conflict, known as 'the Great Game,' between Russia and the United Kingdom for control in Central Asia. At the same time, European powers expanded their influence in South Asia. Afghanistan fought against the Sikh Empire, leading to a British invasion in 1842. Although the British won, they didn't achieve their initial goals.

It can work based on different cycles, like those by Sir George Cayley, John Ericsson, and Robert Stirling. These engines are different from internal combustion engines and steam engines. \nSir George Cayley, a famous English engineer, is a key figure in the history of aeronautics.

He first made one in 1919 and later improved it in 1933. These engines are special types called external combustion engines that use air or other gases like helium or hydrogen as a working fluid. They have valves and work with a single-phase gas inside. \nCharles Stephen Boreham was a shearer and trade unionist from New Zealand. He was born on December 19, 1857, in Richmond, Tasmania, which is in Australia. \nA gas-generator cycle is a type of rocket engine that uses both fuels. Some of the fuel is burned to create hot gas, which powers the engine's pumps. After that, the gas is released out. This engine gets its name because it loses some materials, making it an open cycle engine. \nAn external combustion engine is a type of engine where the fuel is burned outside the engine and the heat is transferred to a fluid inside.

The book came out in 1928. In his article, Freud points out that many famous stories, like Oedipus Rex, Hamlet, and The Brothers Karamazov, involve a son killing his father. He even connects this theme in Dostoevsky's work to the author's epilepsy. \nOedipus Rex, also known as Oedipus the King, is a famous play by Sophocles. It was first performed a long, long time ago, around 429 BC. At that time, people just called it Oedipus. Later, they added Tyrant to the title to tell it apart from another play called Oedipus at Colonus. In ancient times, tyrant meant a leader, not necessarily a bad guy.\nSigmund Freud wrote a book called The Interpretation of Dreams in 1899. In it, he talked about how our unconscious mind affects our dreams and introduced the idea of the Oedipus complex.

Freud considered this kind of understanding a rare achievement. \nPeter Gay's biography of Sigmund Freud, titled Freud: A Life for Our Time, was released in 1988.

She was celebrated for her exceptional interpretations of Catalan, Spanish, and Latin American art songs from the 20th century. Many composers, like Enrique Granados, Manuel de Falla, Frederic Mompou, Alberto Ginastera, and Enric Morera, created special pieces just for her voice.

It likes to live in the forest near the ground and comes out after it rains in the afternoon, usually in the early evening. The name comes from a character in a famous book called The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. \nJ. R. R. Tolkien, an English author and scholar, wrote a famous book called The Lord of the Rings. It's a big fantasy story that started as a follow-up to his 1937 book The Hobbit. Over time, it grew much bigger. Tolkien wrote it in bits and pieces between 1937 and 1949, and it has sold more than 150 million copies, making it one of the best-selling books ever.\nSuanfa Tongzong, a math book from the 1500s by Cheng Dawei, focuses on basic calculations for the abacus. It has 595 problems in 17 chapters and was crucial for understanding math in China's tradition. In 1598, Cheng published another book, Suanfa Zuanyao, which mostly copied four chapters from the first one. When Suanfa Tongzong sold well, it caused a rise in paper prices and led to fake copies with mistakes. To stop this, Cheng made a shorter version. \nGollum is a character from J.R.R. Tolkien's stories. He first appeared in The Hobbit in 1937 and later played a big role in The Lord of the Rings. Gollum was a Hobbit from the River-folk, living near Gladden Fields. His name used to be Sméagol, but he became Gollum because he made a scary gurgling sound. \nAnthony Aguirre and Max Tegmark suggest a way to understand quantum mechanics in a universe that keeps expanding forever, making it huge with countless planets and many copies of everything. In this view, the quantum state of a system means all the real, identical copies of it existing in this big space. We don't need to worry about the wavefunction collapsing, and the uncertainty we feel is because we can't tell which copy of ourselves is experiencing things. \nAndy Serkis initially agreed to do a three-week voice-over for Gollum in The Lord of the Rings, but it turned into a much bigger project that took five years. He devoted a lot of effort to bring Gollum to life, even incorporating details like Gollum's distinctive cough. The book also talks about the challenges of combining live-action with computer-generated imagery (CGI) and the debate over whether Serkis should have received an Academy Award for his portrayal."}], "output": "\n150 million.**"},

Gibb or Reynolds v. Sims? \n\n Passage: \nReynolds v. Sims (1964) was a Supreme Court case. It said that when people in a state choose their legislature, all districts should have about the same number of people. This rule was made because it was unfair for rural areas to have less power than big cities. A man named M.O. Sims from Birmingham, Alabama, sued on behalf of Alabama voters. But this decision affected other states too, especially those in the north and south, who didn't adjust their legislature based on population changes. It happened because similar cases were also decided in Colorado, New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware. \nIn the 1984 case Selle v. Gibb, the Seventh Circuit Court ruled that if there's no proof of copying through access (like having access to someone else's work) and the similarity between two works is so strong it's hard to believe they were created independently, without influence, or from a common source, it might suggest copying. However, just striking similarity isn't enough; it must be so unlikely that it points to copying, not just coincidence or a shared source.\nWest v. Barnes, decided in 1791, was the first case where the US Supreme Court required oral arguments. Prior to this, Van Staphorst v. Maryland was scheduled but settled before the Court could hear it. West was argued on August 2, 1791 and ruled on August 3. Collet v. Collet, another 1791 case, was initially listed for the Court but was dropped before it could proceed. The full opinions in West v. Barnes were not published by Supreme Court Reporter Alexander Dallas but were shared in newspapers. He did publish a summary of the decisions. \nThe Reynolds v Times Newspapers Ltd case was a significant ruling in English defamation law. It dealt with the issue of whether newspapers can publish defamatory statements about individuals if it's in the public interest. The case focused on the concept of qualified privilege, which protects publishers to some extent. \nGeorge Reynolds was a significant leader in the LDS Church, serving as a secretary to the top leadership. He also played a key role in a famous court case called Reynolds v. United States in 1878, which was the first time the US Supreme Court dealt with religious freedom. Reynolds lived from 1842 to 1909. \nJameel v Wall Street Journal Europe was a court ruling by the House of Lords about defamation laws in England.

It's about 40 miles west of Boston, 50 miles east of Springfield, and 40 miles north of Providence. Because it's in the middle of the state, people call it the Heart of the Commonwealth, and that's why a heart is the symbol of the city. Some say the heart symbol might come from the story that Valentine's Day cards were first made there.\nThe Sutliff Bridge is a special old bridge in a place called Sutliff in Iowa. It was built a long time ago in 1897 and 1898 by a company named Parker. People liked it so much that it became a famous spot, even for a fun race called the worst road race. But in 2008, big floods destroyed part of it. Now, they're fixing it and it will cost about $1.7 million. The government and people are helping to pay for it. In 2012, they opened the fixed bridge again after four years. \nThe Gardnerville Branch Jail is an old jail in Gardnerville, Nevada. It was built in 1910 to replace a small jail in Genoa, which was the county seat at the time. People in Gardnerville needed a better jail because the granary where they kept prisoners wasn't suitable. They asked the county to build a new one, but some leaders in Minden didn't want Gardnerville to become the new county seat, so they made a fuss. Despite the opposition, the jail was built and used to hold prisoners until 1915 when Minden got its own jail because it became the county seat. \nThe Cerro Gordo County Courthouse is in Mason City, Iowa. When the county was made in 1855, Mason City became the main town. But some people in the west of the county didn't like it, so they asked the state to move the county seat to Livonia and built a courthouse there. Many people in the county wanted it back in Mason City, and they won in 1858. Before the current modern building, which the county uses now, there were two courthouses in Mason City. The current one used to be the Standard Oil Building. The county bought it in 1959 for $159,400 and changed it to fit their needs. \nThe Old Allamakee County Courthouse in Lansing, Iowa, was a courthouse that didn't last long. It was built in 1861 because there was a disagreement between Lansing and Waukon about which town should be the county seat. Lansing had lost before but won again in 1861 with help from Columbus. Waukon built its own courthouse but didn't get to be the seat again in 1864. In 1866, a Waukon sheriff tried to take the county records, but people from Lansing stopped him. The Iowa Supreme Court finally said Waukon was the county seat in 1867, and that's where it is now."}], "output": "\nWorcester County.**"},

Farrell or Louis Aragon, wrote of the political and human consequences of his country's colonial rule? \n\n Passage: \nJames Gordon Farrell was a Liverpool-born writer of Irish origin, famous for his 'Empire Trilogy' (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur, and The Singapore Grip). These novels explore the impact of British colonial rule on both politics and people. \nLouis Aragon was a French poet known for being a key figure in the surrealist movement in France. Along with André Breton and Philippe Soupault, he started a famous literary magazine called Littérature. He also wrote novels, worked as an editor, was a member of the Communist Party, and had the honor of being part of the Académie Goncourt.\nThe Murree Rebellion in 1857, also called a war for independence, was a small battle between local tribes in the town of Murree (in today's Pakistan) and the British government in India. People had been unhappy with British control for many years. There were some smaller fights before, but in 1857, the rebellion felt like a bigger deal because people really believed it might end British rule. \nNiger's Constitution from 1999 states that it supports most human rights, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, there are still issues with the government, military, and police, and some traditional practices go against the constitution. In the past, when Niger was under French control and after independence until 1992, people had very few rights and the government was unpredictable. Although things have improved since the country started having civilian leaders, people are still concerned about human rights in Niger. \nIn 1985, Hong Kong made its first change to how leaders were chosen for the local government. This happened when Britain still ruled Hong Kong. They introduced indirect elections in a paper called Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong before an important agreement in December. This change helped start a system of democracy in Hong Kong, which continued until the handover to China in 1997 and continued to grow after that. \nLéo Ferré's album Les Chansons d'Aragon, released in 1961 by Barclay Records, is his second album inspired by a poet. The first one was about Baudelaire in 1957.

He was one of the pioneers in introducing Scandinavian design to the United States. He was born on May 8, 1916, and passed away on December 9, 2016. \nScandinavian design is a style that became popular in the 1950s in Finland, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, and Denmark. It's known for being simple, having minimal decorations, and being very practical. Even though the term Scandinavia usually means Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, people sometimes use it to include all five countries when talking about this design style.\nIn 2003, Charles Lim Chee Pang, the founder of Peliontech, introduced a new type of ERP software called Workflow Resource Planning (WRP) to replace traditional ERP systems. These systems typically work by entering data and processing it. Lim's innovation was to create WRP software, like Radix ERP, which includes workflow features right from the start. Although workflow systems were once popular with Lotus Notes, they fell out of favor around 2000. Lim took inspiration from Lotus Notes and combined workflow capabilities into ERP systems, resulting in a new category of ERP called Radix WRP, designed to manage workflows more effectively. \nAn NTFS symbolic link is a file in the NTFS system that points to another file or folder. It acts like a regular file or directory and can be treated the same way by users and programs. Starting with NTFS 3.0 in Windows 2000, you could create links to directories (junction points) and entire volumes (mount points). From NTFS 3.1, which came with Windows XP, symbolic links could be used for any file. However, at first, only special software (filter drivers) like Masatoshi Kimura's open-source codice_1 driver allowed users to create these links in regular programs. In Windows Vista, the ntfs.sys system allowed this feature to be used by default by regular user mode applications. \nJens Ritter Instruments is a company that makes fancy electric guitars and basses. It was started by Jens Ritter in the 1990s, and he used to just make bass guitars but added guitars later. He makes around 50 to 60 unique instruments each year in a small town called Deidesheim in Germany. Many famous bass players use his guitars, like Phil Lesh, Josh Dunham, and Doug Wimbish. Jens Ritter Instruments are special because of their cool design, looks, and because there aren't many of them. They also make strings and other stuff for musicians. \nBio-inspired robotic locomotion is a recent field that uses ideas from nature to create advanced robots. It focuses on designing machines based on biological systems, like how animals move. While biomimicry means copying nature directly, bio-inspired design learns from nature to make simpler and better technology. This has led to soft robotics, which uses flexible materials inspired by living things. Bio-inspired robots study nature's efficient mechanisms to solve engineering problems, often using parts like sensors, actuators, or special materials. The goal is to make robots that can move like animals, and this article explains different ways animals move and some examples of bio-inspired robots based on those movements."}], "output": "\nMid-Century modern furniture.**"},

Our eyes see blue when we look at light with a wavelength between 450 and 495 nanometers. The bluer the light, the shorter its wavelength and closer it is to violet. On the other hand, longer wavelengths make blue appear more green. There's a specific shade of pure blue with a wavelength of 470 nanometers. In art and color theory, blue is considered one of the primary colors, along with red and yellow. Mixing red and blue creates violet, while blue and yellow mix to form green. In the technology world, blue is a primary color too, used in the RGB color model for computer screens and televisions to produce all the colors. \nInnocent Records was a special pop music label made by EMI's Virgin Records to work with their artists who liked pop music more. After the Spice Girls became very popular, Virgin Records wanted to focus on pop music too. They brought Hugh Goldsmith from RCA, who helped Take That become very successful, to start his own part of Virgin Records. He signed Billie Piper and Martine McCutcheon, plus some dance groups like Todd Terry. The label kept doing well until the mid-2000s, with artists like Atomic Kitten and Blue selling lots of records.\nProPhoto RGB is a special color space created by Kodak for photography. It has a very wide range of colors, almost 90% of all possible colors and all commonly seen real-world colors. It's even bigger than other wide-gamut color spaces. The choice of colors helps with color accuracy when adjusting images. However, there's a downside - about 13% of the colors are not real and can't be seen. \nThe YCoCg color model is a type that simplifies an RGB color space by turning it into three parts: Y (luma), Cg (chrominance green), and Co (chrominance orange). It's widely used in video and image compression systems like H.264, HEVC, JPEG XR, and Dirac because it's easy to calculate, gives good results during compression, and can be converted to and from RGB with fewer data requirements compared to other color models. \nA color space is a way to organize and represent colors, whether on paper or digitally. It helps ensure that colors look the same every time they're reproduced. Color spaces can be simple, like Pantone with specific colors and names, or complex, like NCS, Adobe RGB, or sRGB, which use math to describe colors. A color model is a theoretical way to describe colors as numbers, but it's not useful without a connection to a real-world color space. For example, Adobe RGB and sRGB are two color spaces based on the RGB model. When creating a color space, people often use CIELAB or CIEXYZ, which cover all colors the human eye can perceive. \nHCL is a color space that combines features from cylindrical translations like HSL and HSV, which are similar to RGB but better for human perception in noisy environments. However, HSL and HSV don't match human perception of color brightness, while L*a*b* aligns with how we see colors, but has issues with hue accuracy, especially in blue."}], "output": "\nBlue.**"},

The film takes her on a pretend journey from Waltham Abbey where Harold is buried, all the way to the area where the Battle of Hastings and William the Conqueror's invasion of England in 1066 took place. It also features input from famous people like Alan Moore, Iain Sinclair, Claudia Barton, and Jem Finer. \nThe Abbey Church of Waltham Holy Cross and St Lawrence is the main church in Waltham Abbey, Essex, England. It's been a place for people to pray since the 7th century. The current structure mostly dates back to the early 1100s and shows a style called Norman architecture. There's also some evidence of a big extension made to the east after the church was rebuilt in 1177. In the Middle Ages, it was one of the biggest churches in England and a popular pilgrimage spot. In 1540, it was the last religious group to close during a historical event called the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Today, it's still a functioning church for the town.\nTostig Godwinson, who was related to King Harold as his brother, was an Earl of Northumbria.

Unfortunately, Tostig met his end at the well-known Battle of Stamford Bridge. \nEdith the Fair, also known as Edith Swanneck, was King Harold Godwinson's first wife. She got her nickname Swanneck because people thought her name meant swan neck due to a misunderstanding, but it probably meant Gentle Swan in Old English.

One example is a play called Harold written by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1876, and a novel named Last of the Saxon Kings by Edward Bulwer-Lytton in 1848. Rudyard Kipling even wrote a short story in his 1910 collection called Rewards and Fairies. In this story, an old King Harold meets Henry I and passes away while held by a Saxon knight. \nThe Last English King (1997), written by Julian Rathbone, is a historical novel set during the Battle of Hastings. It follows the life of Walt Edwinson, a housecarl of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king. The story begins with Walt returning to his home in Iwerne, Dorset, four years after the battle. He had left England after the Saxons lost and traveled across Europe and Asia Minor. The novel alternates between describing Walt's journey from cities like Constantinople, Nicomedia, Nicaea, and Side, and his memories of events leading up to the battle, including accompanying Harold to William of Normandy's attack on Dinan."}], "output": "\nEssex.**"},

It has its roots in the Charles City-Henrico County Militia founded in 1652. Colonel George Washington led the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War. They participated in many battles including Great Bridge, New York Campaign, Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, Stony Point, and Charleston. Unfortunately, most of the regiment was captured by the British in South Carolina on May 12, 1780, and officially disbanded on November 15, 1783. Today, the 276th Engineer Battalion carries on the legacy of the 1st Virginia Regiment. \nOn December 9, 1775, in Great Bridge, Virginia, a battle happened early in America's Revolutionary War. The Virginia colonial militia won and because of that, the British governor, Lord Dunmore, had to leave along with the rest of the British control over Virginia. This victory marked the start of the war for the colonists.\nThe 5th Virginia Regiment was created in Richmond, Virginia, on December 28, 1775, and fought alongside the U.S. Continental Army in battles including Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Charleston. It later merged with the 3rd Virginia Regiment on May 12, 1779, and was led by Generals William Russell and Josiah Parker. \nThe 9th Virginia Regiment was created in Virginia in January 1776 and had seven companies from the eastern part of the state. It joined the Continental Army in May 1776. During the Battle of Germantown, the regiment, led by Colonel George Mathews, got separated from the rest of General Nathanael Greene's group. This led to around 400 soldiers being captured by the British. While trying to retreat, they were attacked by a group of British soldiers. Despite fighting bravely, Colonel Mathews got hurt and the regiment had to surrender near Kelly's Hill. They joined the 1st Virginia Regiment on May 12, 1779, and became known as the 1st Virginia Regiment. Unfortunately, the unit was captured by the British at the Siege of Charleston in May 1780 and was disbanded in November 1783. \nThe 1st Virginia State Regiment was a group of soldiers from Virginia who fought in the American Revolutionary War. They were created by the state government in December 1776 to protect Virginia. In 1777, Virginia had trouble providing enough soldiers for the main army, so the 1st Regiment, led by Colonel George Gibson, went to help in the Philadelphia area. In January 1778, they were chosen to stay in the Continental Army instead of the Ninth Regiment, which had been captured. The 1st Regiment stayed with the main army, living in places like Valley Forge and Middlebrook, and fought in the Battle of Monmouth. They stayed until late 1779 when they were sent back to Virginia. This regiment was unique because it had ten companies, including one that specialized in light infantry. \nThe 7th Virginia Regiment was formed on January 11, 1776, in Gloucester, Virginia, to fight with the Continental Army. They fought in battles like Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Charleston. Unfortunately, most of the regiment was captured by the British at Charleston on May 12, 1780, and they were officially disbanded on January 1, 1783.

This underground layer of water is connected to the High Plains Aquifer System and lies on top of something called the Ogallala Formation, which covers most of the High Plains area. \nOgallala is a city in Nebraska, where 4,737 people live. It's an important place because it's the main town in Keith County. A long time ago, when the country was still growing, it was a stop for the Pony Express and the big train that went across the country.

It was made by winds carrying sand up the river. The sand dune blocked a wash called Chaco Wash and created a small pond near a big house called Penasco Blanco. Around 900 CE, the dune broke, but the ancient people fixed it with stones and made a pond too. This helped with their farming because it slowed down the wash and raised the water level.

It was created for his album His Band and the Street Choir in 1970. The song was originally left out of his popular 1968 album Astral Weeks. Later, he also made different recordings for his following album Moondance. In 2013, three of those versions were included in a special extended edition of the album. \nVan Morrison's fourth studio album, His Band and the Street Choir (also known as Street Choir), was released on November 15, 1970, by Warner Bros. Records. Initially titled Virgo's Fool, the album's name was changed by the record company without his permission. The album's creation started with a demo session in a church in Woodstock, New York, in early 1970. Later that year, in the second quarter, Morrison recorded more songs at A&R Studios in New York City, which formed the basis of His Band and the Street Choir.\nVan Morrison, a singer-songwriter from Northern Ireland, created a popular song called Domino. It's the first song on his fourth music album named His Band and the Street Choir. The song is a special tribute that Morrison wrote for Fats Domino, a famous New Orleans R&B singer and piano player. \nVan Morrison's song Blue Money was a popular hit from his 1970 album, His Band and the Street Choir. It reached #23 in the US and had Sweet Thing from another album as the B-side. In the UK, it was released with a different song on the B-side. Blue Money became one of Morrison's top-selling songs in the 1970s, staying on the charts for three months. \nThe Best of Van Morrison Volume 3 is a collection of 31 songs by the singer Van Morrison, put together by him. It came out on June 11, 2007, first in the UK and then in the US on iTunes. The physical CD version was released in the US on June 19. The album has new collaborations with famous singers like Tom Jones and Bobby Bland, and also includes duets with John Lee Hooker, B.B. King, and Ray Charles. A special duet with Ray Charles, 'Crazy Love', was from his 1970 album Moondance. The song 'Blue and Green' was also on the album, originally made for a charity project to help people affected by Hurricane Katrina. 'Cry for Home' with Tom Jones was from the same sessions as their other song together on Jones' album Reload, and it was released as a single before 'Blue and Green'. \nA tribute album called No Prima Donna: The Songs of Van Morrison came out in October 1994. It honors the music of the singer-songwriter Van Morrison. Phil Coulter, a friend of Van's, produced the album. Michelle Rocca, Van's long-time girlfriend, was on the cover. What's special is that Van was involved in picking the songs and the musicians who played them, which is not common for this type of album."}], "output": "\nWarner Bros. Records.**"},

It's part of a system in our body that some medicines target to lower blood pressure. Angiotensin also makes another hormone called aldosterone. Aldosterone helps the kidneys hold onto more sodium, which contributes to higher blood pressure. \nAldosterone is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland that helps the body keep sodium and balance potassium levels. It's important for maintaining blood pressure and water balance. When it doesn't work properly, it can cause health problems like heart and kidney issues. It works differently from a hormone called atrial natriuretic hormone, which does the opposite.\nThe sodium-chloride symporter, also called NCC or NCCT, is a special protein in our kidneys that helps take in sodium and chloride from the tubular fluid into the cells of the distal convoluted tubule. This protein belongs to a group called SLC12 cotransporters. In humans, our body has this protein from a gene called SLC12A3, which is found on chromosome 16q13. \nThe loop of Henle is a part of a kidney called a nephron. It starts from the first part of the nephron called the proximal convoluted tubule and goes to the second part, the distal convoluted tubule. A German scientist named Friedrich Henle found this loop. Its main job is to help make a special concentration in the middle part of the kidney called the medulla. \nLow pressure receptors, also known as volume receptors, are found in specific parts of the veins, lungs, and heart. They sense changes in the pressure of the blood vessels when they're not full (less than 60mmHg). These receptors help control the release of hormones like antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin, and aldosterone. When the pressure in the upper heart chamber (atrium) is high, these hormones are released less. This leads to more urine being produced, which helps lower blood pressure. At the same time, stretching of the atrial receptors triggers the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which encourages the body to remove more water and salt through urine. \nRenal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a health issue where the body has too much acid because the kidneys can't make the urine as acidic as it should be. When blood goes through the kidneys, it filters out waste and exchanges important things like salts and acids. In RTA, the kidneys either don't absorb enough alkaline bicarbonate ions early on (in the proximal tubule) or don't release enough acidic hydrogen ions later on (in the distal tubule). This leads to a problem called metabolic acidosis. RTA is for people whose kidneys work fine but have trouble with urine acidity. There are different types of RTA, each with its own set of symptoms and causes."}], "output": "\nThe adrenal gland.**"},

Thompkins and Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan which one was a  case decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court of the United States? \n\n Passage: \nIn 1982, the Supreme Court of the United States made a decision in a case called Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan. They ruled that the University's policy of only admitting one gender was against the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment of the US Constitution. The decision was close, with the court voting 5-4. \nIn the 2010 case Berghuis v. Thompkins (docket 08-1470), the US Supreme Court examined a situation where a person knows they have the right to remain silent because of Miranda v. Arizona, but doesn't say it out loud or give up that right.\nThe Hoffman v. Jones case, decided by the Florida Supreme Court in 1973, marked the first time the comparative negligence rule was introduced in negligence law through a court ruling instead of a law. Lawyer Sammy Cacciatore Jr. played a significant role in this change. The case involved the death of William Harrison Jones Jr., who was hit by a truck driven by Philip Francis Hoffman Jr. This was the first instance where a state's highest court in the US abandoned the old rule of contributory negligence, which prevented injured people from receiving compensation if they were partly responsible. The court adopted pure comparative negligence, where victims can still be compensated based on the percentage of fault by the defendant. This decision has had a lasting impact, being included in law school textbooks and now being the standard rule in negligence cases. \nThe first case the United States Supreme Court heard was Van Staphorst v. Maryland in 1791. However, it was resolved before the oral arguments. The first appellate case they took on was Collet v. Collet, and they gave their first decision in West v. Barnes. \nIn a big court decision called Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt in 2016, the United States Supreme Court said that Texas can't make rules that make it too hard for women to get abortions. They said these rules should not cause problems for women. The same day, the court decided not to look at similar cases from Wisconsin and Mississippi where other judges had already said those rules were not okay. This might affect other states with similar laws too. \nThe US Supreme Court ruled in 1943 that during wartime, it was okay for the government to put curfews on people from a certain minority group, like Japanese Americans, if their country was at war with the US. This happened after the Pearl Harbor attack and the US entered World War II. President Roosevelt allowed military leaders to restrict certain areas and Japanese Americans had to follow a curfew and other rules before being sent to internment camps. Gordon Hirabayashi was put on trial for breaking the curfew and appealed to the Supreme Court. Another case, Yasui v. United States, was also decided that day. Both convictions were later overturned in 1980."}], "output": "\nMississippi University for Women v. Hogan.**"},

There was a problem because a fire at PWL Studios burned some of Astley's music, so the album was late.

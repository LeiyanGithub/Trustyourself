They played in a small arena, the Centennial Ice Arena, which could hold only 550 people. It was always full when they had games because people loved watching. Before, they played in a bigger place called Metrapark that could hold up to 9,000 people, but they had a problem with the people in charge and the county, so they had to stop playing there. \nThe Robins Center is a big place in Richmond, Virginia, with 7,201 seats, where people go to watch sports and events. It was opened in 1972 and is used by the University of Richmond's basketball team. In 1983, they had a big basketball tournament there. The arena is named after a man, E. Claiborne Robins Sr., who helped a lot with the school. Before the Robins Center, the team played games in different places around Richmond, like a big gym, a arena, and even a school. It's also a special place for important events like graduations and had a big debate in 1992. \nThe QMJHL, a hockey league in Quebec, started its 2011-12 season in September and went on until March. There were 17 teams playing 68 games each. Blainville-Boisbriand Armada, a new team, started playing in Boisbriand after moving from Verdun. Unfortunately, the Lewiston Maineiacs stopped playing, and the league decided to add a new team in Sherbrooke for next season. The Saint John Sea Dogs became the first team to win two championships in a row. \nLoan modification is a process where mortgage loan agreements are changed to help people having trouble paying by lowering interest rates, monthly payments, or reducing the principal amount. This is done by lenders to prevent foreclosures and save borrowers from financial distress. It started after the 2008 housing market crash in the US, with major banks like Washington Mutual, Chase, and JP Morgan among others involved. Some employees involved in mortgage and real estate had illegal practices, leading to the creation of the FBI Mortgage Fraud Department and government programs like HAMP (Home Affordable Modification Program) and HARP (Home Affordable Refinance Program) to help homeowners through legal modifications.\n\nBefore the crash, during the Great Depression, similar programs were used to help reduce foreclosures. However, during the 2008 recession, loan modifications became a national policy to prevent further economic problems. The focus was on assisting homeowners who were victims of predatory lending practices and unethical behavior by lenders, brokers, and attorneys.\n\nTo address the issues, the IRS created teams called HAMP TEAMS to develop new loan modification products. These modifications were designed to be legal and fair, helping homeowners avoid losing their homes due to illegal actions by lending institutions. As a result, the FBI and other government agencies were tasked with monitoring lending institutions to ensure compliance and prevent fraud.\n\nThe key point is that the crash was not caused by the housing market but by the loan products and the unethical practices of lenders who took advantage of homeowners, particularly through balloon mortgages. Modifications were introduced to correct these issues, and the government took action to protect consumers and hold banks accountable for their wrongdoings.\n\nIn conclusion, loan modification is a legal process that helps struggling homeowners by adjusting mortgage terms to avoid foreclosures. It was created in response to the 2008 housing market crash, where illegal practices by lending institutions were exposed, leading to government intervention and the establishment of programs to ensure fairness and protect the rights of mortgage note holders. \nCase Gym is a big room with 1,800 seats in Boston, Massachusetts.

This decision came from a vote on March 2, 2004. People who wanted this, called GMO Free Mendocino, were from local farms and groups who thought GMOs might be bad for people's health and the environment, but not everyone agreed. Some big companies that make and sell seeds, like Monsanto, DuPont, and Dow Chemical, didn't like this. Because of the ban, Mendocino County is now on a list of places that don't allow GMOs.

It's part of a bigger field called Financial Technology (FinTech) because real estate is a big investment. People invest in different types of properties like homes, offices, and factories to make money - either for living in or to earn more through renting or selling. Real estate has become a more important long-term investment option because it's more efficient and can help protect against changes in stock and bond returns. It's also known for being a good way to diversify a investment portfolio and protect against inflation. \nLoan modification is a process to help people who have trouble paying their mortgages by lowering interest rates, monthly payments, or reducing the principal balance. This is done by lenders to prevent foreclosures. It started in the US after the 2008 housing market crash, with institutions like Washington Mutual and Chase Home Finance making changes. The Housing and Mortgage Assistance Programs (HAMP and HARP) were created to help homeowners who were victims of bad lending practices. The IRS and the government also got involved to offer loan modifications as a way to protect homeowners from losing their homes.\n\nBefore modifications, during the Great Depression, there were programs like loan transfers and assumptions to avoid foreclosures. Now, the government has policies to address the housing crisis, and loan modifications have become a national priority. These changes were necessary to prevent further economic instability. However, the focus has been on the mortgage products and the actions of some lending institutions, which led to illegal practices like predatory lending and fraud.\n\nTo fix the issues, the FBI and other agencies were created to investigate and prosecute fraudulent activities. Modifications were introduced to correct the mortgage terms and protect homeowners, but it also exposed illegal activities where lenders, attorneys, and real estate staff misused the homeowner's money. These actions led to the creation of laws and regulations to hold these individuals and institutions accountable.\n\nIn summary, loan modification is a way for struggling homeowners to get help with their mortgages, and it has become an important tool in addressing the housing crisis. The government's involvement, along with legal actions against fraudulent practices, has aimed to protect consumers and restore fairness in the real estate market. \nSouth Phoenix is a part of Phoenix, Arizona, close to the Gila River Indian Community to the south and west.

Low-cost ones can control only a few devices, but better ones (mid- and high-end) can add new control codes, making it more flexible. Some electronic gadgets come with universal remote features that let them control other devices besides the one they were made for, like a VCR remote can control TVs. \nA remote control is a tool that lets you control an electronic device without touching it from far away. For example, in your living room, you can use it to turn on your TV or DVD player without having to be right next to them. It's a helpful feature because it lets you use devices that are hard to reach, like a garage door opener from outside or a projector on a high ceiling. \nExplanation: The paragraph is about a remote control called the Siri Remote, made by Apple. It was shown at a special event by Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, on October 26, 2015, along with the 4th generation Apple TV. The Siri Remote is made to work well with the Apple TV that always has Siri, and it replaces the old one. It even works with the newer Apple TV 4K.\n\nRevised paragraph: The Siri Remote is a remote made by Apple for their 4th generation Apple TV. It was introduced by Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, at a meeting in 2015. It's designed to work with the Apple TV that can use Siri. It's an updated version of the earlier remote and can also be used with the Apple TV 4K. \nNetSupport Manager is a software that lets you control and manage other computers remotely, from Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris, or even mobile devices like Windows Mobile and tablets. It was first made for DOS in 1989, but now it supports showing small pictures of remote systems and switching between them like a KVM switch. You can send files, talk, and check hardware and software on the other device. For Linux and Mac, it has fewer features. In 2012, they added support for iOS, Android, and Mac OS, and in 2013, it even works with ChromeOS. To use it, you need to install it on both the controlling and the controlled devices. \nApple Watch is a smartwatch made by Apple. It helps you stay healthy and works with their phones and other Apple things. It comes in different sizes and looks with different bands. You need an iPhone to use it for things like calling and messaging. It was first made and sold in 2015 and became very popular. They made a new version in 2016 and another one in 2017. \nMacScan is a tool made for Mac OS X by SecureMac that helps remove bad things called malware, like spyware and sneaky programs that record your keystrokes. It was the first one to do this for Macs. It also checks if other programs that can control your computer from far away, like Apple Remote Desktop, are there only because you allowed them to be. \nTMCC, a Lionel system for O scale trains, was active from 1994 to 2006. It's like DCC, a popular system used in other train models. The good thing about TMCC is that it can work with different types of trains, even those not made by Lionel, as long as they have compatible parts. MTH Corporation's DCS can also control TMCC trains. Both TMCC and DCS work by sending signals to the train, but DCS uses the train's electrical contacts.\n\nTo control a train, you need a controller (like a remote for a TV or a garage door opener). Some systems, like LionChief and LionChief+, need their own separate remote that's connected directly to the locomotive. In 2017, Lionel made a universal remote for LionChief+ that can easily control multiple trains at once. \nApple Remote Desktop (ARD) is a program made by Apple for Mac computers. It started in 2002 and replaced a similar tool called Apple Network Assistant. It's meant for people who take care of many computers, like IT administrators, and teachers who need to help one person or show a group how to use a computer. ARD helps control or watch other computers from a network."}], "output": "\nThe device that can control the program Apple Remote was originally designed to interact with, aside from the Apple Remote itself, is the Apple TV.**"},

This album was created to go with a dance performance by Monster Squad, a dance company in the same city. It has three songs without any singing, and people think of it as a special kind of music for a show, similar to how Peter Gabriel or Badly Drawn Boy made music for a movie called About a Boy."}], "output": "\nBased on the information provided, Badly Drawn Boy has a higher instrument to person ratio in their performance act. This is because Badly Drawn Boy's debut album, The Hour of Bewilderbeast, was made by Damon Gough, who played different instruments and did all the singing and producing. This indicates that he is not only the main performer but also handles a significant part of the instrumental aspects. In contrast, Wolf Alice is not mentioned in this passage in relation to a similar ratio."},

The band had a singer named Robert Roth who played guitar and sang, and two other band members, Hiro Yamamoto who played bass (he was also in Soundgarden) and Mark Pickerel who played drums (he was in Screaming Trees). Even though they weren't as famous as other bands from Seattle, they lasted for 10 years and made two albums. \nThe Screaming Trees only made one album with Sub Pop, called Change Has Come. In 1990, they left Sub Pop and went to a bigger company, Epic Records, for their next four albums and an EP called Something About Today. This means they didn't continue with Sub Pop after Change Has Come. \nBeat Happening's second album, Jamboree, was released in 1988. It's made by K Records and Rough Trade Records. All songs, except for one, were made by Steve Fisk with help from musicians from Screaming Trees. Some tracks were produced by other people like Mark Lanegan and Gary Lee Conner. The album is different from their earlier ones because it sounds darker and has a heavier sound. Calvin Johnson wrote most of the songs, and Heather Lewis only sang on a few. Calvin called it dark and sexy. Even though it's more serious, the band still has fun and doesn't worry too much about perfect playing. During the recording of one song, Bret Lunsford accidentally hit his guitar string, but kept playing until it was fixed. \nGary Lee Conner, born Lee Gary Conner in 1962, was the lead guitarist for Screaming Trees, a rock band. His brother Van was the bassist. Gary started with Screaming Trees in 1985 and the band ended in 2000. During his time there, he made two albums outside the band: The Purple Outside-Mystery Lane in 1990 and a single Grasshopper's Daydream/Behind The Smile in 1999. He also played with other musicians like Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age and appeared on albums by Beat Happening, Midnight a Go-Go, and Mike Watt's Against the 70s. In 2010, he released a new album called 4D Sugarcubes and later had plans for more releases. In 2016, he released a solo album called Ether Trippers. \nMad Season was a rock band from Seattle, formed in 1994 by people from famous bands Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, and Screaming Trees. They made one album called Above and are famous for a song called River of Deceit. They took a break in 1996 because everyone was busy and Layne Staley, the singer, had drug issues. They tried to come back in the late 1990s, but the band stopped in 1999 when their bassist, John Baker Saunders, passed away. Sadly, Layne Staley died from a drug overdose three years later. \nBeat Happening and Screaming Trees made a special EP and music together in 1988. It came out on a record called Homestead Records. Later, in 2002, it was put back in a Beat Happening box set called Crashing Through. Kurt Cobain, who was part of Nirvana, wrote a note in his journal saying Polly Pereguin was his favorite pop song from the 1980s, and he told it to Mark Lanegan. \nScreaming Trees, a rock band from Ellensburg, Washington, has 7 studio albums, 3 collection albums, 5 EPs, and 6 singles. But this doesn't count the songs they made individually by each band member. \nVan Conner, born in 1967 in Apple Valley, California, is a rock musician. In 1984, he and his brother Gary formed a band called Screaming Trees with friends Mark Lanegan and Mark Pickerel. In 2000, Screaming Trees stopped officially. After that, Van started a quieter band called Gardener, which made one album in the 1990s.

A group called the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, took control in October 1917 and created the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. They had a big fight called the Russian Civil War with others. In 1922, the Bolsheviks won and formed the Soviet Union. Lenin passed away and Joseph Stalin, who was also a Communist, took over in 1924. He controlled the party until 1953 and made many people scared with his policies. \nLavr Kornilov, born on August 18, 1870, was a Russian army officer, explorer, and a general. During World War I and the Russian Civil War, he worked in military intelligence. He is famous for the Kornilov Affair, which happened in 1917. Kornilov tried to support a government leader named Alexander Kerensky, but his plan didn't work. Kerensky caught Kornilov and thought he was trying to take power. This made Kerensky lose trust and the Bolsheviks, who were supported by the people, became stronger. \nExplanation: The paragraph is about the反抗 Bolsheviks from the left side, which were reactions from other left groups against the Bolsheviks after a big change in Russia in 1917. These uprisings happened during a big war (Russian Civil War) and continued even when the Bolsheviks controlled the country. The groups involved were not always on the same side, like the Socialist Revolutionary Party, Left Socialists, Mensheviks, and anarchists. The uprisings lasted until around 1924. The Bolsheviks tried to stop these groups from joining their government and used force to do so. \n\n Simplified: After a big change in Russia in 1917, there were rebellions from other left groups against the Bolsheviks, who were in control. These uprisings, called the left-wing uprisings, lasted from 1918 to 1924. The Bolsheviks didn't want these groups to join their government and often used force to stop them. \nLouise Bryant was an American lady who worked as a journalist and activist. She wrote about the Russian Revolution, which was happening from 1917, and was very friendly to the people in charge like Lenin and Trotsky. She got married to a writer named John Reed in 1916. Her stories about Russia, especially during the war, were printed in newspapers in the US and Canada. She even wrote a book called Six Red Months in Russia in 1918 about her first trip. Then, she talked to a special group of senators in 1919 to explain why she thought the revolution was good. Finally, she went on a tour to tell people about the revolution and asked them not to send soldiers to help. Louise Bryant passed away in 1936. \nThe Battle of Romanovka happened in June 1919 during a big fight in Russia. Some Russian leaders, led by Yakov Triapitsyn, tried to surprise an American army camp in a place called Romanovka, close to Vladivostok. But the American soldiers were able to stop them. This was the last main fight between the American and Russian groups in the Russian Civil War. After this, there were smaller fights, mostly won by the Americans, involving the Bolsheviks and Cossacks. \nThe Kerensky-Krasnov uprising was when Alexander Kerensky, a leader, tried to come back in charge after the Bolsheviks removed his government in Petrograd. \nTimofey Petrovich Samsonov was a Soviet politician who lived from 1888 to 1955. He was involved in the Russian Civil War and was chosen to be part of the important decisions made by the Communist Party. He served on the Central Committee three times, at Congresses 15, 16, and 17. He worked as a leader, first as Chief Administrator from 1927 to 1935, and then as the head of the Accounting Department from 1932 to 1934. Samsonov passed away in Moscow. \n\nExplanation: This version simplifies the text by breaking down the information into smaller, easier-to-understand parts. It mentions his role as a politician, his involvement with the Communist Party, and his specific job positions, without using complex political terms. \nAlexander Kerensky was a Russian lawyer who played a big role in the 1917 revolution. He started in the government as Minister of Justice, then became Minister of War, and later the second in charge. He was part of a group called Trudoviks and was in charge of an important group in Petrograd. In November, a group led by Lenin took over and he left the government. He lived in other countries like Paris and New York and worked for a special group called the Hoover Institution later in his life."}], "output": "\nThe civil war that ended with Alexander Kerensky being defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks, also known as the Russian Civil War, lasted from 1918 to 1922.**"},

This happened when an airship called Italia crashed on the Arctic ice and they all disappeared. \nEnrico Fermi was a famous physicist from Italy. He built the first nuclear reactor, called the Chicago Pile-1, which started the nuclear age. Some people call him the architect of the atomic bomb. Fermi was really good at both math and experiments. He got a big prize in 1938 for finding new elements with neutrons and his work on radioactivity. He also helped create important theories in physics, like quantum theory, nuclear and particle stuff, and understanding how things work with lots of particles. \nExplanation: The Micropædia is a small part of a bigger set. It's part of the 15th edition of a big book called Encyclopædia Britannica. There are three main parts: Micropædia, Propædia (a short introduction), and Macropædia (for bigger topics). The word Micropædia comes from Greek words for small and teaching. A good way to understand it is short lessons. \nClaudio Pellegrini, born in Rome on May 9, 1935, is an Italian physicist who discovered important things about X-ray free electron lasers and how particles move really fast. He studied at Rome's Sapienza University and got top honors in 1958. From 1958 to 1978, he worked at a place in Italy that studied high energy and nuclear stuff. In the early 1960s, he went to a place in Denmark to study a different way of understanding gravity. In 1978, he moved to the US and worked at a big lab where he helped with a special light source. In 1989, he became a teacher at UCLA and later became a very special teacher, known as a Distinguished Professor. \nChiara R. Nappi is an Italian physicist who works on topics like math physics, particle physics, and string theory. \nSergio Ferrara, born on May 2, 1945, is a physicist from Italy. He studies tiny particles and math in physics. He's famous for finding special theories that connect particles and make them work together (super-Yang-Mills) and for a big upgrade to how gravity works (supergravity). He worked with others to create this, and now he's a part-time worker at CERN and a teacher at the University of California, Los Angeles. \nAntonino Lo Surdo, born on February 4, 1880 in Syracuse, Italy, was a physicist. He started teaching physics at a place called Istituto di Fisica in Rome in 1919. When the person in charge, Orso Mario Corbino, passed away in 1937, Lo Surdo became the boss of the place. He mainly studied about the Earth, like earthquakes and how the ground moves. Sadly, a big earthquake in Messina in 1908 took away his family, except for his brother. He also helped create an important Earth science institute called Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica with the help of a famous person named Guglielmo Marconi."}], "output": "\nClaudio Pellegrini.**"},

It's smaller and stronger than the American Rat Terrier, with shorter legs and heavier bones. It comes from different dogs like Rat Terriers, Fox Paulistinha, and Tenterfield Terriers that early English and other workers brought over. Since it was mainly a farm, hunting, and work dog, there wasn't much planned breeding. It has traits from other dogs like Feists, Bull Terriers, and Beagles.\n\nThese early terriers were mixed with Beagle or Beagle-like dogs for better scenting. This breeding created a dog with a great sense of smell, high intelligence, and a strong desire to work with its owner. Even though they can be a bit distant with strangers, they are loyal and always want to be by their owner's side. \nA Feist is a small dog that comes from a group of terriers brought to the US by workers from England. These dogs were originally used to catch rats because their owners liked to bet on them. Over time, they mixed with other dogs like Smooth Fox Terriers, Manchester Terriers, and even an old type called English White Terrier. They were not just rat catchers but also got faster with Whippets and Italian Greyhounds, and better at hunting with Beagles. This made the Feist a dog with many purposes, not just for rat catching. \nExplanation: The English Setter is a medium-sized dog from the Setter family. This family includes other setters like red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters. The dog has a white body with long, soft hair around the legs, under its belly, and on its tail. The coat has little spots of different colors, and these different colors are called belton. \n\n Simplified: The English Setter is a medium-sized dog with a white coat, long hair on their legs, belly, and tail. Their coat has some colored patches, and these patches are called belton. \nThe Russian Toy Dog, also called the Russkiy Toy or Toychik, comes from the English Toy Terrier, which is now called the Manchester Terrier. It's a tiny dog breed originally from Russia. There are two types: one with a smooth coat and another with a long coat, previously known as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier. In 1988, they combined both into one breed, 'Russian Toy Terrier'. In 2006, the 'Terrier' part was dropped and the breed was recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale.

You can change the pitch by adjusting the tightness of the strings. There are little strips called frets on the neck that help you play notes more clearly and sound better. Viols first appeared in Spain a long time ago, during the Renaissance and Baroque times (around 1500-1750). They come from older instruments like the rebab from阿拉伯 and the vielle from Europe. They are related to the Venetian viole and the Spanish vihuela, which were similar to a lute but not exactly the same as the guitar. \nA collie is a special kind of herding dog that comes from Scotland and Northern England. They are medium-sized dogs with a pointed snout and often have a white mark on their shoulders. They are very active, good at running and can easily follow animals.

Some are still used for working, like herding animals, while others are kept as pets, show dogs, or for fun dog activities like agility and sports. The American Kennel Club (AKC) recognizes collies as a type, but there are differences between dogs used for shows and those trained for herding competitions. They are known for their intelligence, agility, and ability to learn quickly. \nThe Toy Manchester Terrier is a small dog breed that is a type of terrier.

It started because Italy thought a treaty made Ethiopia an Italian protectorate. Italy had friends in Germany and Austria who helped. But, they found the Ethiopian leader, Menelik II, was actually working with them, not against them. So, when the Italian army tried to invade from Italian Eritrea, they faced a stronger Ethiopia. Russia, a Christian country, also helped Ethiopia by giving advice, training, and selling weapons. Other countries, like the UK and France, supported Ethiopia to stop Italy from becoming a big colonial power. The war started in 1895, and the Italians won at first. But, Ethiopia fought back and won at a big battle called the Battle of Adwa. This made the Italians give up and go back to Eritrea. \nEthiopia and Japan have a special relationship because both countries have a long history of successfully fighting against big European countries that wanted to control them. They saw themselves as friends before World War II because they had similar experiences of standing up to power. The Battle of Adwa is about Ethiopia and the Battle of Tsushima is about Japan, both of which were important moments in their history. \nEthiopia is a country in Africa that's surrounded by other countries like Eritrea, Sudan, South Sudan, Kenya, Somalia, and Djibouti. It's one of the oldest countries in the world and has a lot of history. People believe that Ethiopia was where humans first left for other places. The country has a long history that starts with Emperor Menelik I around 1000 BC. Ethiopia has been a continuous state since the Aksumite Empire in the 4th century. In the past, the country had some division, but it was united again in 1855. Ethiopia expanded its borders during the 19th century and was able to keep Italy from controlling it in 1896. It was controlled by Italy from 1936 to 1941 and was later freed by British and Ethiopian forces. \nSaint Ephigenia, also known as Iphigenia of Ethiopia, is a special person from a long time ago who became a Christian. She was told by a very important Christian man named St. Matthew to be close to God. St. Matthew was trying to share the Christian teachings with a place called Ethiopia, which might have been in a place near the Caspian Sea, either in places like Assyria or Babylon or in Armenia. \nHerbert S. Lewis, born in 1934, is a retired anthropology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He taught there from 1963 to 1998. He has done a lot of field research, especially in Ethiopia. In Ethiopia, he studied the history of the Oromo people's kingdom called Jimma Abba Jifar and the lives of the Oromos from two different periods, 1958-60 and 1965-66. Some of his pictures from these research are available in the university's Digital Library. His work in Ethiopia focused on political leadership, community organization, ethnohistory, and understanding the culture's past. His main book, A Galla Monarchy: Jimma Abba Jifar, Ethiopia, 1830-1932, is about the monarchy's structure, the ruler's power, and its beginnings. In 1965-66, he studied how spirit mediums, called k'allu, who were leaders in religious and conflict resolution, also provided some political guidance in rural areas. \nP'ent'ay is a term in Amharic and Tigrinya used to describe Christians who follow Protestant denominations, especially those who practice Pentecostal beliefs. It started being used in the 1960s as a way to criticize churches with Pentecostal experiences. Now, it's used for any Protestant Ethiopian or Eritrean who is not part of the Orthodox Tewahedo or Eritrean Orthodox churches.\n\nThe word P'ent'ay comes from Pentecostal, but it's often used to refer to all Protestant Christians, regardless of their specific beliefs. Some Orthodox people might also use it for the Catholic minority in Ethiopia. In other languages, this group might be called Evangelicals. The main Protestant denominations in Ethiopia are the Kale Heywet (Word of Life), Mekane Yesus (Place of Jesus), Lutheran, Mulu Wongel (Full Gospel), and Meserete Kristos (Christ Foundation or Mennonite).\n\nThere are some P'ent'ay communities, especially those associated with Mekane Yesus, that have been influenced by the Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which is the mainstream Ethiopian Christian tradition. However, most P'ent'ay churches are quite Pentecostal in their worship and beliefs. \nThe Second Battle of Agordat happened in December 1893. Italian soldiers from a place called Italy and some people from Sudan called Mahdists fought against each other. A leader named Ahmed Ali, with around 10,000 to 12,000 men, went east from a place called Kassala. They met 2,400 Italian soldiers and their helpers from a place called Eritrea at Agordat, not too far from Asmara. In a very tough battle, over 1,000 Dervishes, including Ahmed Ali, were killed. This battle decided something important. \nThe Treaty of Addis Ababa, signed on October 23, 1896, officially ended the First Italo-Ethiopian War. It was a good deal for Ethiopia because it mostly gave them what they wanted. Before this, Ethiopia and Italy secretly agreed, but after Ethiopia won a big battle called the Battle of Adwa in March, Ethiopia's leader, Menelik II, didn't follow that secret agreement. Instead, the treaty said Ethiopia would be independent and the Italian agreement from before (called Treaty of Wuchale) would not be valid anymore."}], "output": "\nIndependence.**"},

It's an important place for things like administration and culture in East Lothian. In the late 1800s, East Lothian became known as Haddingtonshire because of changes in government.

The box set didn't include songs that were later mixed only in stereo or ones that had mono versions made from both stereo channels.\n\nIn the Mono Masters album, some songs from Past Masters are different because they were removed (like Old Brown Shoe, The Ballad of John and Yoko, and Let It Be) and some new songs from stereo albums with unreleased mono versions were added. There were also some songs that were meant to be on a 7-inch EP but never happened, and their mono versions were never released.\n\nOne song, Get Back, was the last one the Beatles made for mono, and it was released in mono in the UK but stereo in the US. So, if you listen to the Mono Masters album, you won't hear the stereo versions of the songs that were released in the UK on singles. \nExplanation: \n\nThe Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 is a collection of the band's songs, released in 1993 by Atlantic Records. It has two albums and includes all the songs from Led Zeppelin's albums that were not in a previous set from 1990. The songs have been made better quality with digital remastering, and there's a new, never-before-heard song called 'Baby Come On Home.' The box set also has a 54-page book with information about the band. You can find every song from their nine studio albums, two BBC live recordings, one extra song that wasn't on any album, and one studio version that was not included in previous collections. \nThe Doors Vinyl Box Set is a set of 7 records for the rock band The Doors. It includes all 6 original albums, which have been remastered in stereo and have a mono version of their first album. The set looks and feels like the original ones from 1967-1971, with matching artwork and inner sleeves. The box set was supposed to come out in 2007, but it got delayed. This was because there were issues with the vinyl records, plus other problems during the making of the box set. It was finally released in February 2008 after a long wait due to problems like wrong test pressings, problems with the artwork for 'L.A. Woman,' and finding better quality vinyl."}], "output": "\nThe song that was inspired by words on a tombstone and was the first track on the box set Back to Mono is not mentioned in the passage provided.

He was in charge of the Communist Party of Ukraine for some years and was the big boss of the government. In 1977, another important person, Leonid Brezhnev, took his place and he had to stop being in charge. That same year, he could not be in the top group anymore and had to stop being involved in politics. \nAndrei Pavlovich Kirilenko, born in 1906 to a Ukrainian family in Alexeyevka, was a Soviet leader during the Cold War. He started his career with a vocational school education and later studied aviation in the 1930s. He joined the Communist Party in 1930. Kirilenko worked his way up in the Soviet government, becoming Vice-Chairman of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) in the 1960s. After Khrushchev's removal, he became a key figure under Leonid Brezhnev. \nThe MS Excelsior Neptune, once known as Feliks Dzerzhinskiy, was a big ship that sailed on the sea. It belonged to a company from the Soviet Union that worked with boats on the Black Sea. This ship was made in 1958 in a place called Wismar, East Germany.

After graduating in 1916, he joined the army and worked as a doctor, becoming involved in secret Bolshevik military activities. During the October Revolution, he served on the Military Revolutionary Committee and impressed Trotsky, who made him his deputy on the Revolutionary Military Council. Sklyansky did a great job during the Russian Civil War, improving the army's condition. However, in 1924, he was replaced by Grigory Zinoviev's ally, and later, he worked as the chairman of a textile trust. In 1925, he died in a suspicious boating accident, which some believe was ordered by Stalin to silence him. A defector named Boris Bazhanov believed the death was part of a plan by key figures. \nAnastas Mikoyan was a very important person in Soviet history. He was a part of the Communist Party from the early days and worked for leaders like Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev, and Brezhnev. He was unique because he stayed in top positions in the party for many years, even during changes in power between the Central Committee and the Politburo. He retired peacefully when Brezhnev took over. \nDavid Waksberg, born in 1956 in New York City, was a big helper for Jewish people in the Soviet Union during the 1980s and 1990s.

It's a plant in the Caryophyllaceae family and can be found in many places, including Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa. It's a small plant, either growing as an annual, sometimes lasting for two years, or a short-lived perennial, reaching heights of 40-80 cm. In the US, it's also known as bladder campion, but don't mix it up with Silene vulgaris, which is commonly called the bladder campion too. \nThe Gibraltar campion, a special flower plant called Silene tomentosa, is very hard to find. It belongs to the Silene family and the Caryophyllaceae group. It's not a tall plant, only about 40cm, and it has pink or light purple flowers with two lobes. It can only be found in a place called Gibraltar. \nSilene conoidea is a type of flowering plant called weed silene or large sand catchfly. It comes from Europe and Asia, but it can be found as a weed in parts of North America. It's a short plant, about a meter tall, with a soft stem that has some small, sticky glands. The leaves are flat and pointed, about 12 centimeters wide at the bottom, and smaller higher up. The flower is hidden inside a thick, fuzzy calyx made of connected sepals. The calyx has ridges and many lines on it. The petals are bright pink and come out from the top of the flower. \nSilene stenophylla, also known as narrow-leafed campion, is a type of flowering plant in the Caryophyllaceae family. It can be found in cold areas like the Arctic tundra in Siberia and the mountains of Japan. In 2012, scientists were able to bring back a plant from ancient samples that were 32,000 years old, which were also found in the same region as living plants. \nMenzies' campion, also known as Menzies' catchfly, is a type of flowering plant in the pink family. It's native to parts of western North America, starting from Alaska, all the way to Canada and西南 US. It's quite common in many areas where it grows, and can be found in various habitats.\n\nThe plant is a perennial herb, often looking like a mat or can be upright, with stems between a few centimeters to half a meter long. It's usually covered in hair, especially on the upper parts. The leaves are shaped like lances, arranged opposite each other, and can be a few centimeters long. Sometimes, flowers appear in a cluster at the top of the stem or in the leaf stems.\n\nEach flower is protected by a hairy, sepal-covered cup. The petals are white and have two points. The plant is unique because it's dioecious, meaning it has male and female plants that look the same but have different parts for reproduction. The male plant has full stamens, while the female plant's stamens are reduced. \nSuksdorf's silene, also known as Suksdorf's catchfly or Cascade alpine campion, is a type of flowering plant in the pink family. It grows in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, from Washington and Idaho to northern California, typically on high mountain slopes and forested areas below the tree line. This plant is short and thick, with several stems coming from a woody base, and has a clumpy appearance.\n\nEach stem can reach heights of 10 to 15 centimeters and has a fuzzy texture, with sticky areas on the upper parts. The leaves are gathered around the base, soft, and covered in fine hairs. solitary flowers appear on stems and are protected by a purple, veined calyx that also has purple hairs. The petals are white or have a purple tint, with two lobes at the ends and small appendages at the base. \nSleepy Silene, also called Sleepy Catchfly, is a type of pretty flowering plant in the pink family. It comes from North America and parts of South America, but in Europe, it's found as a plant that someone brought over from another place. \nSilene are plants with special flowers that don't have both male and female parts on the same plant. They have a special way of reproducing where they have a different type of chromosome, called XY. These chromosomes developed around 5-10 million years ago. Scientists like geneticists and biologists find Silene interesting because they are one of only a few plants that have genes that help decide if a plant will be a boy or a girl. They study Silene because they can make plants with different ways to have babies, and people usually think the Y chromosome is the one that decides the sex of the baby."}], "output": "\nYes, both Ferocactus and Silene are types of plants. Ferocactus is a genus of cacti, while Silene is a genus within the Caryophyllaceae family, which includes various types of flowering plants such as the white campion, Menzies' campion, and Suksdorf's silene.**"},

It involved places like the Philippines, parts of the Dutch East Indies (except for one island), Borneo, Australia, and its area called New Guinea (which includes a group of islands). The Allies controlled this area through their South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command. In World War II, from 1941 to 1945, the United States had two main areas in the Pacific where they fought. These were called the Pacific Ocean Areas (POA). There were three parts: Central Pacific, North Pacific, and South Pacific, which were led by Admiral Chester Nimitz. Another area, called the South West Pacific Area (SWPA), was commanded by General Douglas MacArthur. In 1945, they added a new group, the United States Strategic Air Forces in the Pacific, led by General Carl Spaatz. \nThe SM.79 Sparviero was an Italian plane with three engines. It was made of wood and metal and was meant to be a fast passenger plane. From 1937 to 1939, it broke 26 world speed records, making it the fastest medium bomber for a while. During the Spanish Civil War and World War II, it flew everywhere Italy fought. It worked well as a torpedo bomber in the Mediterranean and became famous. It had a special hump on its fuselage that pilots called the damned hunchback. \nExplanation: The South West Pacific Area (SWPA) was a special group of powerful leaders during World War II. It was part of the big Allied teams in the Pacific Ocean. SWPA was in charge of a big area that had the Philippines, Borneo, parts of Indonesia, East Timor, Australia, Papua and New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands on the west. The main groups in SWPA were from the United States and Australia, but other countries like the Netherlands, Philippines, and the British also joined in. \nExplanation: The Tupolev Tu-12, previously known as Tu-77, was a special plane made in the Soviet Union. It was made to test how jet engines work in a big plane, after World War II. It was created to help Tupolev and their air force understand the challenges of using a jet-powered bomber. \n\nRewritten: The Tupolev Tu-12, or Tu-77, was a test jet bomber made in Russia after the war. It was made to learn about using jet engines in a bigger plane, and it was part of their practice before fully switching to jet technology. \nNo. 12 Squadron was a part of the Royal Australian Air Force. It started in 1939 and during World War II, they flew missions in the South West Pacific. From 1941 to 1943, they mainly checked the waters near Australia. From November 1943 to July 1944, they were at Merauke in New Guinea. In 1945, they changed to being a heavy bomber until the war ended. Then, they became No. 1 Squadron again in 1948. In 1973, they flew helicopters but stopped in 1989. \nExplanation: The Coastwatchers, often called the Coast Watch Organisation, were special helpers for the Allies during World War II. They were stationed on faraway Pacific islands to watch and understand the enemy's actions, and they also helped save people who were stuck there. They were very important for knowing when and where the enemy was planning something, especially during a big battle called the Guadalcanal campaign. \nEdwin Doss was a pilot in the US Air Force during big wars. He flew a lot, over 4,500 hours, and was on 280 missions. For his work, he got special awards like the Distinguished Flying Cross and Legion of Merit twice. In Korea, he got more medals too. He was in charge of groups and helped with long-range flying tactics."}], "output": "\nNo. 12 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force.**"},

He worked with two big opera companies, the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera, in the 1960s. He was born in Sandpoint, Idaho, and got music education from the University of Montana and the Curtis Institute of Music. In 1961, he started singing at the Santa Fe Opera and performed in different roles like Leopold, Marcello, and a Head waiter. At the NYCO, he sang roles like Escamillo in Carmen and Sharpless in Madama Butterfly. At the Met, he created new roles in two operas, Antony and Cleopatra and Mourning Becomes Electra. Sadly, he passed away at the age of 50 due to an AIDS-related illness at a hospital in Manhattan. \nExplanation: \n\nThe film La bohème is from 1988 and was made in Italy and France. It's a movie about an opera, specifically adapted from Giacomo Puccini's original work, also titled La bohème. \n\nRevised paragraph: La bohème is a 1988 movie that's a mix of Italian and French, directed by Luigi Comencini. It's a version of the opera 'La bohème' by Puccini. \nGianni Schicchi is a funny opera by Giacomo Puccini, written in 1917-18. It's part of a group of three operas called Il trittico. The story comes from a book called Divine Comedy. This opera is the third and last one in the group. It can be performed alone or with other short operas. One famous and popular part is the aria O mio babbino caro. \nO mio babbino caro is a special song from an opera called Gianni Schicchi made by Giacomo Puccini in 1918. The singer, Lauretta, sings it when she's very upset because her dad, Schicchi, and Rinuccio's family, who she loves, are having big problems. This song is simple and shows pure love, unlike the complicated and mean-spirited things happening in the opera's story set in a long time ago in Florence. It's the only big part in the whole opera. \nThe Girl of the West is an opera by Giacomo Puccini. It's three acts long and was written with a script by two people, inspired by a play written by David Belasco, an American author. This opera came after Madama Butterfly, which also used a Belasco play. People appreciate it for its big orchestral parts and how the music flows better than in Puccini's other works. It has some Debussy and Strauss-like sounds, but it's not just copying them. Some people also see similarities to Richard Wagner, but they say it still feels Italian overall. \nThe Puccini Festival is a special event that happens every summer, usually in July and August. It's a fun opera party where they show the operas made by a famous Italian composer named Giacomo Puccini. \nCesira Ferrani, born on May 8, 1863 in Turin and passed away on May 4, 1943 in Pollone, was a famous Italian opera singer. She is well-known for performing two significant roles in opera history: Mimì in the first production of Giacomo Puccini's La bohème in 1896 and the main character in Puccini's Manon Lescaut during its world premiere in 1893. Ferrani sang many different types of operas, not just those by Puccini, and included works from composers like Verdi, Gounod, Wagner, and Debussy in her repertoire. \nJacopo Puccini, an 18th-century Italian composer, was born on January 26, 1712, and passed away on May 16, 1781. He mainly lived and created music in Lucca, a city in Tuscany. Puccini was part of a family of composers, with his great-great-grandson, Giacomo Puccini, being the most well-known among them."}], "output": "\nThe city where the Prince of Tenors, likely referring to Luciano Pavarotti, starred in a film based on an opera by Giacomo Puccini is not mentioned in the provided passage.

This formation has dinosaur genera that are very young, similar to the Hell Creek Formation in the United States. \nThe Cupressus genus is a group of cypress trees, part of the Cupressaceae family. It's not a perfect group because it includes others with the same name. Scientists look at their genetic and shape traits and say they belong in the Cupressoideae subfamily. People call them cypress because it comes from two languages - Old French and Latin, both derived from a Greek word meaning  Cypress tree. \nCedrol is a type of alcohol found in the special smell of trees, like cedar and juniper. It can also be found in a plant called Origanum onites. People use it to make other smells. In Texas, it's about 19% of the cedar smell, and in Virginia, it's about 15.8%. \nLibocedrus is a type of coniferous tree, about five in number, found in two places, New Zealand and New Caledonia. It is similar to other tree genera from South America and New Guinea. Some botanists group it with Pilgerodendron, Austrocedrus, and Papuacedrus. However, these relationships are not as close as previously thought. There's a tree called Calocedrus in the Northern Hemisphere that was once considered part of Libocedrus, but they're not really related. The name 'Libocedrus' comes from the teardrop-shaped resin drops it produces. \nPilgerodendron is a special kind of tree, called a conifer, that belongs to a group called Cupressaceae, which are like cypress trees. There's only one tree in this group called Pilgerodendron uviferum, and it can only be found in very special forests in two countries, Chile and Argentina, near the bottom of the Earth. These forests are called Valdivian and Magellanic subpolar forests. This tree grows in a place called Tierra del Fuego, which is the southernmost part of the world where conifers grow. It's also part of a group of trees from the southern part of the world, called Callitroideae, that are friends with the plants found in Antarctica. \nCypress-pine is the name for three related tree families in the Cupressaceae family, all known as conifers. \nAjugeae is a group of plants in the Lamiaceae family, specifically part of the Teucrioideae subfamily. These plants include genera like Acrymia, Ajuga, Cymaria, Garrettia, and Holocheila. \n\nExplanation: \n- Made the language simpler by avoiding technical terms like tribe and subfamily.\n- List the genera as specific examples to clarify the point.\n- This way, it's easier for someone without botanical knowledge to understand."}], "output": "\nNo, both Cypress and Ajuga are not genera. Cypress is a genus within the Cupressaceae family, as mentioned in the passage, while Ajuga is a genus within the Lamiaceae family, specifically part of the Ajugeae subfamily.**"},

After they left, there was a new team called the Charlotte Bobcats in 2004. They picked their players in a draft too, two days after the Bobcats' big event.

She also won a gold medal with the USA World University Games Team in the same year. In 2002, she was picked 20th by the Detroit Shock in the WNBA draft and later won a championship with them. In 2005, she joined the Charlotte Sting, but when the team stopped, she was chosen again by the Los Angeles Sparks in the dispersal draft. She finished her career with the Shock in 2007. \nThe 2003 WNBA Season was the seventh one for women's basketball. It was special because some teams either left or changed their names. The Orlando Miracle moved to Connecticut and became the Connecticut Sun, while the Utah Starzz went to San Antonio and became the Silver Stars. The Miami Sol and Portland Fire didn't continue, and the Charlotte Sting was the only team without an NBA team. The games also increased from 32 to 34 per team.

She was particularly interested in Virginia Woolf, Rebecca West, and Nancy Cunard. Marcus created new ways of analyzing these writers by focusing on their social and political messages, which were often overlooked in previous criticism. She showed that Woolf's work had strong feminist, pacifist, and socialist themes, criticizing imperialism and the bourgeoisie. Even though her ideas were initially controversial and faced resistance from older scholars, her understanding of Woolf's significance in literature is now widely accepted and influential in related fields."}], "output": "\nEmma Bull was born earlier than Virginia Woolf.

The main fun events happen in a place called Dangriga, with big parades, music, and dancing that show their unique culture. \nCreole Day, also known as Jounen Kwéyòl, is a big party in Saint Lucia that happens every last Sunday of October. People have been celebrating it since 1984. On that day, the towns that host the event show off their awesome food, like roasted breadfruit, a special soup called Souse, and many other delicious dishes like fish stews. They also enjoy local drinks like Cocoa Tea and Guava Juice.\n\nThe fun doesn't stop with the food. There's music too, especially with tambos, drums that everyone beats and talks in the Creole language. People wear special clothes called Wob Dwiete or use Madras, a colorful fabric, for a more casual look.\n\nTwo places that always celebrate Creole Day are Mon Repos and Dennery. It's a time for everyone to come together, enjoy the culture, and have a good time. In the United States, from 1828 to 1861, January 8 was a special day called the Eighth, which celebrated a big victory called the Battle of New Orleans. This battle happened in 1815 when a leader named Andrew Jackson, from Tennessee, led a group of American soldiers and free people who were not slaves, and they won against the British. People in the South, where it was mostly celebrated, honored this day after the last battle of the War of 1812. In 1828, when Jackson became the President, the Eighth became an official holiday. But it stopped being one during the American Civil War that started in 1861. \nSaint-Jean-Baptiste Day, also known as National Holiday in Quebec, is a special day celebrated on June 24th. It's when we remember the birth of St. John the Baptist. In Quebec, it's a big deal, like a holiday, and the government helps by financing and organizing events from June 23rd to 24th. People in other parts of Canada and the US also celebrate it as a day to enjoy French Canadian culture. \nWhite Sunday is a fun holiday in Samoa, which happens on the second Sunday of October. It's a day when families and the whole community come together to celebrate kids. During church services, there are special activities like reading Bible stories, acting out plays, and dancing. On this day, kids get cool gifts like new clothes and school supplies, and they get to do things that grown-ups usually do, like being first to eat at family meals. \nOn December 21st, a fun event called Santo Tomas starts Christmas in the Basque Country. People go outside, dance, and enjoy a special Basque sausage called txistorra with their friends. They dress up in unique clothes called casera outfits. Girls wear long, flowy skirts, old-fashioned shirts with headscarves and aprons. Boys wear long black shirts, pants, and a black hat called txapela. The outfits are usually dark blue but can be different colors. People wear these clothes because they remind them of the mountain people who used to sell things in town and visit on this day to pay rent to their landlords."}], "output": "\nPeople of the Netherlands wear colorful clothes, particularly Wob Dwiete or use Madras, for Oranjegekte or to celebrate Koningsdag.**"},

Some well-known ones are from 1936, directed by George Cukor, which won Oscars, and from 1968, directed by Franco Zeffirelli, which had pretty young actors. There's also a 1996 movie by Baz Luhrmann, with a fast-paced style for teenagers, that was popular too. Each version had its own unique take, with Cukor using older actors and Zeffirelli featuring young ones. \nRomeo Montague, a main character in William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, is the son of Montague. He secretly marries Juliet, who comes from a different family, the Capulets. Romeo gets into trouble because of a fight where he kills Tybalt, Juliet's cousin.

Other important actors, like Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo, and Pete Postlethwaite, also appear in the movie. \nA rose, no matter its name, would still smell sweet, which is a phrase from a play called Romeo and Juliet by Shakespeare. Juliet is saying that someone's family name (in this case, Montague) doesn't change how they are as a person. People often use this to mean that names don't define what something is. In the play, Juliet compares Romeo to a rose and says he would still be beautiful and her love even if he wasn't called Romeo. This also suggests that if he weren't part of the Montague family, they could marry without any problems. \nRomeo × Juliet is an anime TV show based on a play by William Shakespeare called Romeo and Juliet.

It's in a special building called Australia House, which is very important and has been used for diplomatic work for a very long time. It's also the first embassy Australia had and has been operating the longest. \nA diplomatic mission or foreign mission is a group of people from a country or organization that goes to another country to represent their home country officially. When we talk about a diplomatic mission, we usually mean the embassy, which is the main office in the capital city of the receiving country. Embassies are the homes of diplomats. However, there are also smaller missions called consulates, not in the capital. These missions can be either in the country they represent or in other countries too, but they're not always in the capital. So, we have two types: resident embassies and non-resident embassies. \nA diplomatic bag, often called a diplomatic pouch, is a special container used by diplomats to carry important documents or items between their mission and their home country or other official places. It can come in different shapes like a box, briefcase, or even a large suitcase, and it has a lock or seal to keep it secure from non-authorized people. This bag is protected by law and can't be searched or seized without permission, as stated in a rule called article 27. It can only hold items meant for official use, and the person who carries it, called a diplomatic courier, is also immune from getting arrested. \nThe Chinese Embassy in London is a place where China's government in the UK does important work. It's the main embassy in the UK, and there are also smaller ones in Edinburgh and Manchester. It started as the Chinese Legation in 1877, which was the first official place in the UK for China to communicate. It has been representing China through different governments, like the Qing Empire, the Republic, and now the People's Republic. This embassy was where a significant event in Chinese history happened, when they kept Sun Yat-sen, a key figure in the 1911 revolution. It still hosts events for China-UK relations, like the big celebrations in 2012 for 40 years of friendship. \nThe US Embassy in Kenya, located in Nairobi, is where the US government represents the United States in Kenya. It started in 1964 when the US started diplomatic relations with the country. In 1998, a terrorist attack hit the original embassy, so they built a new one in Gigiri, a nearby area, in 2003. The embassy in Somalia is also based there. \nAzerbaijan started building diplomatic relations with other countries in the 16th century when it was part of the Safavids dynasty. However, it officially established its first diplomatic body, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in 1918 after becoming a republic. When Mehmet Hasan Hacınkski became the first minister, the parliament sent a delegation to the Ottoman State to sign the first international agreement, recognizing Azerbaijan's independence. They also signed a friendship treaty with Iran.\n\nDuring this period, Azerbaijan established a consulate in Tehran and other cities. However, their diplomatic efforts were temporarily halted when the Russian army entered Baku in 1920. After gaining independence in 1991, Azerbaijan started rebuilding its diplomatic relations and established embassies and consulates in over 70 countries. More recent missions have been opened in Brazil, Australia, and Vietnam. \nA head of mission, or COM, is the person in charge of a diplomatic office, like an ambassador or consul. They are also known as the chef de mission (CMD) from France. This role includes international organization representatives too. Sometimes, there's a second person in charge, called the deputy head of mission or DCM. They are the number two person in the diplomatic team. \nExplanation: The US Mission to the European Union (USEU) is the US government's main office in Brussels, Belgium, that deals with the EU. The US has been talking to the EU and its earlier groups, like the European Coal and Steel Community, since 1953. In 1956, they started a special office for the Community in Luxembourg.

He teaches at the University of Oslo and is the president of the European Association of Social Anthropologists from 2015-2016. He's also part of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters. \n\nExplanation: Simplified the passage by removing technical terms and providing clearer details about his profession and roles. \nSocial Anthropology/Anthropologie Sociale is a magazine that comes out every three months. It started in 2007 and is made by Wiley-Blackwell for a group in Europe called the European Association of Social Anthropologists. Before that, it was published by Cambridge University Press.

The articles can be written in English or French. \nExplanation: Network Analysis and Ethnographic Challenges: Understanding a Turkish Nomad Clan is a book written by Douglas R. White from the University of California, Irvine, and Ulla Johansen from the University of Cologne. It combines anthropology and complexity science.

He used to teach at other universities in different countries too, like Scotland, Serbia, Brazil, South Africa, and Slovenia. In 2016, he was chosen to be in charge of a book series for a European group of anthropologists. He works with Han Vermeulen to organize a group that studies the history of anthropology. \nExplanation: \n\nParticipant observation is a method used in research to gather information. It's commonly used in fields like anthropology and ethnology, but not as much in sociology, communication, geography, or psychology. The goal is to deeply understand a specific group or community, like their customs or a religious community, by spending a long time with them and observing their daily life. This method started with social anthropologists, like Bronisław Malinowski, who studied people in their natural environment in places like Britain. Some other influential figures, like Franz Boas in the US, also used this approach. \nMuted Group Theory (MGT) is a concept made by social anthropologists Edwin and Shirley Ardener in 1975. It talks about how a main group, called the dominant group, creates the rules and words for a language. People in a smaller group, called the subordinate group, have to learn and use this dominant language to express themselves. But, sometimes they may not express their thoughts clearly because of language problems. The dominant group might not listen to the smaller group either. This can make the smaller group feel unheard or muted. MGT was first made to understand how women and men are treated differently, but it can apply to any group that is quieted by their language's limitations. \nExplanation: The Association of Social Anthropologists in the UK and its member countries is a group that focuses on social studies. They help spread knowledge in this area and are part of a bigger group called the Academy of Social Sciences. \n\nSimple version: There's a group in the UK that loves studying social stuff. They help others learn about it and are part of a bigger club called the Academy of Social Sciences. \nCoral Gardens and Their Magic is a book written by Bronisław Malinowski, the last part of his trilogy about the Trobriand Islanders. It's about how the people in the Trobriand Islands, who grow things like yams, taro, bananas, and palms, use their gardens not just for food, but also as beautiful creations. Alfred Gell said in 1988 that it's still the best book on how primitive societies combine technology and magic. Many people think of it as Malinowski's most important work."}], "output": "\nAlfred Gell and Edmund Leach were both British social anthropologists.**"},

They were initially published in The London Journal and later in The British Journal as Essays on Liberty, Civil, and Religious. These essays became very important and helped form the basis of the Commonwealthman idea, which influenced the Country Party's thoughts. Gordon's ideas were significant in the development of republicanism in both Britain and the American colonies, especially during the time before the American Revolution. A historian named Zuckert says that John Trenchard and Gordon, writing under the name Cato in the early 18th century, were key in combining ideas for the new republicanism. \nThe New Haven Documentary Film Festival, also called NHdocs, is a yearly event in June where people watch documentaries at two places in New Haven, Connecticut.

It was the first time all Test-playing nations played in a tournament apart from the big World Cups. Four teams, India, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Indies, made it to the semi-finals. South Africa won the first semi-final against Sri Lanka by 92 runs, but because of rain, each innings was only 39 overs long. In the second semi, West Indies beat India by 6 wickets and went on to play in the final. There were 11 teams, including Test and ODI nations, participating in the 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy, a cricket event. It took place in Kenya from October 3 to 15. In the first round, ODI teams like Kenya and Zimbabwe played against India and Sri Lanka. India and Sri Lanka easily won their matches. England won against Bangladesh in the next round. New Zealand, who had never won an ICC event before, emerged as champions by defeating India in the final by 4 wickets. \nLindum Sports Club Ground is a place in Lincoln, Lincolnshire where cricket games are played. The first game here was in 1861 with a team called Lincolnshire playing against a team from everywhere.

In the 21st century, they sometimes used this place to play their games, but the last time they did so was in 2000 against Cumberland. In 1996, the first MCCA Knockout Trophy match was held here, and they had four matches until 2007. The last match in this competition was played between Lincolnshire and Staffordshire at this ground. \nGuy Philip Randall-Johnson, born on December 8, 1959, in Crediton, Devon, was a former English cricketer and umpire. He started his cricket career playing for Devon in Minor counties matches from 1987 to 1991. In 1993, he began officiating as an umpire in Minor Counties Championship games. His first List A match was in the 1999 NatWest Trophy between Somerset and Bedfordshire.\n\nBetween 1999 and 2003, he umpired in 7 List A matches, including the last one in 2003 for the Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy. Until 2008, he continued to work in Minor counties cricket, officiating in 54 Championship games and 25 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches.\n\nIn 2006, he made headlines for leaving a game after being abused by Berkshire players for giving their captain, Julian Wood, out lbw. Despite not getting an apology, he walked off, and other players had to take his place.\n\nIn summary, Guy Randall-Johnson was a Devonian cricketer who transitioned into umpiring, officiating in Minor counties and List A matches until 2008, and gained attention for standing up to player misconduct. In 1998, there were 9 teams (from Test cricket countries) for the ICC KnockOut Trophy, the first Champions Trophy. It took place in Bangladesh from October 24 to November 2. Teams could have a bigger group of 30 players, but for the tournament, they needed to have a smaller group of 14. Only New Zealand and Zimbabwe played in a pre-quarterfinal.

It was made in the 1200s by people called the Counts of Nevers. They owned it until the 1800s. It was a special home for important people, like Peter II, who was the Emperor of Constantinople, and his daughter Matilda, who was a Countess. They both lived there often. \nHeaven, or Shamayim in Hebrew, is one part of the three-part world: Shamayim is where God and other gods live, Earth (Eretz) is where people live and are alive, and Sheol is where the dead, including the good ones, go. \nIn Norse mythology, Andlang is a place mentioned as the second sky realm, located between the first one with gods' halls and the third, called Vídbláin. There are nine heavens in total, as told by Snorri. After a big event called Ragnarök, Andlang will be a place where dead souls will stay and rest. \nThe Tabernacle, or mishkan, was a special tent made of curtains and wood, designed to be God's home while the Israelites were traveling in the desert and later when they conquered a land. It had gold decorations and was shown to Moses at Mount Sinai, with specific instructions. They carried it with them and later, a bigger temple called Solomon's Temple replaced it as the place where God lived. \nIn simple terms, an inquiline is an animal that lives in the home or space of another animal, like a guest. This can happen with insects that live in the tunnels of gophers or ants and termites that share their nests with many different species. Inquiline animals don't harm the host species, while parasites do. They are similar but not exactly the same thing. \nExplanation: In Norse stories, Víðbláinn is the third sky in a place called Gylfaginning, made by Snorri. It's way up above two other places, Andlang and Asgard. After a big event called Ragnarök, this sky will be a home for the souls of people who have passed away. \nThe oldest synagogue in the UK can be a bit tricky to identify. Some synagogues that existed even before Jews were forced out of England have been found in buildings that were used for other purposes for a long time. After Jews were allowed back in the 17th century, there are also newer synagogues. Sometimes, a synagogue has been rebuilt on the same site, so the building might not be as old as the history. Some old synagogues have been changed or disappeared and are now used for different things, like churches or schools. But there are also some that have been continuously used as synagogues for many years. \nThe claim that a synagogue is the oldest in the world can be tricky to determine. Many old synagogues have been found in places that were once built, but some have been rebuilt or have had parts replaced over time. This means that while the place might be very old, the building itself might not be. Some old synagogues have been turned into churches, mosques, or used for other reasons. However, there are also some that have been used as synagogues without stopping for a long time."}], "output": "\nThe dwelling place of the dead, as mentioned in the passage about Heaven or Shamayim in Hebrew, Sheol in Norse mythology, and the third sky realm in Norse stories, has been built for an indefinite period, as it refers to a place where the dead, including the good ones, go.

This tune is also used for other songs like Lazy Mary, Will You Get Up, and The Wheels on the Bus. \nHere We Go Round the Mulberry Bush is a song by Traffic, a band.

When it came out in 1967, people liked it and it made it to the top 10 in the UK. The Beatles even wanted to use a video of the band doing the song for their movie Magical Mystery Tour, but it didn't end up in the final version. Now, you can watch it on a special DVD or Blu-ray for the movie from 2012. \nMichael Finnegan, sometimes spelled as Michael Finnagen or Michael Vinnegan, is a very long song that can go on and on without ending.

It has the chemical formula CHOH or CHO and is sometimes called dimethyl carbinol or i-PrOH, but it's a mistake to call it that. It's a simple type of alcohol where a propyl group is attached to a hydroxyl group, making it a secondary alcohol with one carbon attached to two others. It's similar to 1-propanol but has different structure. It's widely used in various things like cleaning products, disinfectants, and antiseptics. \nAlcohol is a type of chemical that has a -OH group, or hydroxyl, connected to a carbon atom. It can be part of bigger groups with other carbon or hydrogen atoms. A simple type of alcohol has a simple shape with only one chain and is called a cyclic alcohol, with the general formula CHOH. Ethanol, which is also called alcohol, is the type found in drinks like beer and wine. When we talk about alcohol, we usually mean ethanol. Things about alcohol can be found in articles that talk about it. \nTHPC, or Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride, is a special kind of chemical made from phosphorus and chlorine. It has the name [P(CHOH)]Cl because it has a part called P(CHOH) that is connected to four other parts, which is common for phosphorus salts. People use it to create materials that help stop fires. \n1-Hexanol is a clear liquid with 6 carbon atoms in its structure, like this: CH(CH)OH. It's not very soluble in water, but it can mix with things like diethyl ether and ethanol. There are two other similar liquids called 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, which are different because the water part (hydroxyl) is in a different place. Many other liquids with the same formula, CHOH, exist too. It's used to make perfumes. \n1-Pentanol, also known as n-pentanol or pentan-1-ol, is a type of alcohol that has 5 carbon atoms. Its chemical formula is CHOH. It's a colorless liquid that smells bad. It's the simple form of a bigger alcohol called amyl alcohol, which exists in 8 different versions with the same formula. \nAldonic acids are sugar acids created when a sugar, called an aldose, loses an aldehyde group and gets a carboxylic acid group instead. They have a simple structure: HOOC-(CHOH)-CHOH. If only the end part with a hydroxyl group (OH) is changed, it makes uronic acids, but if both ends are changed, it forms aldaric acids. \nXylitol is a sweet thing we use instead of sugar. It comes from wood, so its name has wood and sugar in it. It's like a sugar that's not sugar, called a polyalcohol or sugar alcohol. It's a special shape, like pentane, but doesn't matter which way it spins. Scientists found out that xylitol can help fix teeth that are starting to fall apart. Also, it can help kids with ear infections if they use it in things like gum or lozenges. \nWhen you mix a dielectric (like glass) with a metal, the way they conduct electricity (formula_1) and how they hold charges (dielectric constant, formula_2) changes at a special point called the percolation threshold. If the metal part is a lot, the conductivity changes smoothly between the dielectric and metal levels. We can describe this with two special numbers, s and t. But, as we get closer to the threshold, the dielectric constant starts to grow very fast. To understand this frequency dependence, we use a model called R-C (resistor-capacitor)."}], "output": "\nThe component of shellite with the formula (ON)CHOH is not mentioned in the provided passage.

Lanny Wadkins, who was 27, won the big tournament, which was his first major win. He beat Gene Littler in a special game called a sudden-death playoff. This was the first time a playoff happened at the PGA Championship in 10 years, and it was the first time ever in a major championship where players had to play extra holes to decide the winner. The last time something like this happened in a stroke-play major was in 1941. \nThe 1940 PGA Championship was a golf competition that took place from August 26 to September 2 at a place called Hershey Country Club in Hershey, Pennsylvania. It was the 23rd event of its kind. The winner, Byron Nelson, became the champion by beating Sam Snead in a match play competition. This win was Nelson's first PGA Championship.

This law, called the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, was made to make things clear about how it works for condominiums. It was created in 1968 to help protect people from fake land deals when buying across state lines. The law asks sellers to share important details about the land in a Property Report.

A new bill, H.R. 2600, is trying to change some parts of this law for condominiums. \nMisconduct by a lawyer is when they do something wrong or break the rules. This can happen in a few ways: if they represent someone for the wrong reasons, charge too much, lie to their client, hide important information, stop helping them, don't share all the facts, argue a point without mentioning previous laws that could make their argument weaker, or even have a sexual relationship with the client. \nThe Modernization of Investigative Techniques Act (MITA) was a bill introduced in Canada in 2005 to update how police can get information from phone and internet companies.

The first person to have this title was a man named Gospatric II, who was related to Gospatric, who was an earl in a different place called Northumbria. His son, George de Dunbar, became the 11th Earl of March, but in 1435, the government took away his titles and land because of something he did. George's son, Patrick, kept a small piece of land in a place called Kilconquhar in Fife. \nGeorge de Dunbar, who was the 11th Earl of Dunbar and Lord of Annandale and the Isle of Man, lived between 1370 and 1457.

He passed away due to cancer in Dupont, Washington, at the age of 64. \nIn 1531, Bishop Gavin Dunbar, also known as the Elder, started Bishop Dunbar's Hospital. He got money for it by giving up some of his things before he died. The King, James V of Scotland, said okay to this plan in a special paper called a charter. The hospital was near a church but not in the cemetery. It was also known as St Mary's Hospital.\n\nThe hospital helped people by supporting Bedesmen, who were like helpers. They got their name from a prayer called Bede. The hospital residents would pray together in special prayers called Divine Office. A place called the Bede House in Old Aberdeen was used by the Bedesmen until the 19th century.\n\nThe original hospital building from 1531 is now only seen in a part of a park wall in Old Aberdeen.

Before it was called this, the album was called Take That Society or Skin Deep. \nThe song We Bring an Arsenal was supposed to be the second one from Lostprophets' fifth album, Weapons. It was supposed to come out on June 4, 2012. In the US, people could hear it on rock radio since then, but in the UK, it's not out yet. This is because the singer, Ian Watkins, went to jail in 2013. People first heard it live in Brisbane, Australia, on February 25, 2012. \nSaliva's eighth album, titled In It to Win It, came out in 2013.

It's in a place called Dras, close to a hill called Tololing. You can find it 5 kilometers away from the city center, on a big road called Srinagar-Leh Highway 1D. The memorial has a big message with names of all the people who died. On July 26, there's a special day called Kargil Vijay Diwas to honor them. The Prime Minister visits a similar place in Delhi too. The most interesting part is the Sandstone wall with names, and you can even see some mountains the Indian army won back from Pakistan. There's a big flag that celebrates the 13th year of India's win. \nThe Devon County War Memorial is a special statue made during World War 1 to remember people who died from Devon, England. It was made by a famous architect named Sir Edwin Lutyens and is in Exeter, a city in the south-west of England. This memorial is one of 15 similar ones Lutyens created and is unique because it's in a city instead of a church. At first, they wanted to build a special area at the cathedral for the war dead, but they couldn't do it because they didn't have enough money. They decided to make a War Cross instead. They found the perfect place for it on the cathedral green. There was also a separate memorial being planned for Exeter, but the groups in charge didn't talk to each other, so both the cathedral's memorial and the one in Northernhay Gardens were built. \nThe Manchester Cenotaph is a big memorial in Manchester, England, that honors people from the First World War.

They wanted to put it in Albert Square, but some artists didn't like that idea. Then they thought about Piccadilly Gardens, but they wanted to hurry. So, they chose St Peter's Square, even though there was already a cross there from a church. They couldn't move the cross, so the memorial was built with it right where it was. \nExplanation: The York City War Memorial is a special structure made to remember people who fought in the First World War. It was made by a famous architect, Sir Edwin Lutyens, and is in York, a city in England. In 1919, people thought about how to remember the war dead, but they had different ideas. Some wanted a useful thing, not just a big statue. After a meeting, they decided on a statue. Lutyens was chosen to design it, and he also worked on a similar one for the North Eastern Railway.\n\nBut, there were problems. Some people didn't like the designs because they didn't look good with the old buildings in the city and the railway memorial was too big. They asked for a change, so the group moved the memorial to a new place outside the city walls. Lutyens made a new design with just a cross, but they couldn't afford the full plan because of money problems. \nThe Spalding War Memorial is a special statue for people who fought in the First World War. It's in a park called Ayscoughfee Hall in a place called Spalding, England. A man named Sir Edwin Lutyens, who is good at designing buildings, made a plan for it.

It has a bulb inside a strong, protective cage with a handle that joins both. The handle can even have a built-in electrical outlet, making it a dual-purpose tool with a long cord for reaching far. \n\n Simplified: This is a light with a strong cage around the bulb and a handle. It's tough and can reach from far, and it has a socket on the handle so it can work as both a light and an extension cord. \nThe Hefner lamp, also known as Hefnerkerze in German, is a light bulb used for measuring light in photometry. It uses amyl acetate to produce the flame. \nThe carbon button lamp is a simple light bulb created by Nikola Tesla. It has a tiny carbon ball in the middle of a glass bulb without any air. To work, it needs very fast, on and off current, maybe from a special high-frequency current. This makes a small electric arc or vacuum arc near the carbon. When the carbon gets very hot, it glows.

In trade journals, the genus is simply referred to as Bro. \nWilliam Nicholls, born on July 23, 1885 and passed away on March 10, 1951, was an Australian botanist who loved orchids. He was really good at taking photos and painting them. He wrote many articles about orchids for a magazine called The Victorian Naturalist, and he even discovered new ones. He wanted to create a big book with pictures of all Australian orchids, but he didn't finish it before he died. After he died, they combined his work into one book called Orchids of Australia in 1969. Some of the orchid species he found and named include: Caladenia caudata, Caladenia echidnachila, and so on. \nOtaara, often shortened as Otr in gardening, is a special type of orchid that is made by mixing plants from different families. It includes genes from Brassavola, Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia, and Sophronitis. \nDuck orchids, also called Paracaleana, are a type of pretty flowers in the Orchidaceae family. They grow in Australia and New Zealand, but not in the northern part of Australia. They look a bit like Caleana major, but their flowers and the insects that help them reproduce are different. These flowers are not very showy, having just one green leaf and a few not-so-colorful flowers that are hard to notice. They also need male thynnid wasps for pollination, like hammer orchids (Drakaea). \nSpider orchids, also known as Caladenia, are a type of 350 plant species in the Orchidaceae family. They are small, ground-dwelling plants with a single leaf and stem that have a fuzzy texture. The flower's lower part, called the labellum, has edges that look like fringes or have small bumps called calli. These flowers have special features to attract specific insects for pollination.\n\nSpider orchids are grouped into three categories - spider orchids, zebra orchids, and cowslip orchids - but people also use other names. Most of them are native to Australia, and a remarkable 136 species can be found in Western Australia, making it the place with the most spider orchid species. \nCalochilus, also called beard orchids, is a group of about 30 plant species in the Orchidaceae family. These plants are small, growing on land with just one leaf at the base, or no leaves at all. What makes them unique is the hairy lip, which gives them their name. Unlike some other orchids in Australia, beard orchids don't use baby plant parts (daughter tubers) to reproduce. Instead, they self-pollinate when they can't be crossed with other plants. Most of these species are found in Australia, but some can be found in neighboring places like New Zealand, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. \nCattleyonia, a type of orchid, is made from parents from two genera, Cattleya and Broughtonia. This hybrid is called Ctna when people talk about gardening. \nHawkinsara, often shortened to Hknsa, is a special kind of orchid that is made by mixing plants from different families. These families include Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia, and Sophronitis. In simple words, it's a hybrid of these four types of orchids in gardening."}], "output": "\nYes, both Broughtonia and Laeliocattleya are orchids. They are mentioned in the passage as being part of the mix in the orchid species Otaara, which is a hybrid that includes genes from Brassavola, Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia, and Sophronitis.**"},

On the day the World Cup started after 23 years, there were two ceremonies happening at the same time. One was in a park called North Hagley Park in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the other was in Melbourne, Australia. Many people came to watch both ceremonies because they were big events. It was the first big sports event in Christchurch since a very sad earthquake happened there in 2011. \nOrvar Bergmark, born on November 16, 1930 and passed away on May 10, 2004, was a Swedish football player and coach. He was the second person in charge of the Swedish national soccer team. In 1970, he successfully led the team to the FIFA World Cup in Mexico, which was the first time in 12 years for Sweden. This was also the first time in 20 years that Sweden qualified for a World Cup, despite not needing to qualify because they hosted the 1958 World Cup. Previously, Sweden had not qualified for the World Cups in 1954, 1962, and 1966. \nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup was a big soccer event that happened in South Korea and Japan from May 31 to June 30. It was the first time a World Cup was in Asia, not Europe or America. Some special rules happened during this World Cup, and Brazil won for the fifth time, beating Germany in the final. Because of that, Brazil got to play in another big soccer event called the Confederations Cup. Turkey finished third, which was their second time in the World Cup. Some teams like China PR, Ecuador, Senegal, and Slovenia were playing in it for the first time. Republic of Ireland, Russia, and Sweden, who didn't play in 1998, came back to join the fun. \nThe 1991 Rugby World Cup was the second one, held in England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, and France. These five European countries, which were part of the Five Nations Championship, were the first to host a Rugby World Cup in the northern hemisphere. It was a big event after the first one in 1987. For the first time, they had to choose teams through qualifying competitions because there were 33 countries trying to join, up from 16 in the previous one. Only Western Samoa, instead of Tonga, got to join because they qualified. The same way of playing, with a 16-team group and then elimination rounds, was used, but with a few small changes in how points were counted. \nThe Ukraine's National Football Team, also known as the Ukrainian team, is controlled by the Football Federation of Ukraine. After Ukraine became independent from the Soviet Union, they played their first game on April 29, 1992, against Hungary. Their biggest achievement was reaching the quarter-finals in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which was their first time in a major championship. As the host country, Ukraine automatically got into UEFA Euro 2012. In 2016, they qualified for Euro 2016, which was a big deal because they qualified through the regular play-offs for the first time. This was a first for Ukraine, as they had never won a play-off before, even though they tried in other important tournaments like Euro 2000, 2002 World Cup, 2010 World Cup, and 2014 World Cup. \nIn the 1968-1969 season of football in Belgium, the 66th one, Standard Club Liégeois won their 4th Division I title. However, no Belgian team could advance past the second round of European competitions. Six clubs did make it to the second round, which was a new record. K Lierse SK won the cup by beating RR White 2-0. The Belgium national team did well too, finishing first in their World Cup qualifying group and qualified for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico, which was their first major tournament appearance since the 1954 World Cup. \nThe Tertiary Student Rugby League World Cup, or University Rugby League World Cup, started in 1986 in New Zealand. It was the first time a World Cup for universities happened, and all five countries that had test teams (the top-level ones) played. This was the first non-major World Cup organized by the Rugby League International Federation. \nThe Switzerland women's soccer team plays in international games. They started in 1972 and recently tried to get to the 2015 Women's World Cup. They did really well and made it their first time in that tournament. At the same time, the men's team also qualified for a World Cup, which was a first. In 2017, they qualified for the European Championship.

We made a list of these units and commanders using information from the army's structure during the battle, the reports of casualties, and separate Union order of battle. \nThe Seven Days Battles during the American Civil War were fought by these Union Army units and their leaders. We got the list of who fought by looking at the army's records of who was there and who got hurt. The Confederacy's units are listed separately. \nOn June 8, 1862, there was a big fight called the Battle of Cross Keys in a place called Rockingham County, Virginia. This fight was part of a plan by a Confederate general named Stonewall Jackson during a time called the American Civil War. The important thing is, after this battle and another one the next day at Port Republic, Stonewall Jackson's plan worked. The Union armies had to go away, and he could use his troops to help another general, Lee, in a big fight near Richmond, Virginia. \nThe Battle of Gaines's Mill, also called First Battle of Cold Harbor or Chickahominy River fight, happened on June 27, 1862, in Virginia. It was part of a series of seven fights during a big event called the Peninsula Campaign in the American Civil War. The day before, there was a fight at Beaver Dam Creek that didn't go well. The Confederates, led by General Robert E. Lee, tried to attack the Union Army's side that was far away on the north side of the Chickahominy River. They had a big group of around 57,000 soldiers in six groups. Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter and his group, called the V Corps, had a strong defense line. The Confederates tried to attack but didn't do it well, causing a lot of hurt to their side. Even when Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's group arrived, they couldn't attack right away because of some delays, so the Union Army got some help from another group, the VI Corps. \nSavage's Station was a special place during the American Civil War where the Army of the Potomac got supplies, had a hospital, and had their main office. It was in Henrico County, Virginia, close to a train line. But, the people who now own the train tracks, the Norfolk Southern Railroad, don't have any records of a station there. They do remember a house near the tracks, which was used as a hospital during a big battle. General George B. McClellan used it as his office too. Sadly, the house was burned by soldiers in 1864 and never rebuilt. There's now nothing left, but a small old cemetery is still near the spot. In the 1930s, there was even a smokehouse there, but it's not there anymore. \nThe Battle of Port Republic took place on June 9, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, during the American Civil War. It was a very important fight between two strong armies. This was the most expensive battle for General Stonewall Jackson's Army of the Valley during their trip through the Shenandoah Valley. The battle and another one at Cross Keys the day before were the final wins for Jackson's campaign. These victories made the Union armies leave and go back, and Jackson could then help General Lee outside Richmond, Virginia, with no problems. \nThe Northern Virginia Campaign, also called the Second Bull Run or Second Manassas, was a war event in Virginia from August to September in 1862. It happened in the Eastern part of the United States during the Civil War. Confederate General Robert Lee continued to win after some battles in the Peninsula Campaign by going towards Washington D.C. and beating the Army of Virginia led by Maj. Gen. John Pope. \nThe Battle of Malvern Hill, or Poindexter's Farm, was a fight between two armies during the American Civil War. It happened on July 1, 1862. One army, led by General Robert E. Lee, was from the Confederate side, and the other, led by Major General George B. McClellan, was from the Union. This was the last battle in a series called the Seven Days Battles. The battle happened on a high ground, called Malvern Hill, not far from Richmond, Virginia, which was the Confederate capital. It was just a short 1.6 kilometers from the James River. About fifty thousand soldiers from each side fought, and they used a lot of big guns, over two hundred of them, and even had three ships involved."}], "output": "\nThe Battle of Manila was fought earlier in our nation's history.**"},

However, there's a problem - the FBI is looking into it for possible corruption, which caused the leader of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, to step down. Surprisingly, Qatar, with only 2 million people, will be the first Arab country to host the世界杯. \nIn 2009, Russia said it wanted to host the FIFA World Cup. They asked FIFA by the deadline. President Vladimir Putin, who really wanted this, asked Vitaly Mutko, the sports minister, to help with the plan. Mutko, who was also in charge of the Russian Football Union, said Russia would spend a lot of money, about $10 billion, on the event. The team working on the bid had people like RFU CEO Sorokin and a man named Alexander Djordjadze. In 2010, Russia decided not to try for 2022, but in December 2010, they were chosen to host the 2018 World Cup. \nThe Indonesia FIFA World Cup bid was the first time PSSI, the football association, tried to host the big世界杯 event. In 2010, FIFA said no because the government didn't help. Four Asian countries were trying to get the世界杯, but Indonesia was one of them.

If successful, it would have been Japan's second time hosting the World Cup, their first alone since 2002 when they shared it with South Korea.

In March 2009, they started asking countries to say if they wanted to host. Thirteen countries tried, but one dropped out and another was not good enough. Nine countries were left, and some only wanted 2022, while the others wanted both. Europe's bids for 2018 were all gone by then. England, Russia, Belgium and Netherlands, and Portugal and Spain were the ones left for 2018. For 2022, Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the US tried. Indonesia couldn't do it because the government didn't support it, and Mexico didn't because of money problems. \nThe KFA, or Korea Football Association, tried to get the 2022 World Cup. If they succeeded, it would have been their second time hosting the big event, and it would have been the first time they did it alone, not with Japan like in 2002. The leader, Han Sung-joo, even wanted to include North Korea if they won. \nThe US Soccer team tried to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup. They first said they would in 2007. In 2009, they decided to also bid for 2022. In 2010, they stopped for 2018 and put all their effort into 2022. In December 2010, Qatar got the chance to host.

There are three species: S. goodwini from New Mexico, S. buchholtzae from Montana, and S. edmontonense from Canada. The name Sphaerotholus comes from Greek words for ball and dome because its skull is shaped like a dome. These dinosaurs lived for a long time, about 7-8 million years, and were found in many places. In 2002, scientists described how they can tell Sphaerotholus apart from other pachycephalosaurs by looking at a special feature on the back of their skull. They think Sphaerotholus is a very advanced type of pachycephalosaur. \nOryctodromeus, a small dinosaur, was called a digging runner. It lived during the middle age of the earth, around 95 million years ago, in places like Montana and Idaho in the US. It belonged to a group of fast-running dinosaurs that ate plants.

It was found in a rock layer called the Lakota Formation. In 1989, scientists named it Iguanodon lakotaensis. But, people have been arguing if it's closer to a different dinosaur called Iguanodon bernissartensis or a group called Theiophytalia. David Norman thinks it's the same dinosaur. In 2008, another scientist, Gregory S. Paul, decided to give Dakotadon its own name because of the confusion."}], "output": "\nDinosaur, specifically Cryptoraptor, came out first.**"},

Jimmy Carter, who used to be the governor of Georgia, won as the surprise candidate, along with his partner Walter Mondale, a senator from Minnesota. They were from the Democratic team, and they beat Gerald Ford, who was the president at the time, and Bob Dole, a senator from Kansas, who were representing the Republicans. \nThe 2012 US presidential election was the 57th one. It happened on November 6, 2012. Barack Obama, who was already the president, and his helper Joe Biden, from the Democratic team, won and became president again. They won against Mitt Romney, who was from Massachusetts and was the Republican's nominee, and his helper, Paul Ryan, who later became the House Speaker. \nThe next US presidential election, happening on November 8, 2044, will be the 65th one. People will vote for people who will choose the president and vice president. Before that, there will be primary elections and meetings in the first part of 2044. These events are like choosing representatives for a party's big meeting, and they decide who the party's president will be. \nIn简单易懂的话：The United States will have its presidential election on November 3, 2020, which will be the 59th time this happens. People will vote for people called electors who will choose the president and vice president. Before that, there will be some voting for party nominees from March to June. This way of choosing a president is called an indirect election because people vote for party leaders who choose the nominee. \nThe 1968 US presidential race was the 46th one. It happened on November 5th, 1968. Richard Nixon, who was the Republican candidate, won the election from Hubert Humphrey, who was the Democratic candidate and the incumbent Vice President. Some people say this election was a big change because it ended the New Deal way of politics, which had been in charge for 36 years. \nThe 1960 US presidential race was the 44th one. It took place on November 8, 1960. The Republicans chose Richard Nixon, who was already the Vice President, and the Democrats picked John F. Kennedy, a senator from Massachusetts. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was already in charge, couldn't run again because he had been President for two terms, which is the most allowed by a rule called the Twenty-second Amendment. This election was special because people in Alaska and Hawaii, which became states that year, could vote for the first time. \nThe 1964 United States presidential election was the 45th one. It happened on November 3, 1964. Lyndon B. Johnson, who became president after JFK was killed, won because people liked him and his connection to Kennedy. He got 61.1% of the votes, which is the highest since 1820. This election was very one-sided, with Johnson getting more votes than anyone else since then. In terms of electoral votes, it was the tenth most unequal. No one has won as much since then. Only a few other presidents, like Lincoln, FDR, Nixon, and Reagan, had larger victories by electoral margin. \nThe US election in 1892 was the 27th time leaders were picked. It was like the one four years before, where President Grover Cleveland, who was from the Democratic Party, and President Benjamin Harrison, from the Republican Party, both tried to get re-elected. In 1888, Cleveland won the people's vote but lost in the special voting part. This time, Cleveland won both and became the first person in the United States to have two non-consecutive terms as president. A new group called the Populist Party, made by farmers and workers, also joined and won in five states in the West."}], "output": "\nThe 58th quadrennial American presidential election held after the 2016 Michigan Democratic primary was the 2020 United States presidential election, which took place on November 3, 2020.**"},

This culture combined Roman and Celtic traditions because the Britons were already living there. Even after the Romans left in the 5th century, there was still a type of culture in southern Britain that lasted until the Anglo-Saxons came in around AD 597. They wrote in a Latin-like language called vernacular Latin during that time.\n\n Simplified: The culture in Britain during Roman times had parts from both the Romans and the local Britons. After the Romans left in the 5th century, there was a special culture in southern Britain that survived and used a Latin-like language until the Anglo-Saxons arrived in the 6th century. \nThe history of Wales started a long time ago when people first came to the area. Neanderthals lived in Wales over 230,000 years ago, and humans arrived around 31,000 BC. Modern humans have lived continuously in Wales since around 9,000 BC, leaving behind artifacts from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age. During the Iron Age, the people who lived there spoke a language called Brittonic and were part of a group called Celtic Britons. The Romans came to Wales in the 400s and by 79 had defeated the Ordovices, taking control of the region. After the Romans left in the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons invaded, and the Brittonic language and culture began to change. The Welsh people, who were a big part of this group, started to develop their own identity separate from other Brittonic-speaking peoples by the 11th century. \nThe Durotriges were a group of people from a Celtic culture in Britain before the Romans arrived. They lived in places like Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, and Devon, especially on the east side of the River Axe. In 2009, they were found in a place called Shalfleet on an island called the Isle of Wight. After the Romans took over, two main towns named Durnovaria (Dorchester) and Lindinis (Ilchester) grew. Dorchester was the main city, and Ilchester became more important. They lived next to the Dumnonii to the west and the Belgae to the east. \nThe Corieltauvi, also called Coritani, lived in Britain before the Romans came. After the Romans arrived, they became part of the Roman Britain system. They lived in a place now called the English East Midlands. They were surrounded by other groups like the Brigantes, Cornovii, Dobunni, Catuvellauni, and Iceni. Their main city was called Ratae Corieltauvorum, which is now called Leicester. \nIn the year AD 43, which started on a Tuesday according to the Julian calendar, it was called the Year of the Consulship of Caesar and Vitellius. Sometimes, it's also referred to as 796 Ab urbe condita. People started using the phrase AD 43 in the early Middle Ages, when the way to name years, called the Anno Domini system, became more common in Europe. \nThe Roman conquest of Britain started around 43 AD when Emperor Claudius sent his general, Aulus Plautius, to lead. This was not a sudden event, but a gradual process. Before this, Rome had tried to invade Britain many times, even before Julius Caesar's visits in 55 and 54 BC. Britain had been trading and talking with the Romans for over a hundred years. The Romans' influence on Britain's economy and culture, especially in the south, was already strong during the late pre-Roman Iron Age. \nThe Sussex chicken is a type of chicken from England that was first found around the time the Romans came to Britain in 43 AD. It's known for being good for both eggs and as a pet in gardens. There are eight different colors for the regular size chickens, and even smaller ones called bantams, which are also eight colors and half the size. \nEngland has been inhabited for over 800,000 years, as shown by Flint tools and footprints found in Norfolk. In 1927, a very old human jawbone was found in Devon, which was recently dated between 41,000 and 44,000 years old. People have lived in England continuously since around 13,000 years ago, during the Creswellian period. The area has lots of old remains from the Stone Age, Neolithic, and Bronze Age, like Stonehenge and Avebury.\n\nDuring the Iron Age, starting around 1000 BC, the Britons, a group of Celtic people, lived in England, especially in the southeast. The Romans conquered Britain in AD 43 and controlled the area until the early 5th century."}], "output": "\nCeltic Britons.**"},

Right now, a person named John J. Flanagan, who is a Republican, represents this district. John Flanagan is also the leader and temporary president of the whole group of senators in New York. \nNesting is when we divide voting areas for one group of elected people to create the voting areas for another group. Imagine in California, there are 80 people in the lower house, called the Assembly, each representing a small part of the state. And there are 40 people in the higher house, called the Senate, also representing smaller parts. If we first make the Assembly districts and then join two to make Senate districts, or vice versa, we're using nesting. But if we make both groups' districts separately, we don't use nesting. \nThe California State Senate is a part of the California State Legislature. California has a big population but not many lawmakers, which means each senator represents more people than each US congressperson represents. In the US House, there are 53 people representing California, each looking after about 704,566 people. But in the Senate, there are 40 senators, each taking care of about 931,349 people. That's like each senator representing a bigger area than a whole Delaware state.

It was spoken around the first century CE and was a little different from other Germanic languages. This language can be found in the oldest inscriptions from a time called the Elder Futhark, which was around the 2nd to 8th centuries.

This yoga style focuses on making everyone, including animals, equal and helping people find enlightenment by being kind and protecting the environment. It teaches that to be truly happy, one must prioritize the well-being of all beings. Jivamukti yoga also suggests a vegan diet to minimize harm to the earth and others.\n\nThe core belief in Jivamukti is 'shunyata', meaning everything is connected and comes from our perception. The idea is that to change the world, start with changing yourself and your thoughts. This leads to a non-judgmental and responsible approach, where one's actions affect others and their own self-perception.\n\nGannon believes that treating others well leads to how others treat you, which in turn influences how you see yourself, and ultimately, who you are. \nSyd Barrett, a musician from England, created many songs while he was a part of the rock band Pink Floyd.

It's a big plan that includes lots of treatments from different experts. It's based on scientific research and is meant for people who are still having trouble even after usual medical help. This plan can happen in many places and might use medicine too, depending on the person's situation. It's all about making their life better. \nThe Journal of Thoracic Disease is a medical journal that talks about lung problems. It started in 2009 and comes out once a month. It's published by AME Publishing Company and is part of big groups like a research lab, a hospital, and a society. The person in charge is Zhong Nanshan from a lung disease research center. In 2016, people who study journal influence say it's important because it has an impact factor of 2.365. \nThe ITS, or Irish Thoracic Society, is a group for doctors, nurses, and other health care workers in Ireland who look after people with breathing problems. They can be from different areas like chest doctors, general doctors, kids' doctors, or even scientists. They all work together, no matter if they're in the north or south, to take care of respiratory diseases. \nSARS is a sickness caused by a virus that started in animals and affects breathing. It happened in China in 2002-2003 and spread to 37 countries, making 8,098 people sick and 774 of them died. Most cases were in Hong Kong. Good news is, there have been no SARS cases since 2004. \nExplanation: Chronic Respiratory Disease is a magazine that comes out every three months and talks about research on breathing problems. It covers topics like chronic bronchitis, when you can't breathe properly, and sleep apnea. The people in charge are Mike Morgan from Glenfield Hospital, Carolyn Rochester from Yale University, and Sally Singh also from Glenfield Hospital. It started in 2004 and the company that publishes it is called SAGE Publications. \nExplanation: \n\nSARS stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. It's a sickness that comes from a virus, and this virus affects our breathing when it's passed from animals to people. \nFeline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is a sickness that makes cats have trouble breathing and lungs. It's caused by a virus called feline herpesvirus 1. Some people call it feline influenza or feline coryza, but those names don't really mean the same thing. It's very common in places where lots of cats live together, like cages or shelters. FVR is a big reason why cats get respiratory problems, and it happens all over the world. Another important thing to know is that feline calicivirus can also cause breathing issues in cats. \nChronic infections with Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia can cause asthma, making the airways inflamed and producing more mucus. Children who get very sick with viral respiratory infections like RSV or HRV early on are more likely to have asthma later. RSV can raise the risk of asthma in young kids but the connection weakens with age. HRV often causes bronchiolitis and is strongly linked to asthma. Viral URI infections, especially HRV, can worsen asthma in people with the disease. So, these germs, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and HRV, are important in non-atopic asthma."}], "output": "\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).**"},

Even though the policy itself doesn't say they must do this, in California, if they don't accept a reasonable settlement that is within the policy limits, they can be responsible for the full amount the insured has to pay, even if it's more than the policy covers. This is because if they refuse to settle, they might be in a situation where they want to deny coverage, but they still have to consider if the offer is reasonable. The company must tell the insured about any settlement offers and not pressure them to give more than they should. If they do that, the company could be in trouble. \nMana Al Otaiba was born on May 15, 1946, to Saeed Al Otaiba in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Not much is known about his personal life.

It started as a weak disturbance near Fiji on May 1st, and then slowly became stronger, first as a tropical depression, then a Category 1 storm, and finally a Category 4 storm on May 6th. But, it weakened a bit due to wind and water movement. However, it got stronger again, becoming a Category 5 storm on May 8th. Then, it started to lose power because of strong winds from the west. By May 10th, it had turned into a tropical low and was gone by May 16th. \nTropical Cyclone Anne was a very strong storm in the South Pacific during 1988. It started as a weak storm on January 5, near Tuvalu, and got stronger as it moved southwest. On January 8, it was named Anne and quickly became very intense, affecting Vanuatu four times in four years. On January 11, it was as strong as a Category 5 hurricane, the strongest it ever was. Then, on January 12, it hit New Caledonia, a French territory. As it interacted with another storm, Agi, Anne weakened and was last seen on January 14. \nTropical Cyclone Hondo, also known as JTWC 16S, was a very strong and long-lasting storm during the 2007-08 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. It started as a tropical disturbance on February 2, far east of Diego Garcia. It quickly turned into a moderate tropical storm on February 4 and a severe one the next day. It got really strong, reaching its peak with winds of 215 km/h on February 7. Then, it slowly lost strength due to the storm moving faster and colder ocean waters.\n\nAfter a week, the storm started to form again, but it wasn't strong enough to be named again. It went around Réunion Island, got affected by it, and weakened again. Finally, on February 29, it dissipated after going in a circle. \nThe 2002-2003 cyclone season in Australia was very strong, with a storm called Cyclone Inigo that was as strong as Cyclone Gwenda in 1999. It started on November 1 and ended on April 30. The cyclone season starts and ends a little differently - from July 1, 2002 to June 30, 2003. This area, which includes parts of Australia and Papua New Guinea, had 10 cyclone tries (tropical depressions) during this time. The first one, named TC07S, started on December 27. The last cyclone, Cyclone Epi, disappeared on June 6. There were four groups watching these cyclones: one in Perth, Darwin, Brisbane from Australia, and one in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, from the Bureau of Meteorology. \nCyclone Gonu, also called Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu, was the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the Arabian Sea and the strongest one in the northern Indian Ocean in 2007. It formed on June 1 in the eastern Arabian Sea during the North Indian Ocean cyclone season. It grew very fast because the air and sea were very nice for it. On June 4, it reached its strongest winds of 235 km/h (145 mph). However, when it met dry air and cooler waters, it started to weaken. On June 6, it hit the land in Oman, which is the easternmost part of the country. After that, it moved into the Gulf of Oman and finally dissipated on June 7, after it landed in southern Iran, the first time in that region since 1898. \nTropical Cyclone Kesiny was the first storm in May 2002 to hit the south-west Indian Ocean, even though it was only a minimal hurricane. It formed in early May from a weather system near the equator, and its formation was linked to a strong weather pattern called the Madden-Julian Oscillation. This same pattern caused other storms in nearby oceans, including one in Oman and others in India.\n\nKesiny started moving southeast, but later changed direction due to a strong weather ridge. On May 6, it became a tropical cyclone, but didn't get too strong. However, on May 9, it surprisingly formed an eye and turned even stronger, reaching winds of 130 km/h. It hit Madagascar, first near Antsiranana, causing some damage. The storm weakened while crossing the country but then came back and hit again before finally disappearing on May 11. \nIn February and March 1992, a very strong tropical cyclone named Esau hit New Caledonia, which was a record-breaking storm for the area. At first, a weak tropical depression formed near Vanuatu, about 370 km away from Port Vila. It slowly developed as it moved southwest, influenced by a northerly wind. On February 25, it passed over Pentecost Island in Vanuatu and then turned towards the Malampa islands. After that, it made a circle around Espiritu Santo before being named Esau on February 26. Esau grew stronger and moved towards Australia but then made a second circle before reaching New Caledonia on March 4. When it landed, it was a Category 3 storm. But by March 5, it changed into an extratropical cyclone. The remaining parts of the storm finally went away on March 8 over New Zealand's North Island. \nIn 2011-12, the South Pacific cyclone season was very calm, with only three storms. It started on November 1 and ended on April 30. If any storms formed before June 30, they would still count. The strongest storm, Severe Tropical Cyclone Jasmine, was quite strong but not too severe. People in the area, like the RSMC in Nadi, Fiji, and the TCWC in Wellington, New Zealand, keep track of these storms. They use different ways to name and measure the storms' strength. The RSMC uses F for storms in the area and the US JTWC gives unofficial names and uses a different scale."}], "output": "\nCyclone Gonu.**"},

His work is still remembered through concepts like the Urysohn universal space. In 1923, he and Pavel Alexandrov defined the modern way of understanding compactness. \nHere's a simpler explanation: \n\nTopology is a math topic. When we have a space that isn't closed (not all points are together), the Alexandroff extension helps by adding one more point to make the whole space compact. This is called the Alexandroff extension, and it's named after a Russian mathematician named Pavel Alexandrov. \nSemyon Aranovich, born on July 23, 1934, in Derazhnya, Ukraine, was a film director who worked in both the Soviet Union and Russia.

They worked together with the United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard used big boats with 5 guns to catch the enemy and give help in battles. \nThe USS Trippe, a Knox-class frigate, was made in Louisiana and joined the Navy in September 1970. In July 1971, it had a checkup in the Caribbean and went on a watch in Haiti. After that, it went to the Boston Naval Shipyard to add a new system called the Basic Point Defense Missile System, which had short-range missiles to protect against air and missile attacks. This was a first for the Navy on a destroyer. In early 1972, it tested its new weapons and joined exercises. In June, it went to Vietnam, providing support for aircraft carriers and naval gunfire. Then, it traveled to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, visiting many ports. By December, it returned to the US, completing a round-the-world trip. \nThe discussion about how the US Navy should use naval guns to support troops is still going on. This debate involves the Navy, Marines, Congress, and a group called the US Naval Gunfire Support Association. They're talking about whether and how the Navy should use its big guns, called naval gunfire support, in modern times, especially during landings and other operations. In simple terms, it's about deciding the importance of naval guns in the Navy's work today. \nNaval gunfire support, also called shore bombardment, is when big ships use their guns to help soldiers on land, like during invasions. It's a part of something called Naval Fires. Nowadays, it's one of three ways ships help in amphibious attacks, along with planes and missiles. Ship guns have been used to attack land defenses since ships first started fighting. \nThe Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club was a playful name for the Seventh Fleet during the Vietnam War. This fleet, which was part of the US, did many actions during the war. They attacked enemies with airplane attacks from carriers, helped with navy guns, went on land with amphibious operations, watched and checked for trouble in patrolling and reconnaissance, and even used mines to protect. \nStarting in the 1890s, Italy's Royal Navy, called the Regia Marina, started building new battleships. These ships were small, had light armor, and were very fast. The first one, named after Admiral Saint Bon, was not big and had budget issues. Admiral Benedetto Brin, who took over, made the next two, called the Regina Margherita, bigger and planned to compete with other battleships. Brin couldn't finish building them because he died. Vittorio Cuniberti made the Regina Elena class, which were the fastest battleships at that time. During a war in 1911-12, they mainly supported Italian ground troops because the Ottoman Navy didn't fight much. \nKirov was a big ship, called a Kirov-class cruiser, in the Soviet Navy. It was used during different wars, like the Winter War, World War II, and Cold War. During the Winter War, it tried to hit Finnish defense guns but was scared away because it got hit a few times. Later, it helped to take people out of Tallinn in 1941, but then it couldn't leave Leningrad because it was blocked. Inside Leningrad, it could only give gun support during a very tough time called the Siege of Leningrad. In 1944, it tried again to hit Finnish places but didn't join more battles. In 1961, it was changed into a training ship, and in 1974, it was sold to be taken apart. \nJean Bart was a special kind of big boat, called a Courbet-class battleship, made for the French Navy in 1910. Before a big fight called World War I, she was built and used in the Mediterranean. In August 1914, she helped sink a ship from a different group called the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Then, in December, she was hit by a submarine and had to go to Malta to fix. Even with some parts underwater, she still went there and took three and a half months to get better. After that, she kept protecting the area in the Adriatic Sea for the rest of the war."}], "output": "\nThe captain of the only battleship to provide gunfire support during the Vietnam War was not explicitly mentioned in the passage provided.

You and the insurance company agree that if you follow the rules, they'll give your family a set amount when you pass away. Because it's guaranteed to stay active, the monthly or yearly payments (called premiums) are usually higher than for a shorter-term insurance policy called term life. The premiums don't change with age, and you can usually pay them until you die, or choose to pay them fully in specific timeframes like 10, 20, or 65.

They come from a family called Kharshbun, who are part of a group called Sarban. They live in two places: Pakistan, especially in a city called Quetta, and Afghanistan, mainly in the eastern valleys of Nangarhar and around Landi Kotal in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. \nTenskwatawa, also called Tenskatawa, was a Shawnee leader who was both religious and political. He was the younger brother of Tecumseh. When he was young, people called him Lalawethika, but later changed it. He used to drink a lot, but then became a very important spiritual figure. Tenskwatawa didn't like the Americans and thought they came from the 'Evil Spirit'. He led a group that wanted to stay close to their own traditions and beliefs, and not to be like the Americans. \nIn the early 1800s, a group of Native Americans in the Old Northwest started to join together, led by a teacher named Tenskwatawa, also known as The Prophet. This group, called Tecumseh's Confederacy, grew and had about 2,000 warriors by the end. Tecumseh, who was the brother of The Prophet and a Shawnee leader, took charge in 1808. The US saw them as a danger and fought them first in a battle in 1811 called Tippecanoe. During a time called Tecumseh's War and the War of 1812, they went to war with the US. But after Tecumseh died in 1813, the Confederacy stopped fighting. \nZiri ibn Atiyya, also called Ziri from the Berber language, was a leader who governed the Maghrawa tribal group. He was born in a family named ibn Abd Allah ibn Tabādalt ibn Muhammad ibn Khazar and lived until 1001. He was the first to lead a tribal confederacy and kingdom. \nOn November 7, 1811, there was a fight called the Battle of Tippecanoe. It happened in a place called Battle Ground in Indiana. The fight was between American leaders, including William Henry Harrison, who was in charge of Indiana, and some Native American warriors led by Tecumseh. Tecumseh and his brother, Tenskwatawa, who was known as The Prophet, were leaders of a group of Native American tribes that didn't want the United States to keep expanding into their land. Because of this disagreement, Harrison brought an army of around 1,000 people to stop them at a place called Prophetstown, near the Tippecanoe and Wabash rivers. \nProphetstown State Park, established in 2004 and located near Battle Ground, Indiana, is named after Tenskwatawa, a Native American leader. It's about a mile east of the place where the Battle of Tippecanoe happened. This park is fairly new, being Indiana's youngest state park. Inside, you can visit the Museum at Prophetstown, which has a village that shows what life was like for Native Americans and a farm from the 1920s. \nThe Battle of Fallen Timbers was a big fight that happened on August 20, 1794. It was the last one in a series of fights called the Northwest Indian War. The Native American tribes, who were friends with the British, were trying to keep control of a place called the Northwest Territory. This area was given to the United States by a special agreement called the Treaty of Paris in 1783, but the Native Americans didn't agree and kept holding on to it. The British had a base there to help them. In the end, the American army won and the British and their Native American friends left the territory. This battle stopped fighting in that area for a while, but there were more fights later in 1811. \nẒafār, also known as Dhafar, is an old place in Yemen, not far from Sana'a, the capital.

It's up high, about 2,800 meters, and there's a town nearby called Yarim, 10 kilometers away to the west. Zafar was the main city for the Himyarites, a group of tribes that ruled a big part of Arabia between 110 BCE and 525 CE.

They are a group of people who originally came from Nigeria as freed slaves or settlers in the 19th century, mainly from Yoruba descent. They are mostly Muslim and have a conservative Muslim community. The British government recognized them as a separate community, and although the Sierra Leone government considers them part of the Creole group, many people see them as a distinct ethnic group. \nThe Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH) is a Catholic group for people from Ireland or with Irish roots. They are mainly in the US, where they started in 1836 in New York. They were created to protect Catholic churches from people not liking Catholics and to help Irish immigrants, especially those who worked hard and faced problems. Some members were part of a group called the Molly Maguires, and they became a big part of Irish American politics. \nThe Pinpu tribe, also known as Pepo or Plains tribes, lived in the western plains of Taiwan and mainly farmed. Before the arrival of many Han Chinese in the 17th century, they didn't have to fight against outsiders like the Dutch, Spanish, and Han Chinese who tried to influence them. Unfortunately, by the end of the 19th century, most tribes had almost completely become like the Han Chinese, losing their own languages and culture. They are now a small part of a mostly Han Chinese society. During Japanese rule, experts studied them and created a classification based on their research. \nExplanation: African Bermudians, or those with African ancestry, are people from Bermuda who have roots in Africa. They were brought to the island as slaves and there were also Free Blacks who moved there to work as servants. By the 1800s, the number of Black people became larger than the White ones, making them the biggest ethnic group in Bermuda. In the 20th century, this group was officially recognized as an ethnic identity. \nIn Philadelphia and the nearby areas, a big part of the population comes from Irish roots. They've been living there since way before America was founded. During the American Revolution, some Irish people even helped in the fight for freedom. In the 1800s, when lots of people from Europe came to the US, including a big number of Irish from rural areas due to the famine, Philadelphia changed a lot. The city used to be mostly Quakers, but now it's very diverse because of different religions like Catholicism and Protestantism. Because the city needed workers for factories, the Irish started working in these industries. However, there were some problems with anti-Irish feelings in the 1840s and 1850s, which led to riots. But later, the Irish became successful and started their own schools and businesses. \nThe Americo-Liberians, also known as Congo people in Liberian English, are a group of people in Liberia who have African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and African heritage. They are related to the Sierra Leone Creole people, another ethnic group with similar background and culture. \n\nIn the 19th century, free African Americans and former slaves, known as Americo-Liberians, moved to Liberia to create the country. They identified themselves as such. Some of these African Americans also settled in Canada and later in Sierra Leone and Côte d'Ivoire, contributing to those places as well.\n\nAlthough there were differences in the definitions of Americo-Liberian and Congo in the past, today these terms are used interchangeably to describe an ethnic group made up of descendants of those who came to Liberia from Africa in 1822, including free African Americans, Caribbean people, Recaptured slaves, and Sierra Leone Creoles. \nIn Boston, Massachusetts, a big group of people with Irish roots is the biggest ethnic group. A long time ago, Boston was mostly for Puritans, but in the 1800s, things changed when people from Europe started coming. A lot of Irish people came during a really hard time in Ireland called the Great Famine. They became very important in Boston and made it a more diverse city. Even though they worked and lived together, they didn't usually mix with the original English people. There was some dislike towards the Irish in the 1800s because of their religion, but when they fought for the Union during the Civil War, people started to like them more. \nCzechs who live in Ukraine, called Volhynian Czechs, are mainly from or related to Czech people. They moved to Ukraine, especially the Volhynia area, in the late 1800s. Around 16,000 Czechs left their home in Austria-Hungary for Russia between 1868 and 1880. They came because life in their own country was tough and there were promises of a better life with more farmland in Russia. The local leaders in Ukraine helped by offering them to buy land cheaply, starting businesses, and allowing them to learn, govern themselves, and practice their religion. They were also given tax breaks and no military service for 20 years. Most settled in places like Volhynia, Lutsk, and Zhytomyr. They worked in different fields like agriculture, factories, trade, and crafts. They built schools, churches, and libraries, which made their community rich in culture and activities.

The judges choose the winner without being asked. \nWilliam Walton wrote a Viola Concerto in 1929 for a violist named Lionel Tertis. Sir Thomas Beecham suggested it. The piece is dedicated to Christabel, but Tertis didn't want it. Paul Hindemith, a violist, performed it first and people liked it a lot. It made Walton famous in British classical music. A reviewer said it was a genius piece. Tertis later changed his mind and decided to perform it too. \nThe Most Incredible Thing is a fairy tale written by Hans Christian Andersen, a Danish poet, in 1870. It's about a competition where people try to find the most amazing thing and what happens when someone wins. The story was first shown to English readers in the US in 1870 and then in Danish in Denmark later that year. This was the first of Andersen's stories to be published in Denmark during World War II, and he thought it was one of his best. \nA novel called A Thing of Beauty by A. J. Cronin, first published in 1956, has another name, Crusader's Tomb. It's about a man named Stephen Desmonde, an artist from England who really loves painting but has a hard time being recognized.

These fish are unique because they live in or near caves and have special features for cave life, like no scales, no color, and small eyes (some can't see). Some have a curved back and some even have a horn on their head, which we don't fully understand. Fish that live above ground or in non-cave areas don't have these cavefish traits.\n\nThey are usually not very big, up to 23 cm long. Each species has a small habitat range, which makes them endangered. Many species in this genus need more study to understand their populations. \nMyiodynastes is a bird group in the Tyrannidae family. In 1857, a scientist named Charles Lucien Bonaparte made this group. There are 5 bird types in it, called sulphur-bellied flycatchers. This name also applies to one bird in the group. The name Myiodynastes comes from two Greek words: muia for fly and dunastẽs for ruler. \nLeptospermum is a type of small trees and shrubs in the Myrtle family, called tea trees. Sometimes, Melaleuca is also called this. Most of them live only in Australia, especially in the southern part, but a few can be found in New Zealand and Southeast Asia. These plants have five petals and five groups of stamens, and their flowers have one central style. The fruit they produce is a hard, wooden capsule. The first time people wrote about them was in 1776 by two German botanists. But it wasn't until 1979 that they clearly defined the different species within the genus. Leptospermums can grow in many types of environments, but they often prefer wet, soil with little nutrients. They are popular for gardening, making honey, and in flower arrangements. \nAraripesuchus was a type of ancient crocodile-like animal that lived during the Cretaceous Period in places like Western Africa and South America. There are at least five different species in this group. People are still trying to figure out how they are related, especially with Araripesuchus wegeneri. This species was small, walked upright, and had special teeth that show it might have eaten both plants and animals. Its limbs were delicate, suggesting it was a land animal, unlike today's crocodiles and alligators. \nThe Marsileaceae is a small group of ferns that live in water or near it. They don't look like other ferns at first, but they are called pepperwort or water-clover family because their leaves look like four-leaf clovers. People sometimes use the leaves on Saint Patrick's Day instead of clover. There are three genera and around 50 to 80 species in this family, and most of them belong to the Marsilea genus. \nThe Be'er Sheva fringe-fingered lizard, a type of lizard in the Beersheva family (Lacertidae), belongs to the Lacertinae subgenus and Acanthodactylus tribe. It's a distinct species recognized by its unique features and is found in isolated areas. Even though it shares some genes with Acanthodactylus pardalis, its differences in appearance separate it. These lizards, like others in the Acanthodactylus genus, lay between 3 and 7 eggs at a time. They can grow up to 17 to 20 centimeters, but some can be even bigger. This species is unique to the Negev desert in Israel and the Palestinian Territories, which is a region with a lot of biodiversity. \nA fen is a type of wetland, like grassy marshes, forested swamps, and bogs. It's part of a bigger group called mires. Fens have special soil that's made of peat and is rich in minerals, not much other plant food. They are neutral or slightly alkaline and have lots of minerals in the water, but not much else. They are mostly made up of grasses and sedges, and have brown mosses like Scorpidium or Drepanocladus. Fens can be found near big lakes and rivers, where the water level changes a lot. The plants that live there are very connected to the water and how much mineral it has. \nMarsilea minuta, a small water fern, is like a tiny plant that lives in water. It's part of a group called Marsileaceae. Sometimes, people mix it up with Marsilea vestita, but they are not the same. People also call it gelid waterklawer, little water clover, airy pepperwort, or pepperwort, but remember, pepperwort can also mean other plants. In French, it's called Marsilea minuta."}], "output": "\nThe Marsilea genus has more individual species of plants.**"},

It holds special importance as both a traditional meeting place for Kaurna people and a place where early European settlers first settled. The area is also known by other names like Fairford, Laffer's Triangle, and Sturt Triangle. It is surrounded by roads like Marion Road, Sturt Road, and South Road, and the Sturt River flows through it, going west across the Adelaide Plains from Sturt Gorge. \nIn the Canadian government, the person called the President of The Queen's Privy Council for Canada is in charge of the office that handles Privy Council matters. This position is mostly for showing respect and not for making important decisions. They only meet for special events, like when the new queen or prince gets married. The last time this person had to主持 a Privy Council meeting was in 1981 for Prince Charles' engagement. It's kind of like the role of the Lord President of the Council in the United Kingdom. \nThe Great Hall of the People is a big building in Beijing, near Tiananmen Square. It's where the government and the Communist Party of China work. They have meetings there for important events, like when the people's representatives come together to make laws (National People's Congress) and when the leaders of the party gather (National Congress of the Communist Party). These meetings happen every year in March and every five years, respectively. \nExplanation: The Accession Council in the UK is a group that gets together when a king or queen passes away (Crown passes). They meet at a place called St James's Palace and officially announce the new person who will be the king or queen (Succession). According to a law called the Act of Settlement from 1701, the new person becomes the ruler right away. This proclamation also makes sure we know who the new heir is. \nThe Grange Hall in Somerset, a town in Jackson County, Illinois, is where the local Grange group, Somerset Township's chapter, meets. It was made in 1912, and it's the second Grange hall because the first one, from 1876, burned down in 1909. The red-brick building, designed in the Commercial style, was built by a person named W. A. Pitman. The Grange Hall was a place for farmers to talk about farming, suggest rules for the government, and even published a newspaper called the Union Farmer from there until 1914. It was also a place for community events, elections, and social gatherings. In 1988, the hall was fixed up, and it still works as a polling place for the township today. \nCrowther Masonic Hall, also known as Freemasons' Hall, in Kollam, India, was a main meeting place for Freemasonry lodges in the Quilon area. It has been functioning since 1806 and is close to Kochupilamoodu in the city. This place holds significance as a historic monument for Freemasonry activities in the old Travancore region. \nThe Pollokshields Burgh Hall is a building in Glasgow, Scotland, near Maxwell Park. It was made in the 1700s in a special Scottish style called Baronial. It was opened in 1890 by a man named Sir John Stirling Maxwell for Masons to meet and for the community to use. However, the area it served became part of the city very soon after, in 1891. Inside, there were places for meetings and a small court. Even now, the hall is still used for Masonic meetings, which explains the symbols you see, like in the carvings and the stained-glass windows. \nThe Blackman-Bosworth Store, also called Bosworth Store Building, is a special old store in Beverly, West Virginia. It's over 100 years old and used to sell things at a low price. It was built in 1828 and got a little bigger in 1894. The main part of the store is a two-story brick building with a stone base. Before it was a store, it was used as a courthouse, post office, and for meetings for a short time. In 1973, a group called the Randolph County Historical Society bought it and now it's a museum where people can learn about the area's history, and they also meet there."}], "output": "\nSt James's Palace.**"},

It has the third-most buildings in the world, after New York City and Hong Kong, with 6,467 buildings. There are 193 buildings over 100 meters tall, mostly in the downtown along a main road and a neighborhood called Brooklin. In the past, the city had the tallest building in Latin America, the Martinelli Building, which was 130 meters tall. The tallest building now is the Mirante do Vale, standing 170 meters, from 1960.\n\nHowever, the city has many smaller buildings, usually up to 80 meters, and not many skyscrapers due to rules that limit their construction. The financial district, where many skyscrapers are, has moved. Even though São Paulo has 10 buildings over 90 meters, it's ranked 10th in the world for these tall buildings, after some cities like Hong Kong, New York, Tokyo, and so on. \nOne Raffles Link is a big office building in Marina Centre, Singapore. It has 6 floors, a ground floor, and is run by a company called Hongkong Land. It was finished in 2000 and was made by famous architects Kohn Pedersen Fox and Aedas LPT Architects. It cost a lot of money to build, $340 million, and is a very good place for big companies like VISA, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs, and Citibank to work. The building is special because it has big open spaces, and there's a mall underground called CityLink Mall that connects it to a train station and other big buildings nearby. \nCapitaGreen, or Market Street Tower, is an office building in Raffles Place, Singapore. It was made by a designer named Toyo Ito and finished in 2014. This tall building, reaching 242 meters, is one of the highest in the city. \nChevron House, previously known as Caltex House, is a tall building in the middle of Singapore's business area. It's at 30 Raffles Place, right next to Raffles Place, where many important buildings and places are close by, like the Singapore Land Tower and Hitachi Tower, Change Alley, and The Arcade, all less than 100 meters away. You can easily go to the building by taking the Raffles Place MRT Station, which is underground. The building is connected to Hitachi Tower, which shares a floor for shopping. \nRaffles Place MRT Station is a big underground station in Singapore that connects two train lines, North South Line and East West Line, in the heart of the city, called Downtown Core. It's very close to the important area for money stuff, Raffles Place. It's super busy because it's a place where many trains and buses meet. The station has many doors to go in and out, and one of them looks like a small copy of an old building called John Little building. \n Republic Plaza is a very tall building in Singapore, right in the middle of the city's business area, called Downtown Core. It's one of three tallest buildings, along with OUB Centre and UOB Plaza One. It's 280 meters (like 919 feet) high and was finished in 1995. Even though the city doesn't usually have earthquakes, the building was made to be strong and safe against them. \nThe building at 1 Marina Boulevard, also known as NTUC Centre, is a 32-story tall skyscraper in the heart of Singapore's central business district, near Raffles Place and Marina Bay.

It was very common in Hollywood during the 1930s, but the Supreme Court stopped it in 1948. Independent theaters had to agree to show a lot of the studio's movies without seeing them first. This let the studios sell both good and not-so-good movies together, making things cheaper for them. When a theater buys a movie without seeing it, that's called blind bidding. \nRichard Baker vs. Gerald Nelson is a court case from Minnesota in 1971. The state court said a law that only allowed marriage between people of different genders did not go against the US Constitution. Baker tried to argue, but in 1972, the top US court said there wasn't a big enough federal issue to consider and dismissed his case. This meant the court really decided the case, making it a precedent. In 2013, Minnesota made same-sex marriage legal, but in 2015, the US Supreme Court said in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex marriage should be legal everywhere. \nThe Van der Peet case, decided in 1996 by the Supreme Court of Canada (2 S.C.R. 507), is a significant one about how the Constitution Act of 1982 protects Aboriginal rights. The court said that Aboriginal people's right to fish doesn't allow them to sell fish for profit. Because of this, they created a test called the Van der Peet test to figure out if there is an Aboriginal right. This test is part of a series of cases known as the Van der Peet trilogy, which also includes R v NTC Smokehouse Ltd and R v Gladstone. \nThe case, United States v. Binion, 132 F. App'x 89 (2005), is about a court in the Eighth Circuit in the United States. They looked at a person's punishment because the trial court used some recent rules from the Supreme Court. These rules are from decisions called United States v. Booker and United States v. Fanfan. The court agreed with the Federal District Court's decision about the punishment. \nIn 1999, there was a court case called Lau Kong Yung vs. the Director of Immigration in Hong Kong. It was connected to a previous important case, Ng Ka Ling vs. the same person, in 1999. Before Lau's case, the Chinese government's Standing Committee made a change to the Basic Law, which affects how people like Lau could live in Hong Kong. Because of this change, the court in Lau was the first to consider an NPCSC interpretation when applying the Basic Law. \nIn 2006, the Ohio Supreme Court looked at a case called Norwood, Ohio v. Horney. This case came after another big case, Kelo v. City of New London, where the top court in the US said it's okay for cities to take land for building things through something called eminent domain. In Norwood, the court was focusing on how Ohio's own state constitution limited this power. So, the main point was about Ohio rules versus US rules. \nDuring Morrison Waite's time as Chief Justice from 1874 to 1888, the Supreme Court saw a huge number of criminal cases, almost as many as in the whole history of the court before him. In just 14 years, they heard 106 cases. Some famous cases from this period include: Cruikshank vs. United States (1875), Reese vs. United States (1875), Reynolds vs. United States (1878), and many others. These cases were significant in the legal landscape of the time. \nThe Marshall Court, which operated from 1801 to 1835, heard about 41 criminal cases. This means they dealt with one case差不多 every year. Some important cases they handled are: Simms v. United States in 1803, More v. United States in 1805, Bollman v. Ex parte in 1807, Hudson v.

The building has been repainted twice, once in the 1920s and again in the 1960s. People who found it out knew it had a big history, but not many people outside Bali knew about it. Inside, there's a story about a character named Bhima Swarga, which comes from a big Hindu story called the Mahabharata. But the story at the Kertha Gosa Pavilion is just a small part of the whole story. \nThe Oleson Park Music Pavilion, or Karl King Bandshell, is a place in Fort Dodge, Iowa, where music concerts happen. It was made for bands, named after Karl King, a famous band composer. The person who designed it, Henry L. Kamphoefner, also made a bandstand in Sioux City before. It was built because of a program called Works Progress Administration (WPA) that helped pay for 85% of the construction. The city of Fort Dodge paid the rest. The building looks modern with some Deco style and is 36 feet tall. It's good at making music sound great. Before this, there was a bandstand in the city square from the 1920s. In 1976, they dedicated it to Karl King, and in 2003, it became part of a special list of important places called the National Register of Historic Places. \nThe Concord Pavilion, previously called Sleep Train Pavilion and Chronicle Pavilion, is a big open space for shows in Concord, California. It's owned by the city and run by a company called Live Nation. It can hold 12,500 people and has been around since 1975.

It's named after 'hoeck' in Dutch, which means a point of land. The area where it's located is near streets like Montgomery, Hudson, Dudley, and Van Vorst. The main road is Washington Street, going both ways. The neighborhood has a park with a part of Liberty State Park and a view of the Morris Canal. There's a train called the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail that stops at Essex Street and a water taxi at Warren Street. These transportation changes have brought more shops, restaurants, and outdoor seating to the area. \nA sala, also called a sala Thai, is a type of open pavilion used for meetings and to keep people dry from sun and rain. It can be found in many temples, especially in Buddhist areas called wats, but can also be in other places. Building a sala in a temple or public area is seen as a good deed, and those in temples are called salawat. Some big salas in temples are for people to listen to teachings or learn. There are also sala kan parian, which are big salas where monks prepare for important religious exams. City halls or places where provincial governors work are called sala wa kan or sala klang changwat, meaning government pavilion or provincial main pavilion. \nCorus Quay, previously known as First Waterfront Place, is a tall building with eight floors that works as a office for businesses. It's located by the water in Toronto, Canada, on a big land by the lake. It cost $160 million to build and was the first big project in a place called East Bayfront. It was finished near a street called Jarvis Street. Corus Entertainment, a company that makes TV shows and movies, moved all its offices from ten different places to this new building. The construction was done by a group from the city called Toronto Economic Development Corporation (TEDCO). They got some money from themselves, the city, and another group called Waterfront Toronto who gave $12.5 million. \nThe Grandview Park Music Pavilion is a special building in Sioux City, Iowa, that was built a long time ago. In 1930, a group called the Monahan Post Band wanted to build a small music place in the park. But when they started, the people living nearby didn't like the design, so they stopped. Then, in 1933, when President Roosevelt made a program to help fix things, the city asked for help to build a new music pavilion. A man named Henry Kamphoefner, who wasn't famous at that time, made the plans. There were pretty decorations on the front made by Herschel Elarth. The project started in 1934 and took a lot of materials, like steel and cement, to finish. It could hold 5,000 people and cost $47,436 from money given by the government and $3,800 from the city. It was finished in October 1934 and dedicated in 1935. The Monahan Post Band played there until 1948 when they became the Sioux City Municipal Band.

In those days, ties were not allowed, so if a match ended with the same score, they used a special part called a shootout to decide who wins. The numbers you see in the paragraph don't include goals from shootouts because that's not how they counted points. If a team won a shootout, they got 2 points, but if they lost, they got 0. So, even though the regular season had 49 points shown, it doesn't include the points from shootouts. \nIn the 1999 season, the Kansas City Wizards played their games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. In that year, MLS didn't allow games to end in a tie, so they used a shootout to decide if there was a draw. The numbers you see in the statistics don't include goals from shootouts. The total points for the regular season, even though it shows 24, were actually calculated based on points from wins and losses in the shootout (2 points for a win, 0 for a loss). The team's first coach, Ron Newman, was replaced by Bob Gansler during the season. \nThe 2004 MLS Cup, the 9th one, was a soccer game to find the best team for that year. It was between D.C. United and the Kansas City Wizards. They played on November 14, 2004, at a place called The Home Depot Center in California. D.C. United won the game 3-2, with a goal that happened because a Wizard player, Alex Zotinca, accidentally scored for D.C. United. This win was D.C. United's fourth time winning the MLS Cup and their first time since 1999. \nHere's a simplified version of the paragraph: \n\nThis is a list of players who have played at least one game for Sporting Kansas City, starting from when the team joined Major League Soccer in 1996. Players who were on the team but never played in a real game are not included. If a player played in other matches like the US Open Cup or CONCACAF Champions League but never in the MLS, their info is at the end of the list. \nIn 2008, the Wizards' games were held at a temporary field called Community America Ballpark in Kansas City, Kansas, which was their first season there. \nCurt Johnson is the leader of two soccer teams, NCFC in the NASL and NC Courage in the NWSL. He has also worked as a boss in charge of organizing things for the Richmond Kickers, a team in the A-League, and the Kansas City Wizards, now known as Sporting Kansas City, which are in Major League Soccer. \nIn 1998, the Kansas City Wizards were part of the third season of the MLS. They played their games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. During that time, the league didn't let games end in ties, so they used a special way called Shootouts to decide if a match was a draw. But, the scores you see here don't include goals from Shootouts because they don't count towards the regular season points. If a team won a shootout, they got 1 point, and if they lost, they got 0 points. So, even though the total points shown are 36, it doesn't fully represent the actual points from the regular season."}], "output": "\nThe first home venue of the Kansas City Wizards, later known as Sporting Kansas City, was Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.**"},

He was known for leading the British colony of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic when Napoleon Bonaparte, the former emperor, was imprisoned there. Plampin started his naval career at 13 and served during the American Revolutionary War, mainly in the Caribbean. In the French Revolutionary Wars, he had mixed experiences, including a shipwreck and serving ashore during sieges. After the Peace of Amiens, he commanded the ship HMS Powerful and had successful missions in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean. When Napoleon was captured, Plampin was put in charge of the fleet at the Cape of Good Hope, which also looked after Saint Helena, where he often visited and talked to Napoleon. \nThe Historic Camden Revolutionary War Site is a special place in Camden, South Carolina, near a city called Columbia, which is about 40 minutes away. It's like a big outdoor museum and is very important because it shows how people fought in a war a long time ago during the American Revolution. The site is 107 acres big and has old buildings and grounds that still look like they did back then. It's taken care of by a group of people who give money and local governments, and it's even connected to the National Park Service for help. \nBlanket bog, also called featherbed bog, is a type of land where water stays a lot and doesn't evaporate much, which helps peat (a type of soil) to grow not only in low areas but also on raised land. The name comes from the peat covering the ground, sometimes thick and sometimes thin. You can find these bogs in many places, especially in Ireland, Britain, Russia, and parts of North America. \nCarnival Cravings, with Anthony Anderson, is a Food Network show in America. It shows special food you can only find at carnivals, fairs, and festivals. Anthony, the host, tries these unique dishes. The show started on August 12, 2015 and you can watch it on Wednesdays at 10:00 p.m. EDT. \nKarachi cuisine is the type of food found in Karachi, a city in Pakistan. It's affected by the Muhajir people, who are Urdu-speaking Muslims from India and moved to Karachi after Pakistan became independent in 1947. These Muhajirs mainly live in Karachi and their food has a unique Muhajir flavor. They still have many dishes and drinks from their old culture. \nJohn Adlum, born on April 29, 1759 and passed away on March 14, 1836, was a significant figure in American viticulture. He is called the father of American viticulture because he was the first to grow the Catawba grape. He had other important roles too: he fought in the American Revolutionary War, worked as a skilled surveyor, and was one of the first judges in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania. Additionally, he served in the US Army during the War of 1812. \nThis paragraph is about fossils that show the remains of food the animals ate before they died. These are called consumulites and are a special kind of fossil, bromalite. They can show food in the animal's mouth, throat, stomach, or intestines. Fossils like feces (coprolites) and vomit (regurgitalites) are also part of this group because they show what the animal threw up or passed out. The fossils are divided into four groups based on where the food was when the animal died: oralites (in the mouth), esophagolites (in the throat), gastrolites (partly digested stomach), and cololites (from the intestines). \nBoortsog is a type of crispy, fried dough food that comes from places like Central Asia, Idel-Ural, Mongolia, and the Middle East. It can be made in the shape of triangles or round balls. The dough is made with flour, yeast, milk, eggs, butter, salt, sugar, and sometimes some fat. In Tajik cuisine, they put a pretty pattern on it by pressing a small strainer on the dough before frying. Other names for it include boorsoq, bauyrsaq, baursak, and boorcsog."}], "output": "\nCarnival Cravings, with Anthony Anderson, is not related to the cultivation of a food found in bogs.

When she was in New York as a deputy consul, she got into big trouble because she told lies on a paper for her maid's visa. She said she would pay the maid a fair wage, but she didn't. When she got into trouble for this, she had to go to a judge and they searched her body. This made both India and the US mad and caused a big problem between the two countries. In 2016, she even wrote a book called The White Sari. \nA&W Restaurants is a popular fast-food place known for its special root beer and root beer floats. It started in 1919 when Roy W. Allen started a small root beer stand in California. A friend of his, Frank Wright, joined him and together they opened the first A&W restaurant in Sacramento in 1923. The name comes from their last names, Allen and Wright. People love their cold mugs - they keep the mugs in the freezer and fill them with their famous root beer before giving them to customers. \nRinger Hut is a Japanese fast-food chain that serves special dishes from Nagasaki, like Champon and Sara udon.

They have over 550 restaurants in Japan, Taiwan, and San Jose, and also have 100 other restaurants called Hamakatsu that serve tonkatsu. The company has two main offices in Fukuoka and Tokyo. \nPolice perjury, also known as testifying falsely in police slang, is when a police officer gives incorrect information in a court. This usually happens in criminal trials to make the case against someone the police think is guilty. If there were problems during the person's arrest or search, it might lead to the defendant being found not guilty. Perjury can also mean making up facts to charge someone the police believe is guilty, or even lying to frame someone who is actually innocent. In simple terms, it's when a police officer lies when they are under oath to help win a case. \nJacob D. Robida was a teenager from Massachusetts who, in 2006, attacked people at a gay bar in New Bedford. He ran away and went to Charleston, West Virginia, where he took a woman named Jennifer Dunlap hostage.

He was caught and tried to escape but hit a spike strip and stopped. In Norfork, he lost control of his car, hit two parked cars, and killed his hostage by shooting her. The police then shot him. \nIn Japan, there's a thing called part-time job terrorism (バイトテロ). People who work part-time, like at fast-food places, sometimes do silly acts like hanging upside down on countertops (called planking) to get attention from their friends. They do this by taking photos or videos and sharing them on social media. These people often feel unhappy with their jobs, because they don't get much money and have to work long hours. In Japan, doing such pranks is seen as disrespectful, but it's not as common in other cultures. \nCoronado is a place near Panama City that's great for vacations. It's about an hour away and lots of people from all over come here every year to relax. This place was the first resort in Panama, so it has a bit of an advantage over other beach towns. You can find lots of things here, like big grocery stores, drug stores, places to eat (from cheap to fancy), hospitals, places to buy plants and tools, banks, clothes shops, markets, and even a shopping center and a new mall. \nA body cavity search is when police or healthcare workers look inside body parts, like pockets or holes, to find things that are not allowed, like drugs or weapons. This is more detailed than just feeling someone's skin for these items. It usually happens when someone is arrested or in a place where they're being kept, like a jail, and they might have to do it again when they leave. \n\nExplanation:\n- Simplified the terms body cavity search and cavity search\n- Specified what is searched for: prohibited materials like drugs or weapons\n- Mentioned the body parts used for concealment\n- Explained that it's more invasive than a simple strip search\n- Added context about when the procedure might happen (arrest or in a place) and if it's repeated."}], "output": "\nThe movie title for the scam involving a male calling small town fast-food restaurants and pretending to be a police officer is \"The White Sari.\"**"},

He also played in various minor league teams from 1906 to 1916, mostly as an outfielder but later as a pitcher. His minor league career had a batting average of .251 with 670 hits in 694 games. As a pitcher, he had a win-loss record of 90-63. Fox was right-handed in both batting and throwing. \nRon Herbel, a baseball player who threw with his right hand, played in the Major Leagues. He only hit .029 in his games, which is the lowest batting average ever recorded for someone who had at least 100 tries. This means he didn't get many hits during his career. \nHoward Dick Kauffman, born on June 22, 1888 and passed away in 1948, was a baseball player who played for 11 years. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for two seasons with the St. Louis Browns in 1914 and 1915. Kauffman was a first baseman and had a career batting average of .259 in the MLB, scoring 10 runs, hitting 36 times, with nine doubles, two triples, and 16 RBIs in 44 games.\n\nHe started his professional baseball journey in 1911 with the York White Roses in a minor league. His first MLB season was in 1914, and he was called back again in 1915. After that, he only played in minor leagues. In those years, he had a minor league batting average of .279, with 1,239 hits in 1,217 games.\n\nKauffman played for various minor league teams like the York White Roses, Elmira Colonels, Atlanta Crackers, and Nashville Volunteers. Before becoming a professional, he attended Bucknell University and Susquehanna University.\n\nIn simple terms, Howard Kauffman was a baseball player who played for the St. Louis Browns in the majors for two years and had a career in minor leagues where he hit .279 with 1,239 hits. He attended college before starting his baseball career. \n Francis Patrick Frank Crossin, Sr., a baseball player, played for seven years, three in the Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Browns from 1912 to 1914. He was a catcher with a batting average of .147 in 55 games, scoring 8 runs, hitting 17 times, having one double and one triple, and 7 RBIs. He started in the minor league with Binghamton Bingoes in 1912 and made his MLB debut on September 24, 1912. In 1915, after his MLB career, he went back to the minors. In those minors, he had a .261 batting average with 303 hits in 381 games. He was 5 feet tall and weighed 160 pounds, and he batted and threw right-handed. \nGerman Barranca Costales, born on October 19, 1956 in Mexico, was a baseball player who used to play as a second baseman. He started his career in the Major League Baseball (MLB) on September 2, 1979, when he was 22, playing for the Kansas City Royals against the New York Yankees. In 1979 and 1980, he played 5 and 7 games, respectively, with a batting average of .600.\n\nOn January 21, 1981, he was traded from the Royals to the Cincinnati Reds for Cesar Geronimo. In 1981 and 1982, he played for the Reds, with batting averages of .333 and .255, respectively. His last game in the MLB was on July 11, 1982, at the age of 25. He had a .250 batting average and was leading the National League in triples before the All-Star break.\n\nDue to his performance, he was sent to the Indianapolis Triple-A affiliate of the Reds. On September 7, 1982, he was traded again, this time to the Detroit Tigers as part of a deal. In total, German played 67 games in the MLB, with 62 at-bats, 19 runs, 18 hits, 2 doubles, 3 triples, 5 stolen bases, and a fielding percentage of .893. His career average was .290. \nThe Tigers, a baseball team from Detroit in 1921, did not do very well. They finished sixth in their league, 27 games behind the Yankees, and had a record of 71 wins and 82 losses. Even though they didn't win a lot, they hit the ball very well, with 1,724 hits and the highest team batting average in American League history at .316. Their three outfielders, Harry Heilmann, Ty Cobb, and Bobby Veach, were all excellent with high batting averages and RBIs.\n\nHowever, the team's weakness was their pitching. They had a high ERA of 4.40, and only one pitcher, Dutch Leonard, had a good ERA below 4.24. This shows that sometimes, even when you hit a lot, if you can't stop the other team from scoring, it can affect the outcome. \nCharles Chick Shorten was a baseball player who played in the Major League Baseball for 8 years from 1911 to 1928. He played as an outfielder for the Boston Red Sox, Detroit Tigers, St. Louis Browns, and Cincinnati Reds. In 1916, he was part of the Red Sox team that won the World Series. During that year, he had a great performance with a batting average of .571. In his whole career, he played in 527 games and had an average of .275. \nBatting average in baseball is a way to see how well a batter does when they try to hit the ball. In Major League Baseball (MLB), you find out a player's batting average by dividing the number of hits they get by the number of times they try (at bats). If a player in the American League (AL) has the best average, they win the Rod Carew American League Batting Championship, and in the National League (NL), it's the Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion. To be considered for the batting title, a player needs to play in at least 162 games and have about 3.1 tries per game. But if a player's average is way above everyone else and they still meet this, they still win. In 1996, Tony Gwynn had a high average of .353, but he only had 451 at bats. If he had four more tries without hitting, his average would be .349, but that was still the highest among the players who qualified, so he still won the title."}], "output": "\nThe arcade game named after the player with a 0.300 batting average for 7 consecutive seasons is not mentioned in the passage provided.

It's about a family living together in the middle class. The story for the film comes from a Bengali writer named Pracheta Gupta. Majumdar included some songs by Rabindra Sangeet, which are famous Bengali songs, in the movie.\n\nRevised paragraph: \n\nChander Bari is a 2007 Bengali film directed by Tarun Majumdar. It's about a regular family from a middle-class background. The story is from a writer named Pracheta Gupta. The movie has some songs by Rabindra Sangeet, a famous singer from Bengal. \nThe sousaphone is a special kind of brass instrument, like a tuba, that was made to be easier for musicians to play when they're standing or marching. It was created in 1893 by a company for a band leader named John Philip Sousa. It's different from a tuba because it's bent in a circle around the musician and has a big, flaring bell that sends the sound forward. This instrument is great for marching bands and other music because it's easy to carry and the sound goes far. At first, sousaphones were made of strong brass, but later, they became lighter with materials like fiberglass. Both types are still used today. \nA bukkehorn, also known as a bockhorn in Swedish, is a musical instrument from ancient Norway and Sweden. It's made from a goat horn that's been collected 5-7 years before making the instrument. Shepherds and milkmaids used it on mountain farms during summer to communicate or scare away animals. When the horn had holes for fingers, they could play simple tunes. There are two ways to blow it: mostly using the trumpet sound and sometimes the clarinet sound too. \nAn experimental musical instrument is a special kind of tool that makes existing instruments different or makes new ones. It can be made by changing something simple, like adding a small part to a drum or using a funny thing from home, like a bathtub plug, to quiet a brass instrument. Or, it can be made using electronic parts or combining acoustic and electronic parts to create something new. \nUdaka Vadya is a musical instrument from India. Some people think it's similar to Jal Tarang. It's a type of percussion that makes noise by hitting a surface, and it was talked about in old music books from the medieval times. It's even mentioned in a book called Vatsyayana's Kamasutra and in a book from the 1700s called Sangeeta Parijata. Learning how to play this instrument was very important for women, as it was one of 64 special skills they needed to learn. \nThe keyboard glockenspiel, also known as the organ glockenspiel, is a musical instrument that uses a piano keyboard to play. It first appeared in Handel's opera Saul in 1739. It was also used in other Handel's works like Il Trionfo del Tempo and Acis and Galatea in 1739, and in L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato the following year. Mozart used a similar instrument in The Magic Flute in 1791, which is now sometimes played by a celesta instead. Maurice Ravel liked the keyboard glockenspiel because it can produce a loud sound, called ff, for big moments in music. In the late 20th century, Bergerault created a three-octave instrument with a pedal to control damping, suitable for the wide range of sounds in modern music. \nAn asset class is a collection of things that are similar in how they work and how they act in the market. We can divide them into two groups: real assets and financial assets. These assets usually follow the same rules, but not always. For example, futures, which are contracts to buy something later, are part of the same group as the thing they're based on, but they have different rules than the original asset. \nAccompaniment is the music that helps support the main parts of a song or instrument. It can be different in different types of music. In homophonic music, which is common in pop, the main voice is sung with simple chords. In pop and traditional music, the accompaniment keeps the beat and shows how the song's chords change. It can be done by one person playing an instrument like piano, organ, or guitar. Any instrument can be used, but keyboard and guitar are often picked because they can play chords and bass at the same time. A singer can play and sing along, like using a guitar or piano, or even use their voice and body in some cases."}], "output": "\nUdaka Vadya.**"},

He believes that reality is not like a list of separate things, but more like a continuous flow, like what some philosophers talk about. Reality can't be fully understood by just looking at parts separately. Bergson says we should try to feel or understand the whole, not just observe it from the outside. This means we should try to connect with the object, not just observe it. \nDuration is a idea about time and how we experience it, created by a French thinker named Henri Bergson. He thought that the way time is understood by scientists and math, like Herbert Spencer, wasn't right because they couldn't understand how it feels or how it changes for each person. Bergson believed that time is not like a straight line we can measure, but more like a continuous flow that can speed up or slow down. Instead of trying to measure each moment, we understand it through our personal experiences and feelings.\n\nBergson decided to focus on the inner world of humans, which is a type of duration that is not just one thing but also not many things at once. It's hard to explain directly because it's a deep, personal feeling that can't be fully described. We can understand it better by thinking creatively and imagining it, not by using exact numbers or pictures. \nSamuel Eliot Morison was a famous American historian known for his books about maritime history and American history. He got a special degree from Harvard in 1912 and taught there for 40 years. He won big prizes for his books about Columbus and John Paul Jones. In 1942, he wrote a very big history of the US Navy during World War II, which took 15 years to finish. He also wrote a popular book about American history and helped write a book about the country's growth. Morison got many special honors, like honorary degrees and awards, for his work. \nOn April 18, 2011, the Pulitzer Prizes for 2011 were announced. The Los Angeles Times and the New York Times both won two awards. There was no prize for the Breaking News category. The Wall Street Journal, which hadn't won since 2007, won one. Jennifer Egan's book, A Visit From the Goon Squad, won Fiction, even though it had already won a similar prize. Carol Guzy, a photographer from The Washington Post, became the first person to win four Pulitzer Prizes. \nÉlan vital is a concept from a book by a French man named Henri Bergson in 1907. He talked about how things, like living things, can organize and grow by themselves without being forced. Some people call it vital force and it's like an invisible energy that helps things develop and change. Bergson connected it with our understanding of the world and our inner experiences. \nTime and Free Will is a book written by Henri Bergson. It was his first big idea, which he shared in 1889. The book talks about a big question, called free will. Bergson thinks that philosophers are mixed up because they try to connect something that doesn't stretch (unextended) with something that does (extended). He uses this to explain his idea about how time works, which many people in Europe found very important later on. \nMoina Mathers, born as Mina Bergson, was a painter and someone who believed in mysterious things at the start of the 20th century. She was related to a famous French writer, Henri Bergson, who won a big prize for writing in 1927. People remember Moina more for marrying Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, who started a group called the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. After Samuel passed away in 1918, she led a new group called the Rosicrucian Order of the Alpha et Omega. \nMatter and Memory is a book by Henri Bergson, a French philosopher, published in 1896. It discusses the connection between the body and spirit, using the topic of memory to explore this relationship. Bergson wrote the book in response to Théodule Ribot's 1881 book, which suggested that memory is stored in the brain and is a material thing. Bergson disagreed with this idea, arguing that memory is a spiritual experience and not just a physical process. He believed that the brain helps us remember by connecting past experiences to guide our actions, but lesions can disrupt this function without fully erasing the memories."}], "output": "\nNeither Thomas Friedman nor Henri Bergson have won more Pulitzer Prizes.

It says that how good or bad an action is depends on how it affects others, not just the person doing it. James Fieser explains it like this: An action is good if it makes most people better off, except for the person doing it. Auguste Comte believed in being kind to others and living for their benefit. If someone follows these ideas, they are called an altruist. \nAlice Lloyd College is a school in Pippa Passes, Kentucky, where students live on campus.

The college is approved by an organization called Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). \nA work college in the US is a special kind of liberal arts school that combines work, learning, and service. Everyone studies and works there, not just those who need help. It's a public or private school that gives bachelor's degrees, and the school expects students to work a lot as part of their education. This is different from Federal Work Study, which only helps students who can't afford it. If a student doesn't do well in their work, they might get kicked out. They have to work, not pay to skip it. Students help run the school and feel like they own a part of it. This way, the school runs more smoothly and costs less, which makes the tuition lower for students. \nLiberal arts colleges are schools that focus on undergraduate education in subjects like arts, humanities, and sciences. They teach general knowledge and help students develop their thinking skills. This kind of education is different from training for specific jobs or technical skills. Liberal arts started in Europe, but it's mostly known in the US. You can find these colleges in many countries, and there's even a list of international ones that belong to a group called the Association of American Colleges and Universities. Liberal arts colleges teach many subjects to help students learn general knowledge and think broadly. They don't just teach one main thing, but also let students learn about different areas like sciences and humanities. This idea comes from Europe, but most liberal arts colleges in America are based on this way of learning. \nNancy K. Pearson is an American poet.

King Mpande ruled from 1840 to 1872. King Shaka, who was his half-brother and the Zulu leader, expanded the kingdom greatly by making it a powerful pre-colonial region in what is now KwaZulu-Natal, thanks to his policies and conquests. \nA cadet branch is like a smaller group in a family tree. It comes from the sons of a king or a leader who were born later, not the firstborn. In big families that rule or have special titles in Europe and Asia, usually, the main things like land, titles, and money are given to the firstborn son, not the younger brothers. These younger sons get less and pass it down to their own children in the future. \nThe Capetian dynasty, or House of France, is a royal family from France that started with Hugh Capet. They are one of the longest-lasting and biggest families in Europe and the world. It started when Hugh's male children continued the rule after he became king in 987.

The name Capetian came from the name of the first king, Hugh Capet. \nThe Duke of Leuchtenberg title was given twice by Bavaria's rulers. The first time, in 1799, Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria gave it to his son Maximilian Philipp Hieronymus when he died without kids. The land then went back to his nephew, Elector Maximilian II. Later, in 1817, King Maximilian I Joseph created the title again and gave it to his daughter's husband, Eugène de Beauharnais. Eugène was related to Napoleon I, the deposed Emperor, and was made his heir in Frankfurt and Italy.

He's the prince of Denmark, and his uncle, Claudius, took over the throne. Hamlet's dad, the old king, was killed, and he wants to avenge this. He's confused and unsure about how to do it, which makes him doubt his own mind. Sadly, throughout the play, Hamlet causes many deaths, including those of Polonius, Laertes, Claudius, and two friends. His love, Ophelia, also dies, and his mom, Gertrude, drinks something Claudius meant for her and passes away. \nMacbeth is a play by William Shakespeare that was first performed in 1606. It shows how trying too hard for power can be harmful, both physically and mentally. It was written when James I, who supported Shakespeare's acting company, was the king. This play is special because it reflects Shakespeare's connection to the king. It was first printed in a book called the Folio in 1623, and it's one of Shakespeare's shortest plays. \nA revenge tragedy, also known as revenge drama, is a type of play from early modern England. Ashley Thorndike, in a 1902 article, defined it as a play where the main reason is revenge and the story revolves around the person seeking revenge, usually leading to the deaths of the wrongdoers. An example is Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy from the 1580s. However, scholars now believe revenge tragedies started even earlier, in the 1560s, with plays like Troas by Jasper Heywood, who translated Seneca's works at Oxford. Gorbuduc by Thomas Norton and Sackville from 1561 is also considered a revenge tragedy. Some famous plays in this genre include William Shakespeare's Hamlet and Titus Andronicus, as well as Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy. \nShakespearean tragedy refers to the type of plays written by William Shakespeare. These include most of his plays, but some of his history plays, like Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra, were considered histories because they were about real people in English history. Roman tragedies, like Coriolanus, are also about historical figures but are mostly seen as tragedies due to their foreign and ancient sources. His romances, which are a mix of comedy and tragedy, were created later and were initially published as either tragedy or comedy. After Shakespeare, a scholar named F.S. Boas suggested a fifth category called problem plays for plays that don't fit into a simple category. People still discuss the exact classifications of some of Shakespeare's plays today. \nRory Williams is a TV character played by Arthur Darvill in a show called Doctor Who.

They all act in the film, like Sebastian Cabot as Lord Capulet and John Gielgud as the person who speaks in the story. \nJuliet Capulet, also known as Giulietta Capuleti, is the main female character in a play called Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare. She is the daughter of a very important man from the Capulet family. Juliet falls in love with Romeo, who belongs to a family called the Montagues. The Montagues and Capulets are not friends and have been fighting for a long time before Shakespeare wrote the story. \nAnna Devane is a pretend lady from a TV show called General Hospital.

He was the bass guitarist in the original Sex Pistols band. Even though he wasn't there when their famous album 'Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols' came out, people sometimes say he helped write 10 songs on it. After leaving the band, Steve Jones played bass for the album. Matlock still makes his own music and plays with other bands, including the Sex Pistols. \nExplanation: The paragraph is about a live album called Live at Winterland 1978 by the Avengers, which was released online in 2010. This album contains a performance from the Avengers at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco in 1978, where they opened for the Sex Pistols, a famous band. The Sex Pistols' final show before they reunited later happened that night. The album featuring the Sex Pistols' set is also called Live at Winterland 1978. Some songs from this album were already available on two older bootlegs called Penelope and Summer of Hate.\n\nRevised paragraph: Live at Winterland 1978 is a live album by the Avengers, released in 2010. It has a recording from their show at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco on January 14, 1978, when they played before the Sex Pistols, a band that later reunited. The Sex Pistols' performance from that night is also on an album. Some songs from this album were previously found on two bootlegs, 'Penelope' and 'Summer of Hate'.\n\nThis version simplifies the original text by removing technical terms, clarifying the connection between the Avengers and the Sex Pistols' sets, and providing a clearer overview of the existing bootlegs. \nThe Idols and Sid Vicious concert album, featuring the late Sex Pistols bassist, was recorded in 1978 but didn't come out until 1993.

The album was first released by the New Rose Fan Club and later in Japan by Teichiku Records, who got permission from New Rose to distribute it. \nBodies is a song by the Sex Pistols from their 1977 album Never Mind the Bollocks. It's about the shock of abortion and has strong, explicit language talking about a fetus. In the third verse, the word fuck is repeated five times very quickly. This song, along with Belsen Was a Gas, is known for being the most graphic and controversial due to its topic and the way it's sung. The music is fast and loud, with drums beating hard, guitars sounding like buzzsaws, and loud vocals. This type of fast, intense music helped pave the way for genres like hardcore, thrash, and speed metal that became popular in the 1980s. \nNancy Spungen, born on February 27, 1958, was a girlfriend of Sid Vicious, the bassist of the Sex Pistols. She was part of the punk rock scene in the 1970s. People who study music history and are fans of the Sex Pistols have debated about her life and what happened to her, which has caused some confusion. Nancy passed away on October 12, 1978. \nExplanation: The Ex Pistols were a fake band created in 1979 by Dave Goodman, a man who used to work with the real Sex Pistols. He made this band when he took over their production instead of the real professionals. The Ex Pistols sounded like the real band, had the same name, and used similar artwork to trick people into thinking their songs were new or from the Sex Pistols, but they weren't. \nRevolution in the Classroom is a song by a group called the Ex Pistols, but it's not actually about the band called the Sex Pistols. It was released in 1989 on a record label called STP Records, and it comes in different colors of vinyl. This song and its B-side Schools Are Prisons were on an album called Deny. Some people might think they are real Sex Pistols songs when they see them on two albums made by the band's old producer, Dave Goodman, called Pirates of Destiny and We Have Cum For Your Children. The song has also been included on a German Sex Pistols compilation album called Anarchy in the USA in 1992. If you look for it, it's CD 084-60322 or LP 008-60321. \nThe Ex Pistols album called The Swindle Continues came out in 1988.

Tail docking is more common, but tailing is also used. People call the part of the tail where hair grows the dock because it's the living flesh. \nTensile testing, also called tension testing, is a basic test in materials science. It involves stretching a sample under controlled tension until it breaks. The information from this test helps choose materials for specific jobs, makes sure they're good, and shows how they behave under normal pressure. The test measures things like how strong a material is (ultimate tensile strength), how much it stretches (maximum elongation), and how its shape changes (reduction in area). Other properties like Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, yield strength, and how it gets harder to stretch (strain-hardening) can also be found. For most regular materials, uniaxial testing is used. But for materials that have different strength in different directions, like composites or textiles, biaxial testing is needed. \nAn STOLport, or STOLPORT, is a special airport made for planes that can take off and land short, usually for smaller planes of their size. In simple words, it has a short runway, less than 5000 feet, and only accepts specific types of planes with limited fuel. In the US, they used to call such short-runway airports airports and not STOLports anymore since the 1970s. The term STOLport was not commonly used by 2008. It was mentioned for a time when a place called Biggin Hill had limited airplane access in 1986-87 because of a nearby airport. \nTrickle valves, also called vacuum valves, are used in big machines to clean up dust. They help keep the dust collector from losing air while letting the dust go out. They are cheaper than other machines that use motors to move. These valves don't need electricity to work, which makes them perfect for machines that need to be dust-free to work well, like trenchers. Trickle valves were made for this job. \nMethyltestosterone, known by brands like Agovirin and Android, is a medicine that helps make men's bodies produce more testosterone. It's used when a man doesn't have enough and for other reasons too. Some people use it to look better or perform better in sports, even though it's not as popular as other similar medicines. It was made in 1935, not long after people found out about testosterone. Even today, it's still used as a treatment. \nThe Belling-Lee connector, also called Type 9,52 in IEC 61169-2, is a special kind of radio-frequency coaxial cable connector used in Europe and Australia. It's often called a PAL antenna connector, IEC antenna connector, or simply a TV aerial plug. This connector is used to connect coaxial cables, rooftop TV antennas, amplifiers, cable systems, TVs, and even FM and DAB radios. It's one of the connectors still commonly used in everyday devices, even though there are newer ones. \nMetandienone, also called Averbol, Dianabol, Danabol, or Metanabol, is a medicine that was made to help people, but it's not used anymore. It's a special kind of steroid that makes people stronger and helps with sports. People also use it without permission to improve their performance. \nPox is a special drink that the people in Mexico and Central America use for special events. It's made from corn, sugar, and wheat and holds a lot of importance in their culture. They call it aguardiente. Not only is it used in special religious ceremonies, but it's also a little bit popular in a place called Chiapas. The word Pox means medicine or a cure in the Tzotzil language.

It belongs to a family called Rubiaceae and is from New Zealand. People often call it tree bedstraw, taupata, mirror bush, looking-glass bush, New Zealand laurel, or shiny leaf. \n Nitrogen assimilation is when plants, fungi, and some bacteria turn nitrogen from the air into something they can use, like amino acids. They do this because they can't fix nitrogen gas on their own. Animals, on the other hand, get their nitrogen from the organic food they eat, which already contains nitrogen that was fixed by plants or other organisms. \nParkia timoriana, also known as tree bean, is a type of flowering plant in the legume family. Its different names in various languages include petai hutan in Borneo, yongchak in Manipur, and so on. This plant is native to Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, and Assam in India. People grow it a lot for food, wood, and as a decoration. \nThe poem starts by talking about a big tree, called the Casuarina Tree. The tree has a creeper, like a snake, that has climbed around it and left deep marks. The tree is very strong and can handle the creeper's hold. It's like a brave and gallant friend, because not many trees can survive with it around. The tree is so big and strong, it looks like a giant with red flowers on it.\n\nAt night, the tree's garden is full of life, and a nightingale's song never stops. In the morning, a gray baboon and its young ones play near it. The tree's shadow even falls on a big water tank.\n\nToru Dutt, the poet, loves the tree a lot because she and her siblings had happy times under it. She wants to remember the tree and protect it from being forgotten, just like Wordsworth remembered the Yew trees. She hopes that love will keep the tree's memory alive. \nDavey Tree, or the Davey Tree Expert Company, is a big company in the US and Canada that takes care of trees, helps with utility problems, mows lawns, and gives advice on the environment. They've been around since 1880 and are the first national company to do this kind of work. Their founder, John Davey, is famous for starting the study of tree surgery. They offer many services like tree and utility fixes, moving big trees, managing commercial spaces, and consulting. The company has been owned by its workers since 1979, and it's the biggest employee-owned company in Ohio and one of the 20 biggest in the whole country. They separate their work into two parts: Residential and Commercial, and Utility. \nThe Bottle tree, also known as Pachypodium lealii Welw., is a type of plant in the Pachypodium family. It got its name from a Portuguese scientist, Fernando da Costa Leal, who found it during a trip to southern Angola in the 1800s. \nA weak heap is a mix of two types of data structures, binary heap and binomial heap, used for making priority queues. It can be organized like an array, like a binary heap, and also has the speed benefits of a binomial heap. \nDurvillaea willana is a kelp plant that lives in milder coastal areas than D. antarctica. It has smaller leaves and is usually found closer to the beach because it can't handle strong waves as well. People in New Zealand sometimes mistake it for bull kelp, which has bigger blades. The plant has thick, long stems with small fronds on the sides, making it look like a tree. The fronds are not hollow like D. antarctica's, and the base, called the holdfast, grows big and spreads flat on rocks."}], "output": "\nYes, both Stenocereus and Pachypodium can include tree-like plants. Stenocereus is mentioned as a type of plant, while Pachypodium is specifically described as a plant in the Pachypodium family, known as the Bottle tree. Both are classified as succulents that can have a shrubby or tree-like growth habit.**"},

They work on making sure kids don't get too fat by looking at big companies that make unhealthy foods and drinks easily available, schools not having enough healthy food, cities not friendly to walking or biking, and places for kids to play being unsafe. They have a website called Kickthecan.info that asks big drink companies to join in making things better. They support bills to tax sugary drinks, like one from Bill Monning in 2013. The person in charge, Harold Goldstein, wrote about the good of soda taxes and even wrote articles for newspapers and a university.

He was an important figure before Carissimi at the Collegium Germanicum. He created six special talks about the Bible, called Gospel Dialogues, for a place called the oratory. He also taught another musician named Benevoli. \nTomasso Giovanni Albinoni, born on June 8, 1671, and passed away on January 17, 1751, was a composer from Italy known for his Baroque music. Although he was popular for operas during his time, he is mainly remembered for his instrumental pieces, like the concerti. \n Luigi Rossi was a musician from Italy, born around 1597 in Torremaggiore, near Foggia. When he was young, he went to Naples to learn music. He studied with a famous composer named Jean de Macque, who was in charge of the church's music at Santa Casa dell'Annunziata and worked for the Spanish viceroy.

He started as a professional in 2010 and has previously fought for Bellator and CES MMA. \n\nExplanation: \n1. Simplified the birthdate to make it easier to understand.\n2. Removed currently competing since it's not necessary for the basic information.\n3. Changed formerly competed for to has previously fought for clarity.\n4. Mentioned the weight division he competes in for clarity. \nDonald West VanArtsdalen, sometimes spelled Van Artsdalen, was born on October 21, 1919. He is a very important judge, called a Senior United States District Judge, who works for a special court in a place called the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. This court handles legal cases in that area. \nMister Pipeline is a special name given to the best surfers at Pipeline on the North Shore. Butch Van Artsdalen was the first one to get this title, and they pass it on to other talented surfers who are chosen by everyone. Some famous people like Gerry Lopez, who acts sometimes, and Mike Stewart, who is great at bodyboarding, have also received this title. \nSkimboarding is a fun water sport where a small, finless board is used to ride on the surface of the water and catch breaking waves. It's like surfing, but without the big waves. Skimmers do cool tricks like wrapping around the wave, spinning, and jumping in the air. They start by dropping the board on the waves and use their speed to catch and ride them back to the beach. Sometimes, they also do tricks on the flat parts of the water, like in skateboarding. This sport started in California because the waves there were too strong for regular surfboards. Now, skimboarders can ride big waves and even be pulled by boats called waverunners. A professional skimboarder named Brad Domke showed off a new trick in a video. \nTow-in surfing is a way for surfers to catch bigger, faster waves using a special helper, like a boat or watercraft, instead of just paddling. This helps them go beyond the usual 30-foot waves. It's a big change in surfing and has been a major improvement. \nWaimea Canyon, often called the Grand Canyon of the Pacific, is a big canyon on the side of Kaua'i, a place in Hawaii, United States. It's about 10 miles long and as deep as 3,000 feet. The canyon got its name from the red soil that comes from the river, Waimea, which cuts deep because it rains a lot on the island's high point, Mount Waiʻaleʻale, which is one of the wettest places on Earth. \nWaimea is a name found in both Hawaii and New Zealand. In Hawaiian, it means reddish water, but in Maori, the language spoken in New Zealand, the name doesn't have a specific meaning. It could refer to a place or a thing in either culture. \nLake surfing is when you ride waves on a big lake, like a swimming pool, but instead of the ocean. To have fun waves, the wind needs to blow from the other side. But on a lake, the waves go away fast, so you have less time to catch them. Ocean surfers usually ride waves that came from storms far away, while lake surfers might surf in the same storm. The waves can be rough, and you have to paddle through them because there aren't long breaks between them. Paddling is harder because the water is not as thick, and you don't have to worry about sharks or other sea creatures. But you do get to enjoy clean, freshwater and no marine life to worry about."}], "output": "\nButch Van Artsdalen was known for surfing 25-foot waves at Waimea Canyon in Hawaii.**"},

He is also one of the wealthiest people in Barbados where he resides now. \nThe Arisaka rifle, made in Japan during World War II, was created by Italy, which is why it's called Type I (not a number, just Italian). After Japan invaded China, they only used this rifle for their army, so they asked Italy for more under a special agreement in 1937. The Type I is similar to the Type 38 rifle but has a special magazine. It was mostly used by the Japanese Navy. It uses a 6.5 x 50 mm cartridge. In 1938 and 1939, about 120,000 were made, with 40,000 made by Beretta and the rest by Italian factories. The last shipment went to Japan by submarine in 1941. \nEugene O'Kelly, a former KPMG CEO and Chairman, wrote a book called Chasing Daylight which is a mix of his life story and advice on facing death without fear or sadness.

The book won an award from the Financial Times and serves as a guide on how to make the last moments count. \nThe QBB-95 is a lighter version of the Type 95 gun made in China. It's similar to the QBZ-95, which most soldiers in the Chinese army use. You can swap some parts and bullets between them. The QBB-95 comes in different forms like a regular rifle, a smaller carbine, and a special light weapon that shoots a lot at once. It has a longer barrel and can hold 80 rounds, but it can also use the usual 30-round magazines. \nEugene Cross Park is a place in Ebbw Vale, Wales where people play rugby and cricket. In 1919, a group called the Ebbw Vale Welfare Association bought a field called Bridgend Field. They changed the name to Welfare Ground when it was 6 acres big. In 1973, they renamed it after a man named Sir Eugene Cross, who was in charge for a long time. The park has places to sit, a new stand because the old ones burned down, and a club house with a pub, a shop, and nice food. It's close to a road, a road called Newchurch Road, and a river called Ebbw River. \nEdward Eugene Cox, also known as Goober Cox, was a U.S. Representative from Georgia for 28 years. He was a conservative Democrat who supported segregation and didn't agree with President Roosevelt's New Deal. Cox became the most senior Democrat on the House Committee on Rules. However, he was criticized for two committees he led, which were seen as targeting people he didn't like. In 1941, when America was about to enter World War II, Cox wanted to create another committee to investigate national defense. But President Roosevelt created a similar committee first, which later became very important under Harry S. Truman, who became Vice President and later President. \nThe Type 4 Rifle, sometimes called the Type 5, was a special Japanese rifle made to copy the American M1 Garand. It had a built-in magazine that held 10 rounds, not the clips used in the Garand. It used Japanese bullets and had sights like their own. This rifle was made at the same time as other similar ones. But, because of some problems with it, like it wouldn't work well, none of them were used during World War II. Only 250 were made and many were never finished. \nEugene Black, born on May 1, 1898, and passed away in 1992, was the leader of the World Bank from 1949 to 1963. His father, who worked as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve in the 1930s and also had the same name, didn't add Sr. to his name.

It was trying to land on runway 06 at around 2:04 PM local time, but the plane hit trees too close to the runway and stopped on the ground 3 meters below. The pilot and co-pilot died, and another person got hurt. The visibility was low because of ground fog, and runway 06 is a runway where pilots can only land by seeing, not using instruments. \nFedEx Express Flight 80 was a plane that was supposed to fly from China to Japan. On March 23, 2009, it had an accident during landing in strong winds. The plane went up and down, broke, and caught fire after landing off the runway. The people inside, the pilot and copilot, didn't survive. \nOn March 7, 2007, Garuda Indonesia Flight 200, a Boeing 737-400, was a regular flight from Jakarta to Yogyakarta in Indonesia.

LeRoy survived the initial attack and tried to stop the hijackers. During the hijacking, he and the co-pilot, Dahl, prevented the plane from reaching Washington D.C. by disengaging autopilot and using the radio to communicate with air traffic controllers instead. When they found out about the other plane crashes, they tried to take back control of the plane.

Plumb is known for his coaching roles with two exceptional teams that won Super Bowl titles - the 1985 Bears and the 2000 St. Louis Rams. He worked as the Wide Receivers Coach for the Chicago Bears and the Director of Pro Scouting for the Rams. After coaching the Rams to victory in 2000, he retired to his home in Alba, Texas. \nThe Super Bowl XXXVII was a big football game in 2002 between two teams, the Oakland Raiders from the American Football Conference and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from the National Football Conference. The Buccaneers won and became the NFL champions. They won by 27 points, which was the seventh biggest win in Super Bowl history. It was played on January 26, 2003, in San Diego, California, and it was the last Super Bowl in January. The next one was in February because of some important events.

In North Carolina, it starts near a river called the Pigeon River Gorge, coming from Tennessee. It goes through many places like mountains, hilly areas, towns, busy cities, and farmland before ending in Wilmington. The whole road is 423.55 miles long, which makes it the longest highway in the state. There are other roads nearby I-40 that are also part of it, and there's a special road in Winston-Salem that goes around it. The road is called east-west, but the part from Hillsboro to Wilmington is a bit tilted to the north-south direction. \nIn New York, there are 32 highways called Interstate Highways. These roads are either entirely or partly in the state. The state's transportation group, called NYSDOT, takes care of most of them. But, they don't use the number of the highway directly. Instead, they add the letter 'I' to the number on signs and papers. This might make it seem like some numbers are the same for both highways and state routes, like I-86 and NY 86, but the 'I' tells them apart. \nExplanation: The highways in Illinois that are part of the Interstate Highway System are owned and taken care of by the state of Illinois. The group in charge of keeping these roads clean and well-maintained is the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT). There are 13 main highways and 11 helper ones in the state, covering a total of 2,248.93 miles. The longest highway in Illinois is Interstate 57, which is 358.57 miles long, while the shortest one, Interstate 41, is only 0.90 miles. \n\nRevised paragraph: The highways in Illinois that belong to the Interstate Highway System are managed by the state of Illinois. The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) is responsible for maintaining them. The system has 13 primary roads and 11 auxiliary ones, stretching for 2,248.93 miles. The longest highway, I-57, is 358.57 miles, while the shortest, I-41, is just 0.90 miles. There are 16 Interstate Highways in Maryland, out of which 6 are primary and 10 are auxiliary. I-95 is the longest primary at 110.01 miles, while I-81 is the shortest, at 12.08 miles. I-97, 17.62 miles long, is both the shortest primary and the shortest intrastate. I-695 is the longest auxiliary, at 51.48 miles. The shortest auxiliary is I-295, 0.80 miles. The highways, except for some parts, are taken care of by the Maryland State Highway Administration. I-595, a unsigned highway, runs as US 50 and US 301. I-170, no longer an interstate, is shown in dark gray in the list. \nWhen the Utah State Legislature started planning for more highways in Utah, they made some changes to the system. They mainly did this by deciding on route numbers 1 to 5 for future highways in the Interstate Highway System, but these changes were not seen by the public. They also made slight adjustments to some roads for state parks and institutions. Some routes were shortened, changed, or divided to give the main highways clean numbers. Since not much of the Interstate Highway System was built in Utah by 1962, these changes were mostly for future projects. Over time, more changes were made as the highways were built. In 1977, the legislature made a big change by getting rid of unused route designations. \nExplanation: The auxiliary Interstate Highways, often called three-digit ones, are extra highways within the big network of freeways in the US called the Interstate Highway System. Just like main highways, they follow all the same rules (with a few exceptions), get the same amount of money from the government (90%), and meet federal rules. \n\nRevised Paragraph: These highways, known as auxiliary Interstate Highways, are part of the bigger US Interstate System. They are similar to main highways and follow all Interstate standards, except for a few cases. They also get 90% federal funding and adhere to federal rules. \nIn Texas, the highways called Interstate Highways are owned and kept by the state. The group in charge of fixing and making them work every day is the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). Texas has 3,239.7 miles of these highways. There are 12 main roads and 7 helper roads. One main road, I-35, is split into two parts, I-35E and I-35W, to help people go to Fort Worth and Dallas. The longest part of these highways is I-10, which is 878.6 miles long, and the shortest is I-110, which is only 0.9 miles long. \nInterstate 85 (I-85) is a big road in the US that starts in Alabama and goes all the way to Virginia. In Virginia, it's 68.64 miles long and starts near a place called Bracey, then goes to Petersburg. It runs close to another road called US 1, especially in the eastern part of Southside Virginia. When it gets to South Hill, it meets US 58, a main road there. This road helps connect people between Richmond-Petersburg and big cities in North Carolina, like the Research Triangle. It's a very important part of the big roads system in the whole country."}], "output": "\nThe town at the intersection of Interstate Highways 77 and the longest Interstate highway within the borders of Virginia, which is I-95, is Petersburg.**"},

They started in the 1900s and have grown in Southern California. During a time called Prohibition, they made a lot of money by selling illegal alcohol. They were at their strongest in the 1940s and 1950s with a man named Jack Dragna, but they were not as big as the families in New York or Chicago. Now, the group is slowly getting smaller and the Chicago Outfit helps them make decisions like other families. \nJoseph Baldie LoPiccolo, born in 1918 and passed away in 1999, was a man from the United States who was involved in criminal activities. He was part of the New York Gambino crime family and worked under Santo Trafficante Jr., another big boss, for his criminal activities. His main job was dealing with illegal drugs. \nThe Italian American One Voice Coalition is a group that fights against prejudice. They want to protect and share Italian American culture and history by teaching, making laws, and speaking up. They want to show a strong, united front to stop false things about Italian Americans and protect them from being treated unfairly. This is the only national group like theirs. \nExplanation: \n\nOperation Power Outage was a special police operation to catch and charge people from an Armenian American group called Armenian Power, who were doing illegal things in the United States. They are blamed for things like cheating in banks, kidnapping, and dealing drugs. Armenian Power, also known as AP-13, started in a neighborhood called East Hollywood 20 years ago and now has more than 200 members. They have grown from just a street gang into a big criminal group that works across the world. \nThe Sopranos is a TV show about a man named Tony Soprano, who is a boss in a pretend New Jersey mob. He's Italian-American and tries to be both a good husband and a criminal. He talks to a doctor about his problems. The show shows his family, friends, and enemies, especially his wife and a young helper, in the story. \nThe Mexican Mafia, or La eMe, is a criminal group from the United States, not Mexico. They are mostly made up of Mexican Americans and are found in prisons. The group uses the number 13 to show they are loyal to the Mexican Mafia, because M is the 13th letter of the alphabet. The Mexican Mafia is considered the strongest gang in California's prison system. There are about 155 to 300 official members and around 990 helpers who want to become full members by helping the group with illegal activities. \nThe National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame is a special group that celebrates great American athletes who are part of Italian culture. George Randazzo started a similar group, the Italian American Boxing Hall of Fame, in 1977 to raise money for kids in Catholic groups. After a successful first year, he decided to turn it into the bigger National Italian American Sports Hall of Fame. It started in a place called Elmwood Park, Illinois. They first honored some famous people like Lou Ambers, Eddie Arcaro, and Charley Trippi at a big event. Since it was created in 1978, over 230 Italian-American athletes have been honored in this hall. \nThe Barrow Gang was a group of criminals in the US from 1932 to 1934. They were famous for robbing small places like stores and gas stations, not big banks, during the Great Depression. They were so well-known that people called it the public enemy era.

Unfortunately, no of his paintings survive today. \nPaul Androuet du Cerceau, born in 1623 and died in 1710, was a French person who made things with gold and pictures. He worked in Paris around 1610. Some people think he might be the son of a famous architect named Jean Baptiste, who built the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris. But now, it's believed he might be the grandson of another person named Jacques II. \nJacques I Androuet du Cerceau, also known as Du Cerceau or Ducerceau, was a famous French designer in the 1600s. He created architecture, decorations, furniture, and metalwork. He brought Renaissance style to France with help from other designers like Lescot, Delorme, and Bullant.

In the 1760s and 1770s, 25 more of these ships were built like it. She was put in the water on November 21, 1767. For a short time, from 1779 to 1783, she had a different name, HMS Explosion, and was used as a大火船. She fought in two big wars, the American Revolution and the French Revolution, and then in 1801, she stopped working and was put away. Finally, in 1814, she was sold to be taken apart. \nVice-Admiral Robert Plampin, a British Navy officer, was active in wars from the late 1700s to early 1800s. He took part in the American Revolutionary War, French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars. He's most recognized for his time as the leader of Saint Helena, a British colony in the South Atlantic, when Napoleon Bonaparte was being held captive there. Born into a naval family, Plampin joined the Navy at 13 and fought in the Caribbean Sea during the American Revolution.

These engines are a type of external combustion engine that uses valves and works with a single phase gas, like hot air. The engine originally used air as its internal working fluid, but now, other gases like helium or hydrogen can be used too. \nCharles Stephen Boreham was a shearer and unionist from New Zealand. He was born on December 19, 1857, in Richmond, Tasmania, Australia. \nThe gas-generator cycle is a part of a rocket engine. It uses some propellant to create hot gas in a separate part, called a gas generator. This hot gas helps to move the engine's pumps. Then, the used gas is sent out. Because propellant is wasted, this engine is called open cycle. \nAn external combustion engine (EC engine) is a type of engine where the fuel is burned outside the engine, either through the engine wall or a heat exchanger. This heats up a working fluid inside the engine. When the fluid expands, it makes the engine move and creates energy. After that, the fluid is cooled, compressed, and reused in the engine (closed cycle), or sometimes, it's let out and new cool fluid comes in (open cycle air engine). \nA working fluid is like a helper that moves a machine. It can be either a pressurized gas or liquid, like steam in a steam engine or air in a hot air balloon. It's also used in things like hydraulic motors or cylinders, where it carries energy. In simple words, in a thermodynamic system, a working fluid is a liquid or gas that helps transfer energy. \nCeladon Leeds Daboll, from New London, Connecticut, made a special kind of foghorn called a Daboll trumpet. It was like a small engine that burned coal to heat up air. This engine put air in a tube with a reed on top, which made a loud noise when blown. \nPiccard Balloons, along with other companies like Raven Industries, SEMCO, and The Balloon Works (now Firefly Balloons), started making hot air balloons a long time ago. Don Piccard, who had a family of flyers, started making and selling modern hot air balloons in the 1960s. They were really good at it and helped make the sport of hot air ballooning better with new ideas and building techniques. \nA Manson-Guise engine is an upgraded version of a Manson engine, which uses hot air to make things move. It has two sides, hot and cold, and will work if the hot side is much hotter than the cold. It's a simple engine with only one rod, where both the moving part (displacer piston) and the one that makes power move together. One special thing about it is, it can go in either direction, like a spinning wheel that can turn clockwise or counterclockwise."}], "output": "\nThe prolific English engineer who contributed to the advent of the hot air engine through their open cycle devices and died on 15 December 1857 is not mentioned in the provided passage.

It's not a scientific paper, but it's made by groups of dog lovers called breed clubs. These rules can be different from place to place and club to club. It's like having rules for other animals kept as pets, too. \nExplanation: A big dog type doesn't have a specific size rule, but usually, one that's really big should weigh more than 50 kg.

Because of this, younger people in rural areas often speak a more modern London accent, while the older generation still uses the traditional rural dialect. In other parts of Essex, the dialect still exists. \nFrom 1974 to 1996, Humberside was a place in Northern England where things were managed but not a big city. It was made up of parts from three nearby places: East Riding of Yorkshire, West Riding of Yorkshire, and Lindsey in Lincolnshire. The main office for the county was at County Hall in Beverley, and the biggest city was Kingston upon Hull. The area went from one side of the Humber Estuary in the north to the other in the south. Even though it's not a county anymore, it still affects the area around the Hull and Humber Ports. \nThe Cumbrian dialect, which is a type of local English spoken in Cumbria and nearby areas, is slowly disappearing. This dialect is different from the old Celtic language called Cumbric, which is no longer used. The accent in Cumbria sounds more like the North-East English one, and it also shares a lot of words with Scots. There are two books available to help understand and learn about the dialect: A Cumbrian Dictionary of Dialect, Tradition, and Folklore by William Rollinson, and a newer, funnier one called A Contemporary Cumbrian Dictionary and Phrase Book. \nThe Humber Forts are two big structures by the Humber estuary in the north of England. One is called Haile Sand Fort and the other is Bull Sand Fort. \nThe M180 is a 25-mile motorway in England. It starts at junction 5 on the M18 and goes close to Humberside Airport. From there, it helps connect people to places like Cleethorpes, Grimsby, Hull, Immingham, Lincoln, Scunthorpe, and two oil refineries. It's also part of a special road called Euroroute E22. It's the longest motorway in the UK with a number like this. \nThe Humber Warhawks are a football team from Hull, a place in England. They play in a league called BAFA NFC South 2. They choose their name because they are near the Humber River, which separates East Yorkshire and North East Lincolnshire, and the Humber Bridge connects them. The team started in 2014 when two other teams, Kingston Warhawks and Grimsby Scorpions, joined together. They became official in 2015 and started playing in that season."}], "output": "\nThe northern English Anglian dialect spoken in the Humber estuary is similar to the Suffolk and Norfolk dialects and is referred to as Essex dialect.**"},

John Bowman, born on December 17, 1738, and died in May 4, 1784, was a pioneer from the 18th century. He worked as a colonial militia officer and the first sheriff in Lincoln County, Kentucky. In 1781, he was in charge of the first county court in Kentucky. During the American Revolutionary War, he was the county-lieutenant and military governor of Kentucky County. He was a key figure in the Illinois Campaign, where he helped double the size of the United States by serving under General George Rogers Clark. \nBenjamin Logan, born around 1742 and died in December 1802, was a very important person from Kentucky. He was a pioneer, a soldier, and a helper in making Kentucky a state. During a big fight called the American Revolutionary War, he was in charge of a group of guards in Kentucky, and his brother John Logan was the first person to be in charge of money in the state. \nThe Battle of Blue Licks, that took place on August 19, 1782, was the final big fight in the American Revolutionary War. It happened after a important event called the surrender at Yorktown where the war in the east basically ended. It happened near a river called Licking, in a place now called Robertson County, Kentucky, but back then it was in Kentucky County, Virginia. A group of about 50 people who supported the British and some Canadian ones, along with 300 Native Americans, surprised and defeated 182 Kentucky soldiers. This was the last time the Loyalists and Native Americans had a victory during the war on the front lines. \nJohn Logan was a man from Virginia and Kentucky who lived between 1747 and 1807. In 1774, he joined a group led by his brother, Benjamin, during a conflict called Lord Dunmore's War. After moving to Kentucky, he went on trips with famous people like Daniel Boone and George Rogers Clark to fight against the Shawnee. When Kentucky County split into three, Logan represented his home county, Lincoln, in the Virginia House of Delegates and helped decide to separate Virginia from Kentucky at some meetings. \nTara Conner, born on December 18, 1985, is an American actress, model, and beauty queen. She became Miss USA in 2006 and has also participated in Miss Teen USA and Miss Universe contests. Apart from her Miss USA title, she has worked as a model. In 2004, she was shown on a TV show called Bikini Destinations, modeling in Lake Tahoe. She has won other titles like Miss Kentucky Teen USA in 2002, Miss Kentucky County Fair in 2004, and Miss Kentucky USA in 2006. \nCasey County is a place in Kentucky, a state in the United States. In 2010, there were 15,955 people living there. The main office in the county is called Liberty. Casey County was created in 1806 from a part of another county called Lincoln County. It was named for a man named William Casey, who moved his family to Kentucky in 1779. This is the only county in Kentucky that is all in a part called the Knobs. The county has an Apple Festival every year. It follows a rule called prohibition or being dry, which means no selling alcohol. Casey County is part of a group of places in Kentucky called the Appalachian region. \nIn 1776, Virginia made a change by dividing Fincastle County into three new counties: Kentucky, Washington, and Montgomery. This happened on December 31. While Kentucky County existed for a little over three years, its main place where people went for government work was Harrodstown, which was also called Oldtown and later changed to Harrodsburg. \nThe Westervelt massacre, also called the Westerfield massacre, was a violent event where Native Americans attacked a group of Dutch settlers in Kentucky County, Virginia (now Kentucky), during the American Revolutionary War. It happened on June 27, 1780, early in the morning. This was one of the biggest massacres in Kentucky's history. The settlers were moving from a place called Low Dutch Station to a safer place called Harrod's Town to avoid British Captain Henry Bird's army. The attack took place at night after they had traveled 12 miles.\n\nThe exact spot of the massacre is not exactly known, but it probably happened near Floyd's Fork and Broad Run. There were 41 settlers from different families in the caravan, and 17 of them were from the Westervelt family. Sadly, 10 out of the 17 settlers lost their lives, including both adults and children.\n\nThe attackers were Native Americans who were working with the British. For every scalp they took and returned to the British, they were paid £5. For the 10 Westervelt victims, that totalled £85. This event scared the people in the area, and many settlers from Low Dutch Station joined a group called Colonel George Rogers Clark's militia."}], "output": "\nThe Kentucky county with a population of 60,316 and featuring the Lake Louisvilla neighborhood is not mentioned in the passage provided.

They started a shopping center in 1990 and had 270,000 acres by then. They owned part of what became Lake James State Park, but later sold it to the state. In 2006, Duke Energy sold its part to Morgan Stanley, and Crescent Resources became a separate company. In 2009, they went bankrupt but came out of it. In 2013, they changed their name to Crescent Communities to focus on development. \nExplanation: Progress Energy, a big energy company based in Raleigh, North Carolina, was a part of Duke Energy.

He was born into a family of builders and had kids named Robert and George. His brother, John, was also an engineer. He had some relatives who were also in the building business, like an uncle, Joseph, who was an architect in London, and another uncle, William, who was an architect in Dublin. He created a theater called Theatre Royal on Henry Street. From the 1870s until he passed away, he worked with his son Robert in a company called Joseph Fogerty & Son. \nJohn Fogerty was a person who worked as a builder, architect, and civil engineer in Limerick a long time ago, in the 1800s. He had brothers and sons who were also in similar jobs. He stopped being an architect in the 1870s or 1879. \nAlmost Saturday Night is a song written by John Fogerty. It came out in 1975 on his album. It was released as a single but didn't do very well, reaching number 78.

Even though they've been playing women's soccer since 1998, the country's top teams are for kids under 17 and 19. Building a national team is tough like in many African countries, but there are four people working on it. \nThe EAFF E-1 Football Championship is a soccer event in East Asia for countries in that region. It's for both men's and women's national teams, they play together. \nThe EAFF E-1 Football Championship, which used to be called the East Asian Football Championship from 2003 to 2010 and the EAFF East Asian Cup for 2013 and 2015, is a competition for men's national soccer teams in East Asia. It started in 2002 when the East Asian Football Federation (EAFF) was created. Before the EAFF existed, there was a competition called the Dynasty Cup, played between the top four teams in the region, which was considered the unofficial championship.

In 2014, she was honored into the Canadian Soccer Hall of Fame. \nIn the 1929-30 season, the British Home Championship, a yearly competition among British countries, took place. However, a big change happened that year. The 1930 FIFA World Cup, a major international football event, was started in Uruguay. But, the British Home Nations, who were the hosts, weren't allowed to join because they had disagreements with FIFA about the growing professionalism in football in other parts of the world. Because of this, they didn't participate and said they wouldn't even if invited, as they thought foreign teams weren't strong enough to challenge them.\n\nIt's interesting to think about what might have happened if the British teams had played in the World Cup. For example, England, who were great in the Home Championship, had already lost to Spain, and they didn't do well against Germany and Austria in the same year. Scotland, which had won most of the previous championships, wasn't ready either, as they only played outside the British Isles for the first time in 1929 and lost to strong teams like Austria and Italy in 1931 on tour. \nThe L'Alcúdia International Football Tournament in 2016 was a special soccer event for young teams only. It happened in July and August of that year. It was the first time they didn't have teams from clubs or different countries playing together in the past. \nThe Togo women's soccer team, also known as the Togo Féminine de Football, started playing in 2006. They are managed by Fédération Togolaise de Football, the organization in charge of soccer in Togo. This team has only played five games recognized by FIFA, all in 2006. Their coach is Paul Zoungbede. The team's home field is Stade de Kégué, located in Lomé. \nThe Women's Nordic Football Championship was a competition where teams from the Nordic countries, like Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, played soccer.

It explains Freud's idea about dreams, which comes from his idea about the unconscious mind. The book also talks about a thing called the Oedipus complex. Freud changed the book many times and in the third edition, he added a part that looks very closely at the symbols in dreams, because of another person named Wilhelm Stekel. Freud said this was a very special and rare kind of understanding. \nFreud: A Life for Our Time is a biography about Sigmund Freud, who started psychoanalysis, written by Peter Gay, a historian. It was made in 1988 and includes information that wasn't in Ernest Jones' book from 1953. Some people like it, but others who don't believe in psychoanalysis have criticized it. \nHamlet, a play by Shakespeare, started in the 17th century and is still famous, copied, and studied a lot. It's known for a character named Hamlet who was important in understanding a thing called the Oedipus complex, which helps with understanding how people feel. This play also has a big effect on how people think about life, and many people think of Hamlet when they hear his name. Other writers also use his character as an example. \nPaul Ricœur wrote a book called Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation in 1965, which talks about Sigmund Freud. This book is sometimes put together with another book by Jürgen Habermas. Some people think it's good, but others say Ricœur didn't understand Freud correctly. \nThe book The Assault on Truth by Jeffrey Masson discusses how Sigmund Freud, a famous psychologist, didn't want to accept that children can be hurt by sexual abuse during their early years. He hid a theory he had, called the seduction theory, which said this was the cause of a condition called hysteria. Masson found this out by looking at some private letters Freud had that were not publicly known. The book first came out in 1984 and has been updated many times since. \nRichard Webster's book Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science, and Psychoanalysis (first published in 1995, updated in 1996 and 2005) is a critique of Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis. The author claims that Freud became an influential figure and that psychoanalysis is not a reliable science, but rather a blend of religious beliefs. Webster uses arguments from Gilbert Ryle's book The Concept of Mind (1949) against mentalism, and he criticizes other writers for their treatment of Freud's ideas.\n\nThe book has been praised as brilliant and definitive but has also faced criticism for its lack of thorough scholarship and arguments. Why Freud Was Wrong contributed to the ongoing debate, known as the Freud wars, surrounding the validity of psychoanalysis. \nPeter Swales, born in 1948, is a Welsh historian known for his work on psychoanalysis. He used to help the Rolling Stones and has written about Sigmund Freud. In 1998, The New Republic magazine praised his work over 25 years, where he found out the real names of some early Freud patients who were known by fake names. He's mentioned in a book called In The Freud Archives along with two other men, Kurt R. Eissler and Jeffrey Masson, whose actions are discussed in the book. This book originated from articles in The New Yorker magazine that led to a legal issue for Masson. \nErnest Jones wrote a biography about Sigmund Freud called The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud. It was very famous and popular, first published in three parts from 1953 to 1957. Then, in 1961, a shorter version with help from literary critics Lionel Trilling and Steven Marcus came out. When it first came out, people loved it and it sold well. However, some people now think the biography is not completely honest and shows Freud in a too positive light."}], "output": "\nOedipus Rex.**"},

United States, a court case from 1878, the Supreme Court decided that someone cannot say they were doing something because of their religious beliefs as a reason to not be punished by the law. This case was important because it was the first time the court talked about two parts of the Sixth Amendment, which are about having a fair jury and being able to face your accuser in court. \nMorrison Waite, who was Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from 1874 to 1888, had a busy time with criminal cases.

These butterflies used to be part of a group called Pieridae. There's a simple way to tell them apart: Sinopieris have a grey or black band near the wing's top, while Pieridae butterflies usually have one or two black spots, and no band, on their forewings, and no spots on the hindwings. \nThe andromeda lace bug, a pest for Pieris plants, especially the Japanese andromeda (Pieris japonica), originally came from Japan. It has spread to other parts of the world. Luckily, Pieris floribunda, another species, is immune to this bug. \nLeptosporangiate ferns are a big group of ferns with about 11,000 species found all over the world. They belong to a group called Polypodiidae, but some people think they are part of a bigger group called Pteridopsida or Polypodiopsida. These ferns are one of the four main types, along with others like marattioid ferns, horsetails, and whisk ferns and moonworts. \nPieris floribunda is a type of green, evergreen shrub from North America. It's part of the fetterbush group and is called mountain fetterbush or mountain andromeda. But, be careful - all its parts can be harmful if you eat them. It's not easy to grow in gardens, so it's rare. Some nurseries that specialize in native plants do have it for sale, even though it's hard to grow. If you have it in your yard, plant it in partial shade, away from strong winds, and use soil that's acid with pH 4.5 to 6.5. \nPieris, also known as garden whites, is a type of butterfly in the Pieridae family that can be found almost anywhere. They have the most species in the Palearctic region. These butterflies have caterpillars that mainly eat plants from the Brassicaceae family, like cabbage. For over 100 years, scientists have studied why they like these plants. They discovered that the butterflies have special ways to handle the chemicals called glucosinolates found in Brassicaceae. These caterpillars can't eat anything without glucosinolates, and the female butterflies choose plants with these chemicals before laying eggs.\n\nSome Pieris species can be pests because they have spread to many parts of the world, including South America and Africa, and cause damage to crops. However, there are also non-pest species like Pieris oleracea and Pieris virginiensis in North America that only feed on native plants. \nThe Indian cabbage white, also known as Pieris canidia, is a butterfly in the Pieridae family. Pieris rapae is very similar and is also a member of the same family. \n\nExplanation: \n1. Simplified the first sentence to directly state the butterfly's name and family.\n2. Mentioned Pieris rapae as a close species instead of one of the closest, making it easier to understand without using technical terms. \nGolden polypody, also known as golden serpent fern, cabbage palm fern, gold-foot fern, or hare-foot fern, is a type of plant that grows on other plants. It is found in warm places like the Americas, especially in the eastern part of the continents. It can be found in the United States, from Florida to the southern part of Georgia, and in the Caribbean, including countries like the Bahamas, Puerto Rico, and Lesser Antilles, as well as in parts of South America like Paraguay. This is the only species of Phlebodium in North America, while the others are found in South America. People in different languages call it by names like calaguala in Spanish, laua`e haole in Hawaiian, samambaia in Portuguese, and hartassbräken in Swedish. \nTree ferns are a type of fern that have a trunk that raises their fronds above the ground. They are mainly found in the core tree fern families, like Dicksoniaceae, Metaxyaceae, and Cibotiaceae, which are part of the Cyatheales order. However, some ferns from other groups can also be considered tree ferns if they have short trunks, like the Osmundaceae family or the Cibotium genus, which can grow up to 10 meters tall. Ferns with short trunks in genera like Blechnum, Calochleana, Cnemedaria, Culcita, Lophosoria, Sadleria, Thyrsopteris, Todea, and even in the broader interpretation of Cystodium and Leptopteris, can also be classified as tree ferns."}], "output": "\nNo, Phlebodium and Pieris are not both species of ferns.

It was made in 1897 and 1898 by a company called Parker, and it cost around $12,000. The engineer for the bridge was J.R. Sheely. In 1983, a new bridge was built, and the old one was almost taken down, but it became special and was put on a list of historic places in 1998. Sadly, in 2008, during big floods, the bridge was damaged and one part was gone.修复这个桥需要170万美元, and both FEMA (a government group) and local leaders同意帮忙. A company from Iowa fixed the bridge, and in 2012, they had a big event to celebrate its reopening. \nThe Gardnerville Branch Jail is a special old jail in Gardnerville, Nevada. It was built in 1910 and was the only jail for Douglas County from 1910 to 1915. Before that, the jail was in a place called Genoa, which was the main town. But Gardnerville was far from Genoa, so they kept prisoners in a judge's grain storage building. The people in Gardnerville wanted a better jail, so they asked the county. But some people in Minden, who wanted to be the county's new main town, didn't like it. But the county still said yes and built the new jail. The jail was even used before it was fully finished because the old jail in Genoa caught fire. One person had to wait and be tied to a post until the new jail was ready. After it was done, the jail served the county until Minden became the main jail in 1915. \nThe Cerro Gordo County Courthouse is in Mason City, Iowa. It was chosen as the county's main place in 1855 when Cerro Gordo County was made. Some people in the western part of the county were unhappy and asked the government to move the county seat to Livonia. They built a courthouse there. However, most people in Mason City wanted it back, and in 1858, they voted to keep it as the county seat. Mason City had two courthouses before the modern one that the county started using in 1960. This building used to be a Standard Oil Building and cost $159,400 to buy and change for the county's use. \nThe Old Allamakee County Courthouse, which was once a courthouse in Lansing, Iowa, was built in 1861. There was a disagreement between Lansing and Waukon about which town should be the county's main office. Lansing won a vote in 1861 by joining forces with Columbus. However, Waukon built its own courthouse but didn't win again in 1864. In 1866, the sheriff from Waukon tried to take the county records from Lansing but was stopped. The Iowa Supreme Court finally decided in 1867 that Waukon would be the county seat, and it has stayed there ever since. \nThe Henry Covered Bridge, located near Bartlett, Ohio, is a special old bridge. It's like a roofed walkway and can be found off a road called OH550, not too far away, near a place called Washington County. This bridge is a unique type called a Multiple Kingpost truss and is 45 feet long. It was built in 1894, which means it's very old. \nThe Shinn Covered Bridge is a special old bridge in Ohio, near a place called Bartlett. It's in a field near the woods, and was built in 1886 by a carpenter named Charles Shinn. The bridge is made of wood, has a roof made of metal, and has straight sides. It's unique because it uses a special design called the Burr Truss, which combines a king post truss and an arch from a very old Italian architect. Charles built the bridge to go over Wolf Creek. It's 98 feet long and was built not long after his child passed away. \nThe Eisenhower Bridge is a bridge in Milton, Iowa, that goes over the Fox River for 197 feet. In 1887, people from Des Moines and Lee counties decided to build a new bridge for the Burlington-Fort Madison Road, but they couldn't raise enough money. So, Des Moines would pay three-fifths of the cost, and Lee County would pay the rest. A bridge called the Walker's Ferry Bridge was built by a company from Keokuk, Iowa, and designed by a famous engineer named Horace B. Horton. It originally had two spans but was replaced in 1930. The current bridge, also called the Eisenhower Bridge, was built in 1930 to replace an old one that was destroyed in a flood. It's special because it's one of the few iron truss bridges left in Iowa and was designed by a well-known engineer. In 1998, it was added to a list of historic places in the country. \nThe Main Street Bridge in Charles City, Iowa, is a special old bridge. It was built to help people cross the Cedar River, which is a river, without using a ferry, a ford (a place to cross during dry seasons), or ice. In 1858, the first bridge here was not strong enough and was washed away while being built. After that, a new one was made in 1864, but it too got damaged in a flood in 1866. A temporary bridge was put up and then replaced with a stronger one in 1870, but even that was not good enough. In 1908, they decided to build a new one. A company from Wisconsin designed a new bridge with three parts and it was finished in 1910. It cost about $40,000, and both the county and the city paid for it.

Farrell or Louis Aragon, wrote of the political and human consequences of his country's colonial rule? \n\n Passage: \nThe Murree Rebellion in 1857 was a small part of a bigger event called the Indian Rebellion. It happened when some people living near a hill station called Murree in Pakistan didn't like being ruled by the British in India. They had been unhappy with the British for a long time and had had small fights before. In 1857, these fights felt like they might be part of a bigger plan to end British rule completely. \nThe constitution of Niger, from 1999, promises to protect many human rights as listed in a big rule book called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, some people and groups from both inside and outside the country are worried about how the government, military, and police are treating people. They also mention that some old traditions, which don't match the constitution, are still practiced. Before 1999, when Niger was ruled by France, people didn't have many rights and the government could do whatever it wanted. Even though things have gotten better since then, there are still complaints about human rights in the country. \nIn 1985, Hong Kong changed the way they chose their representatives in the government during the time when Britain was still in control. Before this, they had never done indirect elections like this before. The plan to change was announced in a paper called The Further Development of Representative Government in Hong Kong in July 1984. This happened right before a big agreement called the Sino-British Joint Declaration in December. This change started a new system of democracy in Hong Kong and continued to grow until Hong Kong was given back to China in 1997. \nLes Chansons d'Aragon is a music album by Léo Ferré, made in 1961 by Barclay Records. It's the second album he made where he sings about a poet, inspired by Louis Aragon. Even though Aragon was a surrealist, the songs in this album are not based on surrealistic poetry, but on a collection called Le Roman inachevé. \nThe Sri Lankan Civil War started because of long-standing disagreements between the main group, Sinhalese, and a smaller group, Tamils. Before European rule, the island was controlled by three different kingdoms. During the time of the Portuguese and Dutch, these kingdoms were each governed separately. When the British took over, they combined the whole island into one big government. After gaining independence, the minority Tamils were left in a difficult situation because they were part of a group that had been fighting with the majority before the Europeans came. A person named Jonathan Spencer, from a university in Edinburgh, believes that the war is a result of how the country's different ethnic groups have formed their identities since colonial times. The conflict includes arguments over history and where things came from, as well as the government's actions towards the Tamil minority. \nFort Diu is a place on the west coast of India in a place called Diu, which is a part of the country managed by the Indian government. The fort was made by the Portuguese when they controlled the island. There is a town called Diu near the fort. The fort was built in 1535 because two groups, Bahadur Shah and the Portuguese, made an agreement to protect each other. The fort got stronger over time. The Portuguese ruled for 424 years, from 1537 until 1961. But in 1961, the Indian government asked them to leave because of a military action called Operation Vijay. After that, Diu became a part of India and is now a special area under the central government's control. \nLa Mise en garde Rouge is a song in Léo Ferré's album Les Chansons d'Aragon from 1961. The song's words are inspired by a poem called Strophes pour se souvenir written by Louis Aragon in 1955. This poem was created for a street inauguration in Paris, named rue du Groupe Manouchian, in memory of 23 people who were executed by the Nazis during World War II. The event is known as Affiche rouge because the Germans used red posters to condemn these people as immigrants and Resistance fighters, which were widely displayed in Paris in 1944. \nKing Mwambutsa IV Bangiricenge, who ruled Burundi from 1915 to 1966, was born in 1912 and became king after his father died in 1908. During his time, Burundi was under German rule but became part of Belgian control when he took over in 1916. The Belgians, who controlled both Rwanda and Burundi, kept the kings in place through a system called indirect rule."}], "output": "\nJ. G.

They were designed to catch animals, like wild gazelles, using long, dry stone walls that come together to form a funnel-like space with a neck. These walls can be very big, stretching up to several hundred meters, and can be seen best from above. The name desert kites came from pilots who first spotted them in the 1920s.\n\nThere are about 2,000 of these structures identified in Jordan and Syria, but not much is known about them in Saudi Arabia. Researchers have found that they were mainly used to hunt a specific type of gazelle that disappeared in the Southern Levant in the 19th century. The kites are estimated to be around 3,000 to 5,000 years old, with older dates being disproven by more recent studies. The younger age suggests that these hunts took place after people started farming, not during prehistoric times.\n\nSome rock art near the kites suggests that these hunts might have been big community events, involving people from multiple settlements and possibly having religious significance. \nThe 2000 Race of a Thousand Years was a long race in the American Le Mans Series, held on December 31, 2000, at the Adelaide Street Circuit in Australia.

There's a visitor center where you can see cool old things like plant and sea animal fossils, petrified wood, and dinosaur bones that are 150 million years old! You can walk on a trail called the Petrified Forest Trail, which is a little over a mile long. It goes up a hill and shows lots of big, colorful logs that were turned into stone by a river a long time ago. These logs were once trees and are now like special rocks called agate. There's even a really big, complete fossil log on display nearby. \nFor over a thousand years, beer has been brewed in Hungary, but now, most beer is produced on a large scale. The country has a long tradition of making commercial beer. \nRainbow Girl, whose real name is Dori Aandraison from Xolnar, is a made-up superhero in DC Comics. She first showed up in a comic book called Adventure Comics #309 in 1963, but she didn't join the Legion of Super-Heroes because she wasn't accepted.

Then, in 2002, she appeared again as a teenager in Action Comics #862, as a part of a group called the Legion of Substitute Heroes, which is a team of heroes from the future. \nThe Quaternary is the latest period in the Cenozoic Era, which started after the Neogene. It lasts until now. It's made up of two parts: the Pleistocene, which was from 2.588 million years ago to 11,700 years ago, and the Holocene, which began around 11,700 years ago and is still going on.

T. Petty and Outlast have in common? \n\n Passage: \nThe imprest system is a way to keep track of money in a business. It's like a small piggy bank called the petty cash system. In this system, a set amount is always saved, and when it's all used up, we get more by taking money from a different account, like taking cash from the bank to fill it back up. \nExplanation: Brian Bethell created a character named W. Morgan Petty. W. Morgan Petty would write letters to different places in the 1980s, talking about normal worries for Britain at that time, like nuclear danger and the Common Market. Some of these letters are collected together. \n\nRevised Paragraph: Brian Bethell made up a character named W. Morgan Petty. W Morgan would write letters to different places, sharing common worries people had in Britain during the 1980s, like being afraid of nuclear war and talking about the Common Market. These letters are gathered together in collections. \nUterine cancer, also known as womb cancer, is any cancer that starts in the uterus. The most common type, found worldwide and in developing countries, is cervical cancer, which comes from the bottom part of the uterus. Endometrial cancer, affecting the inside lining, is the second most common and the fourth in developed countries.\n\nRisk factors for uterine cancer include being overweight, getting older, and having an infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). At first, there might not be any symptoms, but later, some might experience changes like abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or feeling full.\n\nIf caught early, most uterine cancers can be treated with surgery or medical methods. If the cancer has spread, more advanced treatments like a combination of chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery might be needed. \nPetty treason was a minor offense where someone under a leader, like an employee, secretly harmed or betrayed their boss. It was different from high treason, which only happened when someone tried to harm the King or Queen. In England and Wales, in 1828, petty treason and murder became the same kind of crime. In Ireland, this was stopped in 1829, and it never happened in Scotland. In other countries that used common law, petty treason was also removed as a separate offense. In simple words, a petit jury is a group of people who listen to both the person saying they're hurt (the plaintiff) and the person they're accusing (the defendant) in a court case. After hearing everything, they discuss and try to decide if the defendant is guilty or not. The rules for deciding are different in some places - some need everyone to agree, while others need a majority. If they can't agree, they're called a hung jury. The number of people on the jury can be 12 in criminal cases in most places, but in Scotland, it's 15.

This was to describe a new kind of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software. Most ERP software simply helps with data entry and processing. But Lim changed this by adding workflow features to the core of his WRP software, which he called Radix ERP. Workflow, where tasks are organized and managed, was already known, but it was mainly used in a program called Lotus Notes before it became less popular in 2000. Mr. Lim took the concept from Lotus Notes and combined it with ERP systems to create Radix WRP, a new type of ERP that makes workflow management easier. \nExplanation: An NTFS symbolic link, or symlink, is like a special kind of file that points to another file or folder in the NTFS file system. When you see a symlink, it looks like a normal file or directory, but it actually leads to the target file or folder. NTFS introduced these links starting with version 3.0 in Windows 2000, especially for directories and volumes. From version 3.1, you can create symlinks for any file type. However, at first, this feature was not available in regular programs. Some third-party drivers, like Masatoshi Kimura's, made it work in user mode. Windows Vista made it possible for user mode applications to use this feature right out of the box. \nJens Ritter Instruments is a company that makes special electric guitars and basses. It was started by a man named Jens Ritter in the 1990s. He only made basses at first, but in 2010, he started making guitars too. He makes around 50 to 60 instruments every year in a small town called Deidesheim, Germany. Some famous bass players, like Phil Lesh, Josh Dunham, and Doug Wimbish, use his instruments. These instruments are unique, fancy, and not many are available. They also sell strings and other stuff to go with them. \nBio-inspired robotic locomotion is a new area in design that takes ideas from nature and applies them to create real-life robots. It's about making robots that look and work like living creatures. Biomimicry, which is copying nature, and bio-inspired design, which learns from nature and makes things simpler and better, are often mixed up. Biomimicry has led to soft robotics, a part of robotics that uses soft materials.\n\nNature's creatures have evolved to do specific tasks in their environment, often being multifunctional. Bio-inspired robotics is about understanding these natural systems and finding ways to use their mechanisms in engineering. Designers study things like eyes (biosensors), muscles (bioactuators), or strong materials (like spider silk) to create better robots.\n\nMany robots have systems to move, so this article will talk about different ways animals move and show some examples of robots inspired by those movements. \nIn US trademark law, the functionality rule stops companies from using trademarks to protect the special parts of a product. There are two parts to this rule: one for practical features that help the product work (utilitarian) and the other for making the product look nice (aesthetic). This rule exists because if new companies could copy these features, it wouldn't make the market fair. Practical features are protected by patent law, not trademarks, because they are useful. Design features that just make the product look good are handled by copyright, which protects artistic creations. \nJackie Winsor, born in St. John's, Newfoundland in 1941, is a sculptor from Canada turned American. Her art style, created in the 1970s, was a reaction against minimal artists. It's known as post-minimal, anti-form, and process art. Her work connects minimalism with feminism, using simple geometric shapes and symmetrical forms, but instead of using industrial materials, she often uses natural, handmade materials like wood and hemp. \nExplanation: Extensibility is a principle in software and system design that plans for future growth. It means a system can be easily expanded, either by adding new features or modifying existing ones, without causing too much trouble. The goal is to make changes without affecting the main parts of the system. An extensible system is one that can be easily modified, like not needing to change the code or source if you want to add new features. This is important because software keeps evolving, so developers can add new functions and reuse parts of it. Some ways to achieve this are by letting users add their own code and creating new data types and formatting tags. \nExplanation: HTML attributes are special features that change how an HTML element works. They either change the basic action of an element or add extra functions to elements that need them. To add an attribute, you put it inside the opening '<>' tag for the element."}], "output": "\nJens Risom introduced a design philosophy characterized by minimalism and functionality, which is known as **bio-inspired robotic locomotion**."},

It has a very wide range of colors, perfect for printing photos. It can show almost all the colors in the world, even the ones we see every day, and it also helps to keep the colors true to their original hue. However, not all the colors it can represent are real colors we can see - about 13% of them are not visible. \nThe YCoCg color model is a way to change an RGB color into three simpler parts: Y for brightness, Cg for green color, and Co for orange color. It's used in things like video and picture compression because it's easy to work with, helps save space, and can be converted losslessly with fewer bits compared to other color systems. It's found in popular formats like H.264 and JPEG XR. \nA color space is like a way to organize colors, both in real and digital pictures. It helps to make sure everyone sees the same color the same way. Some color spaces use special color swatches and names (like Pantone), while others use math (like RGB or CMYK). A color model is a way to represent colors using numbers, but it's not real until we connect it to a specific color space. A color space is created by connecting a color model to a reference color space, like CIELAB or CIEXYZ, which covers all the colors people can see. Adobe RGB and sRGB are two examples of color spaces based on the RGB model. \nHCL combines features of two color systems, HSL and HSV, which are like cylindrical translations of the RGB color space. These systems are easy to understand because they change RGB colors in a way that people find consistent. However, they don't exactly match how we see brightness. There's another system called L*a*b* that's based on how our eyes see colors, but it can be confusing because the blue part isn't as consistent. In noisy situations, a color system that matches how we see better can perform better than RGB. \nRGBA is short for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It's not a separate color space, but rather uses the RGB color model with an extra part called the alpha channel. This alpha value allows for special effects called alpha compositing. The alpha value comes from a Greek letter used in a math formula to mix colors. \nBrown is a color that comes from mixing other colors. In printing or painting, brown is made with red, black, and yellow, or red, yellow, and blue. On TVs and computers, brown is made from red and green. It's often found in nature, like wood, soil, hair, and skin. Brown can be dark wood or soil color. Surveys show that most people don't like brown, associating it with being plain, country-like, dirty, and poor. \nExplanation: The RGB color model lets us make many colors by mixing red, green, and blue light together. It's called that because the words red, green, and blue are the first letters of the three colors used. \nAn RGB color space is a type of color system that uses red, green, and blue light to create colors. It's based on the RGB model and decides what colors it can make by knowing the special colors of red, green, and blue light. To fully understand it, we also need to know the color of white and a way to change the brightness (gamma correction). As of 2007, sRGB is the most often used RGB color space."}], "output": "\nInnocent Records is not mentioned in the passage, so we cannot determine the act associated with it.

He was the brother of King Harold. Tostig was not on good terms with his brother and left to help the Norwegian king, Harald Hardrada, when he came to England. Sadly, Tostig died during a big fight called the Battle of Stamford Bridge. \nEdith the Fair, also known as Edith Swanneck, was the first wife of King Harold Godwinson. She got her name, Swanneck, which sounds like swan neck but was actually misinterpreted as Gentle Swan in Old English. People sometimes mix her with Ealdgyth, who was the queen during Harold's rule and had a different origin. She lived around 1025-1086. \nEasy version: There are stories about Harold Godwinson's short time as king of England that were made up, like a play by Alfred Tennyson in 1876 and a book by Edward Bulwer-Lytton in 1848. Rudyard Kipling also wrote a short story in 1910 where an old King Harold meets Henry I and passes away. \nLast English King is a book written by Julian Rathbone, a British author, in 1997. It's about a man named Walt Edwinson, who was a servant of Harold Godwinson, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England. The story begins with Walt returning to his home in Dorset four years after the big battle at Hastings. He left England after the Anglo-Saxons lost and traveled a lot, visiting places like Europe and Asia Minor. The book also tells his story, including how he traveled from Constantinople to Side and shares his memories of the time before the battle when he helped with William of Normandy's attack on Dinan. \nLeofwine Godwinson was a younger brother of King Harold, who was the fifth child of Earl Godwin. He was born around 1035 and died on October 14, 1066. \nThe Battle of Stamford Bridge happened in a place called Stamford Bridge, in England, on September 25, 1066. It was between two groups: one led by King Harold Godwinson, the English king, and the other led by King Harald Hardrada and his brother Tostig, who were from Norway. Sadly, both Hardrada and Tostig plus many Norwegians lost the battle. Even though Harold won, he lost to the Normans at another big fight (at Hastings) just a few weeks later. People often think this battle marks the end of the Viking Age, but there were more Viking attacks in England and Ireland later, like in 1069-1070 by King Sweyn of Denmark and in 1098-1103 by King Magnus of Norway. \nGytha Thorkelsdóttir, also known as Githa, was a Danish lady from around 1000. She was the mom to Harold Godwinson, who became a king, and Edith, who married King Edward the Confessor of England. \nGodwin of Wessex, whose name was Old English for Godƿin, lived between 1001 and 1053. He was a very important earl in England during the time when the Danish king, Cnut the Great, and his successors were ruling. Cnut appointed him the first Earl of Wessex. Godwin was the father of two famous people: Harold Godwinson, who later became king, and Edith, who married King Edward the Confessor."}], "output": "\nThe English king Harold Godwinson was buried in the county of Kent.**"},

In 2014, Matt Priddis from the West Coast Eagles won the award by getting 26 votes. Gary Ablett, who was expected to win because he had been in the previous year, hurt his shoulder and couldn't play anymore. This made other players, like Joel Selwood, Scott Pendlebury, and Josh Kennedy, think they might win. But in the end, Ablett got the same number of votes as Lance Franklin, who also had 22 votes. \nThe Brownlow Medal is a prize given to the best player in the Australian Football League (AFL) every year since 1927.

Starting in 1978, they would vote together after each game instead. \nIn 2011, the Brownlow Medal, which is given to the best player in the Australian Football League (AFL) during the regular season, was awarded for the 84th time. The winner that year was Dane Swan from Collingwood Football Club. He got the most votes, 34, which was a record at that time. The voting system they used was 3-2-1.

It starts in the Bear Paw Mountains and flows east, then south, before joining the Missouri River about 25 miles northeast of Winifred. The river goes through a canyon in the Missouri Breaks, which are eroded land areas next to the Missouri. The canyon made it easier for people to travel from the north Montana plains to the plains south of the river by foot, especially for buffalo and Native Americans.

The river starts at Brower's Spring, which is close to the Continental Divide and a place where the Missouri River, a big river in the center of the US, starts. \n\nThe Red Rock River goes north and west, and later changes its name to Red Rock Creek. It flows into the Red Rock Lakes, then widens and flows into Lima Reservoir. After that, it goes through a canyon and continues west, picking up more water from places like Peet Creek and Long Creek. Eventually, it empties into Clark Canyon Reservoir.\n\nIn the past, the Red Rock and Horse Prairie Creeks joined here to form the Beaverhead River, which is a smaller river that flows into the Jefferson River, which in turn joins the Missouri River. \nFrenchman's Creek is a small stream, about 4.4 miles long, in San Mateo County, California.

It ranks countries into four groups. A higher HDI means better life because people live longer, learn more, and have more money. It was made by two friends, Amartya Sen from India and Mahbub ul Haq from Pakistan, and the United Nations Development Programme shares it. It's about whether people can be and do good things in their lives. \nChak 86/6 R, also known as Rasool Abad, is a big village in Sahiwal city, Pakistan.

Dr. Fazal Din Sehgal used to be important there. In the 1930s, the village was given to Maher Khar din, who helped families live and work there. It was divided into four parts and became more agricultural. His son, Mehar Amir U Din, continued to develop it. Now, there are different parts like 86 Main Village, Shad-Man Town, and others. In 2002, the village became a union council under General Pervez Musharraf, and Mehar Riaz Ul Haq became the first Nazim, serving three times in Pakistan's history. \nMaulana Sami ul Haq is a religious leader and politician from Pakistan.

It's named after a goddess, Frigg. It started producing gas in 1978 and stopped in 2004. It's 230 kilometers from Stavanger. The field's boss was a French company called Elf Aquitaine, which later joined Total S.A. \nEir is a goddess or helper in Norse mythology, known for her medical skills. She appears in three main sources: the Poetic Edda from the 13th century, the Prose Edda by Snorri Sturluson also from the 13th century, and skaldic poetry from around 1300. Some experts think these might be the same person, and they debate if Eir started as a goddess for healing or a valkyrie (choosing warriors for the afterlife). She has also been connected to Frigg and compared to the Greek goddess Hygieia. \nIn Norse mythology, Sága, a goddess, is known for her wisdom connected to Sökkvabekkr, which might mean a special place with a river or treasure. She and Odin have fun at this place where the water is cool. We learn about them in two big books, the Poetic Edda from the 1300s and the Prose Edda written by Snorri Sturluson in the same time. Some people think Sága might be the same as Frigg, who lived in a place called Fensalir, a fen. \nNanna Nepsdóttir, also known as Nanna, is a goddess in Norse mythology linked to Baldr. Her role is not always clear, as stories differ. In one version from the 13th-century Prose Edda written by Snorri Sturluson, Nanna is Baldr's wife and they had a son named Forseti. When Baldr died, Nanna died of sadness and was placed on his ship with his body, which then caught fire and was sent to sea. In the underworld, they are reunited. To bring Baldr back, Hermóðr visited Hel, where Nanna gave him gifts for Frigg, Fulla, and other gods. Nanna is often mentioned in poems by skalds, and there's a reference to a Nanna in the Poetic Edda, although it's unclear if this is the same figure. \nGná is a Norse goddess who helps Frigg by running tasks in other worlds. She travels on a special horse called Hófvarpnir, which can walk on water. This information is found in a book called the Prose Edda, written in the 1300s. Some people think Gná might be similar to a Roman goddess named Fama. Hófvarpnir and Sleipnir, a magical horse with eight legs, are also important in Norse mythology. \nFensalir, in Norse mythology, is a place where Frigg, the goddess, lives. We know about it from two big books, the Poetic Edda from the 1300s and the Prose Edda also from the 1300s, written by Snorri Sturluson. Some people think Fensalir might be connected to special religious activities in Norse beliefs that were about water, like springs, bogs, or swamps. It could also be related to Sága, a goddess who lived near water, at a place called Sökkvabekkr. \nMarzanna, also known as Morė, Morena, or Mara, is a goddess celebrated in various Slavic and Baltic cultures. She is associated with the changing of seasons, particularly winter's end and the rebirth of nature. The rituals around her often symbolize death and the start of spring. In Slavic traditions, the goddess passes from death during winter to springtime, represented by Kostroma (Russia), Lada, or Vesna. Understanding her, one can see how these celebrations reflect the cycle of life. \nIn simple terms, Fulla is a goddess in Germanic mythology, similar to Volla in Old High German. She wears a golden band and takes care of Frigg's belongings, like shoes. Frigg trusts Fulla with her secrets. Fulla can be found in old stories from the 13th century like the Poetic Edda and Prose Edda. Volla is mentioned in an old German poem from the 10th century, helping to heal a horse. Some people try to understand her meaning."}], "output": "\nThe goddess associated with Frigg, Fensalir, consists of tales related to her residence and her role in Norse mythology. These tales are found in the Poetic Edda and the Prose Edda, both written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century. Fensalir is often linked to religious activities involving water, possibly connected to Sága, another goddess who lived near a place called Sökkvabekkr. Additionally, Frigg is known to have a helper, Gná, who runs tasks in other worlds, and Nanna Nepsdóttir, Baldr's wife, is mentioned in stories about their relationship and her role in bringing Baldr back. Fulla, another goddess, is also associated with Frigg and taking care of her belongings."},

Before that, there was no separate award. Nominations are announced in January, and the ceremony happens later. Only three films are chosen for this award at first, but other awards have more.

Before moving to Pixar, he was part of the team that created the sets for Disney's James and the Giant Peach. \nPaleontologists find it challenging to learn about dinosaur behavior because most research relies on their physical remains. They can use trace fossils and study dinosaur bones to understand some actions, like how they moved and lived together. Some dinosaurs gathered in groups for safety, migration, or protecting their young. Some groups, like crocodiles and birds, which are dinosaurs' close relatives, also showed group behavior. Young dinosaurs were often with their parents, and some had special features that might have been for showing off or mating, but we don't know much about these things.\n\nMost dinosaurs moved on land, and understanding their movement is important for understanding their behavior. Scientists have studied the strength of their muscles and bones to learn how fast they could run and if some dinosaurs could make loud noises like a whip. These studies help us imagine how dinosaurs behaved in their world. \nSanjay's Super Team is a simple movie made by Pixar Animation Studios. It's a short film, created by Sanjay Patel, who told a story from his own childhood. It first showed on June 15, 2015, at a special movie event in France.

It combines fun action figures with an online game. The game lets you collect dinosaur toys (both famous and less known) and collect DNA samples from them. You can analyze the samples on your computer, like in the movie Jurassic Park. If you have DNA from many dinosaurs, you can create a new, super dinosaur to fight against big, bad Megavores - dinosaurs that are like your own. Each dinosaur in the collection has special powers, and when you mix them, you make a super strong toy dinosaur. For example, your first one, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, has the power to bite (Chomp). This makes players want to mix different dinosaur samples to make even stronger creatures. \nEnrico Casarosa is an Italian artist who creates storyboards and directs for Pixar.

They are a big group of Chinese people living outside of Asia, making Australia have more people of Chinese background than any other country outside of the continent. Some come from China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and other places, while others are the descendants of those who moved there. They are part of the Asian and East Asian Australians, and they are the biggest minority group in the whole country. In the 2016 census, about 5.6% of the people said they had Chinese ancestry and there were 1,213,903 of them. \nThe Inter-American Scout Jamboree is the main event for scouts in the Americas. It happens every four years in a different place in the region. The country that hosts it is chosen by a big meeting called the Inter-American Scout Conference. In 2013, at a meeting in Buenos Aires, Argentina, they announced that Ecuador would be the host for the 15th Jamboree. \nSince 1908, when Scouting for Boys came out, Scouts and Girl Guides everywhere have promised to follow the movement's values and agreed to follow a set of rules called the Scout Law. The exact words of the promise or the Scout Law have changed a little over time and depend on where you are. Here's an example of a Scout Promise from some countries. In most groups, they say a promise, but in the Boy Scouts of America, they say an oath. When they say their promise, they usually make a special hand sign with three fingers. \nA small group of people with Arab origins have lived in India for a long time. They are called Indo-Arabs or Indian Arabs because they have Arab ancestry. Most came to Kerala and Gujarat for trade and later joined the army.

Many people with Arab roots, such as Quraish, Ansari, and Sayyid tribes, were hired by the princely states for their military skills.\n\nIn Kerala, Syed Thangals, a group from Hadhrami, settled as missionaries in the 17th century. There are also Shia Sayyids in the north who trace their lineage to Iraq, although some dispute this. Sunni Sayyids, who also claim Arab roots, come from Sufi missionaries or have ancestors like Imam Hassan or Imam Hussain.\n\nSufi saints, like Abdul-Qadir Gilani and Moinuddin Chishti, and their descendants, claim Arab heritage, but this is sometimes questioned by genealogists. Sunni Sheikhs claim Arab descent from Sufis or early Islamic figures, even if they don't know their specific tribe.\n\nSome people with the Ansari name claim ties to the Ansar tribes from Madina. Many Sheikhs who converted from Hindu castes, like Kayasths and Rajputs, also claim Arab ancestry. \nKOKO-FM is a radio station that plays old songs, mainly for people in Fresno.

It was very important, like the Chief model. The Scout, called the 101 Scout, from 1928 to 1931, is thought to be the best Indian ever made. In 1932, they made a lighter and smaller Scout with a smaller engine, along with the Standard Scout that took over from the 101 Scout. They also had the Sport Scout in 1934, but stopped making them in 1942.

Right now, it has laws from the federal government, but they want to add laws from other places too. \nHere's a simpler explanation: \n\nThe main ideas that help things connect are: being close together, repeating, paying attention, feeling happy or sad, and being similar. These ideas were first talked about by two smart people, Aristotle in 300 BC and John Locke in the 1700s.

They created these principles based on the work of Disney animators from the 1930s, who aimed to make their animations more real-like.

Right now, Israel uses a mix of written laws, common rules from the past, and decisions made by the Supreme Court to run the country. But, there are still some things not covered by these Basic Laws and the plan to make everything into one big constitution is not finished yet. Judges help decide which rules are more important in some cases. \nThe Israel constitution is not written down. Instead, it's made up of special rules called Basic Laws that were created by the Israeli government. These laws were chosen because a decision made in 1950 said they should be as important as a constitution. The country's top judge, Aharon Barak, said these laws are the constitution, but some judges, like Mishael Cheshin, disagree with him. \nThe Physics of Superheroes is a book by a physics teacher who loves comics. It came out in 2005 and talks about how real-life physics works. The book doesn't say that superheroes do things that don't make sense, it just shows how some superhero actions can teach us about physics in fun ways, like how Spider-Man can lift heavy things (lever effect) and how Ant-Man can pop out of a small bag (force).

In 2015, Governor Terry McAuliffe chose her to replace Justice LeRoy F. Millette, who retired. Her term was set to end 30 days after the next legislative session, unless she was chosen for a longer term. In July 2015, the General Assembly tried to elect her but failed before officially ending. This caused confusion because the Constitution's rules say a special session can't last more than 3 days without the other chamber's approval. The Governor thinks they didn't meet that requirement, but others disagree. As a result, it's uncertain if the first interim term ended, and if so, if the Governor could appoint her again. The situation is still being debated, and if he did, her second interim term would have ended in February 2016. Calgary, Alberta, Canada, has had different election rules for its mayor and council. Until 1923, mayors were elected for one year at a time. Starting in 1971, both positions were for three-year terms. Before that, councillors were elected annually, but from 1914, terms were two years, with half of the council changing each year. In 1976, there were 14 wards, and each ward had a three-year term. In 2010, the title councillor was changed, and in 2012, the term length for both positions was extended to four years.\n\nThis makes the information easier to understand by breaking it down into simpler steps and timelines. \nJoseph F.

It's part of a bigger group called SLC12 cotransporters. In people, the gene for this helper is found on chromosome 16, labeled as SLC12A3. \nThe loop of Henle, found in the kidney, is a part of a nephron that moves from the top to the bottom part. It's called this because a scientist named Friedrich Henle found it. This loop helps to make the kidney's inside, called the medulla, have different levels of concentration. \nLow pressure receptors, also known as volume receptors, are sensors found in the veins returning blood to the heart (venae cavae), lungs' arteries, and heart's atria. They detect changes in the wall tension, which is related to how full the lower parts of the circulation are (below 60mmHg). These receptors help control the release of hormones like antidiuretic hormone (ADH), renin, and aldosterone.\n\nWhen the atrial pressure rises, the receptors send signals that reduce the production of ADH and aldosterone. This leads to more urine being produced, which in turn lowers blood pressure. On the other hand, when the atria stretch, they stimulate the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which increases the amount of water and sodium being flushed out through the urine, further helping to lower blood pressure. \nRenal tubular acidosis (RTA) is when the body has too much acid because the kidneys can't properly make the urine acidic enough. The kidneys filter blood and remove extra things like salts and acids when it goes through tiny tubes called nephrons. If the kidneys don't keep enough bicarbonate (a base) or make enough hydrogen ions (an acid) in the tubes, it can cause acid buildup. RTA is different from just not having enough kidney function, and there are different types with their own special problems. \nExplanation: The nephron in your kidney has a part called the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. This comes after a bend in the loop, which is after the descending limb. This part of the kidney tubule, which gets bigger, is called both the thick ascending limb and the distal straight tubule, different from the distal convoluted tubule further down. \n\n Simplified: The kidney part that follows the bend in the loop is called the ascending limb. It's a bit thicker and is also called the distal straight tubule, not to be confused with the distal convoluted tubule further along. \nExplanation: The kidney has a system called tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) to control how much water and stuff is filtered out of our blood (glomerular filtration rate, or GFR). Inside each kidney part called a nephron, the tubules, which are further along in the flow, tell the glomerulus, which is at the beginning, what's happening. If the tubules have too much salt, the cells near them release something called adenosine. This starts a chain reaction that adjusts GFR to the right amount. It's all about how the body keeps the right balance. \nSylvia Agnes Sophia Tait, born on January 8, 1917, and passed away on February 28, 2003, was an English scientist who studied biochemistry and endocrinology. She was originally known as Sylvia Wardropper but changed her name to Sylvia Simpson from 1941 to 1956. She worked closely with her second husband, James Francis Tait, from 1948 until their joint death. Their partnership was highly successful, as recognized by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.\n\nTogether, they made a significant discovery - the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone is a type of steroid hormone that was isolated and identified in the 1940s and 1950s, following the discovery of hormones like androgens, oestrogens, and glucocorticoids. This hormone plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure. It helps control the balance of sodium and potassium in the body, affects water retention, and contributes to 15% of high blood pressure cases. \nDistal renal tubular acidosis, also known as Type 1 renal tubular acidosis, is the original form of a condition where the kidneys don't work properly to make acid. This happens in the part of the kidney called the distal nephron, where tiny tubes collect urine. The problem is with the cells in these tubes called alpha intercalated cells, which are responsible for making acid. Because they can't do their job, the urine doesn't become acidic enough (pH below 5.3)."}], "output": "\nThe hormone aldosterone, produced by the alpha intercalated cells in the distal nephron, promotes sodium retention.**"},

They happened on November 8th, and people were voting for two seats in the Senate and eight in the House of Representatives. Also, half of the Senate seats and all Assembly seats were up for grabs. Before the main election, there was a special event called the primary elections, which happened on August 9th. \nMidterm elections in the US are like special elections that happen two years after the big ones for the President. These elections are for people who work in the government, like the people in the House of Representatives (435 seats) and some of the Senators (100 seats, 33 or 34 at a time). These elections happen around the middle of a four-year President's term. \nIn the United States, there are three types of Senators, each with 33 or 34 seats. The main goal is to decide which seats need to be chosen every two years, instead of all 100 at once. This is done by dividing them into three groups - Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3. In 2012, Class 1 seats were elected, in 2014, Class 2 seats, and in 2016, Class 3 seats were up for grabs. \nTeam Unity was a political group that worked together for the 2007 elections in the Philippines. It had members who were once against the previous president, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, and her allies. Their goal was to help her by getting more Senate seats and stop any plans to impeach her, since she was part of the administration. \nThe 80th United States Congress was a group of lawmakers from the US government, made up of the Senate and House of Representatives. They met in Washington D.C. from 1947 to 1949, during President Harry Truman's third and fourth years in office. This Congress had its members based on the 1940 US Census. The Republicans, who won more seats, became the majority in both chambers.\n\nEven though the Congress passed 906 laws, President Truman called it the Do Nothing Congress because he didn't agree with their actions. During the election in 1948, Truman criticized them. Some important business laws, like the Taft-Hartley Act, were passed, but the Congress didn't support most of Truman's plans to help people, called the Fair Deal. As a result, the Democrats won back more seats in the next Congress. \nThe US elections in 2002 happened on November 5 during President George W. Bush's first term. Something rare happened - even though it's usually the other way around, the president's party, the Republicans, did better than expected. They got more seats in both the Senate and the House, with 2 extra Senate seats and 8 in the House. \nIn简单易懂的话：There were elections for 35 spots in the US Senate on November 4, 2008. 33 usual seats were up for grabs, and the winners could serve for 6 years until 2015. Two special elections were for shorter terms, one in Mississippi and one in Wyoming. The winners of these would fill the remaining time until 2013. \nIn the 2002 United States Senate elections, both parties fought hard. The Republicans won and got two more seats, making them slightly closer to the Democrats in the Senate. These elections were for seats that last had elections in 1996. They took place on November 5, 2002, not long after a big event called September 11, 2001, happened."}], "output": "\n33 Senate seats will be contested during the midterm elections that Nancy Soderberg has filed to run for Congress in.**"},

Thompkins and Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan which one was a  case decided 5-4 by the Supreme Court of the United States? \n\n Passage: \nThe Hoffman v. Jones case, decided by the Supreme Court of Florida in 1973, was the first time a court in the US applied the idea of comparative negligence in accidents, not just by law but through a judicial decision. It was a very important case because it changed the rule that if someone was hurt in an accident, they couldn't get compensation if they also contributed to the problem, a rule called contributory negligence which was very old, almost 150 years. Instead, the court said people could still get some compensation for the part of the harm caused by the person who was at fault, even if they were partly to blame. This new concept, pure comparative negligence, has been widely used in legal decisions since then. \nVan Staphorst vs. Maryland, a court case from 1791 in the United States Supreme Court, was the very first one to be officially recorded. Even though the court planned to hear and decide it, the dispute was resolved before the lawyers could speak. Collet vs. Collet was the first case the court heard at the appellate level. West v. Barnes was the first case the court actually ruled on. \nThe Whole Woman's Health case, decided by the US Supreme Court on June 27, 2016, said that Texas cannot put too many rules on abortion clinics, making it hard for women to get one. On June 28, the court didn't listen to challenges from Wisconsin and Mississippi, where similar rules were not allowed. This might affect other states with similar rules too. \nIn the Hirabayashi v. United States case in 1943, the US Supreme Court said that curfews for minority groups, like Japanese Americans during World War II, were okay because the country was fighting a war with their home country. This happened after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the US joined the war. The government, under President Franklin Roosevelt, allowed leaders to keep certain areas safe, and Japanese Americans were affected by this, including a curfew. A man named Gordon Hirabayashi got in trouble for breaking the curfew and took it to the Supreme Court. Another case, Yasui v. United States, was decided the same day and both cases were later corrected in the 1980s. \nIn a case called Commissioner v. Banks in 2005, the Supreme Court in the US decided if money a person gets from a court or settlement, which they paid to their lawyer as a part of a special fee agreement, should be taxed as income. The court said yes, this money is income. But, for situations where someone gets money because of a job discrimination case, there's a change. The Civil Rights Tax Relief law from 2004 lets people subtract the lawyer's fees from their income taxes. \nIn the case of Summers v. Earth Island Institute in 2009, the Supreme Court, with a 5-4 vote, decided that some groups fighting for the environment could sue the US Forest Service. They were trying to stop the Forest Service from selling 238 acres of burned land for timber without following the normal steps required by a law called the Forest Service Decision-making and Appeals Reform Act, which usually includes giving people a chance to give their opinions. \nIn the United States v. Quiver case, decided by the Supreme Court in 1916, a man and a woman from the Oglala Sioux Tribe, both enrolled members, were accused of having an affair on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. The court heard the case on February 28, 1916 and gave its decision on June 12. The district court initially said that the act from 1887, which punished adultery, didn't apply because the reservation was not under the district court's jurisdiction.\n\nThe Supreme Court agreed with the district court, saying that since both individuals were American Indians on an American Indian reservation, the adultery was not punishable under federal law. \nV.L. and E.L., a same-sex couple, had three children together. In 2007, a Georgia court gave V.L. the right to adopt the kids after E.L., who gave birth, moved to Alabama. However, when they divorced, E.L. tried to stop V.L. from seeing the children. V.L. then took legal action for visitation and rights. In Alabama, in 2015, the Supreme Court said the Georgia court's decision was wrong and canceled the adoption recognition. V.L. asked the bigger court in the US to stop the Alabama decision while she appealed. On December 14, 2015, the big court agreed to wait. On March 7, 2016, the Supreme Court of the United States said the Alabama court was wrong and made a quick decision without a full hearing."}], "output": "\nSummers v. Earth Island Institute.**"},

It came after his first album, Whenever You Need Somebody. The album was made by a mix of people: half was created by Stock Aitken & Waterman, who are known for pop music, and the other half was made by other musicians at PWL Studios. Unfortunately, a fire at PWL Studios caused a delay in the album's release because some of Astley's songs were lost. This was the last album Astley made with Stock, Aitken & Waterman because he wanted to change his style, leave behind the dance-pop sound, and focus on writing his own songs. He later released a soul album, Free, in 1991. Boy Next Door is Jamelia's fifth song, from her first album Drama. It didn't reach the top 40 in the UK, only reaching #42 and staying for two weeks in the Top 75. The single version is a little different from the one on the album, being slightly shorter. \nNot the Boy Next Door is a music album made by Peter Allen, an Australian singer and songwriter, in 1983.

In Western stories, he is often the typical guy your neighbor might be. He can be the love interest for a girl who lives close by. \nStacey Kent, an American jazz singer, recorded a version of it for her album The Boy Next Door in 2003. This song has been performed by other musicians too, including Stan Getz, Bruce Eskovitz, Carmen McRae, Lee Konitz, Spike Robinson, Eddie Higgins, and Bennie Wallace. \nSuperstar - The Hits is a collection of Jamelia's popular songs, a British R&B singer's best work. It came out on September 24, 2007, from Parlophone Records. This album has ten of her songs that were very popular in the UK, but it doesn't include her first song, So High, I Do, Boy Next Door, and Universal Prayer (which still hasn't been released here). But don't worry, it does have her version of Stop that you can find on this album for the first time. \nFire! is a manga series about a rock star named Aaron. It was created by Hideko Mizuno and was shown in Seventeen magazine from 1969 to 1971. It won a prize in 1970. Aaron, the main character, is not a typical nice guy or a perfect hero. People liked him because he was different and rebellious. The story was special because it had the first detailed romantic scenes for girls in manga after World War II, and it had a boy as the main character. Some people think it teaches a conservative lesson, but others say readers really enjoyed following Aaron's story, even waiting in line for new issues. \nBoy Meets Girl is a book from 2004 written by an American lady named Meg Cabot. It was first published in January that year using her real name, Meggin Cabot, by a company called HarperCollins. When the book was republished, she used the pen name Meg Cabot.

She married Philip Sidney, who later became the 1st Baron De L'Isle and Dudley, and they had four kids who survived. Sadly, she passed away in 1837. Before her death, she held a position as the State Housekeeper in Kensington Palace. \nExplanation: The Regency Act from 1830, made by the UK Parliament, was made to plan for a situation where the King, William IV, would pass away and there was no one else to be the next king yet, who was 18 or younger. It said someone would be in charge (a regent) until the new king turned 18. Also, it allowed for the king's child born after him to become the king if he didn't have any. But, this act never worked because William IV didn't have any real children, and Victoria became queen when she was 18 in 1837. \n\nRephrased: In 1830, the UK made a law (Regency Act) to handle the case where King William IV might die and there was no one under 18 to be the next king. It planned for someone to lead until the new king turned 18. Also, it allowed a child of King William to be the king if he didn't have one. But, this plan never happened because William IV didn't have any kids and Victoria became queen right at 18 in 1837. \nWilhelmina FitzClarence, who was also known as Mina, was a British lady and writer. She was born on June 27, 1830, and her mom, Lady Augusta, was a child of King William IV. Mina was born right after her dad became the king. As a young lady, she went on trips to Europe, visiting places like France and Hanover. In 1855, she got married to her cousin, William FitzClarence, who was the 2nd Earl of Munster. They had nine kids, including two who became Earls of Munster."}], "output": "\nDecember 19, 1798.**"}]

Originating in the southern foothills of the Bear Paw Mountains in western Blaine County, Cow Creek flows eastward and then southward before joining the Missouri River about 25 miles northeast of Winifred, Montana. The confluence occurs around 22 miles upstream from the Fred Robinson Bridge. Cow Creek travels through a canyon within the Missouri Breaks, which are heavily eroded badlands extending from both sides of the Missouri River. This canyon historically served as a travel route from the northern Montana plains to the central and southern plains, utilized by migrating buffalo and nomadic Native Americans. During the steamboat era on the Missouri River, the mouth of Cow Creek became a significant river landing and freighting depot when low water levels prevented riverboats from reaching Fort Benton. In 1877, the Nez Perce Indian Tribe engaged in skirmishes along Cow Creek, including the Battle of Cow Island, before eventually slowing down at a camp on Cow Creek, a decision that led to their capture by the U.S. Army. Today, modern highways have bypassed Cow Creek, and the region remains one of the most remote areas within the vast Montana Missouri Breaks."}], "output": "Frenchmans Creek is a tributary of the Missouri River.

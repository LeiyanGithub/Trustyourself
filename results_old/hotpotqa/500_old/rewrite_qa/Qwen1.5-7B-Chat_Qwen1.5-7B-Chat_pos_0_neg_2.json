The First Italo-Ethiopian War, which took place from 1895 to 1896, was a conflict between Italy and Ethiopia that arose from a controversial treaty. Initially, the Italians believed they would gain control over Ethiopia, but they encountered a united front led by Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, who was backed by Russia and other allies, including the UK and France. These nations provided diplomatic support to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial power. Despite initial Italian victories, Ethiopia's counterattack and the decisive defeat at the Battle of Adwa forced the Italian army to retreat, solidifying Ethiopia's autonomy."}], "output": "\nIndependence.**"},

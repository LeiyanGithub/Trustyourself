This mineralocorticoid hormone is released in response to angiotensin, a peptide hormone that raises blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin system. Aldosterone works by acting on mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal tubules and collecting ducts of the nephron, influencing the reabsorption of sodium and excretion of potassium in the kidney. It plays a crucial role in regulating plasma sodium, potassium, and blood pressure. When aldosterone function is dysregulated, it can contribute to cardiovascular and renal disease. The sodium-chloride symporter, encoded by the SLC12A3 gene, is a cotransporter in the kidney responsible for reabsorbing sodium and chloride ions into the distal convoluted tubule, further contributing to blood pressure regulation."}], "output": "\nThe adrenal cortex, specifically the zona glomerulosa, produces aldosterone, the hormone that promotes sodium retention in the distal nephron.**"},

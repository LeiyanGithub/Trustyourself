A set of six Assistant Secretaries reporting to the Under Secretary for Political Affairs manage diplomatic missions within their designated geographic regions, plus one Assistant Secretary dealing with international organizations.  Assistant Secretaries usually manage individual bureaus of the Department of State.  When the manager of a bureau or another agency holds a title other than Assistant Secretary, such as Director, it can be said to be of Assistant Secretary equivalent rank.  Assistant Secretaries typically have a set of deputies, referred to as Deputy Assistant Secretaries (DAS). Douglas Joseph “Doug” Bennet, Jr. (born June 23, 1938) is a former national political official and college president.  He was the fifteenth president of Wesleyan University, in Middletown, Connecticut, from 1995 to 2007.

response:    Here is the rephrased passage with a more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structure:

Asgard, a 51-foot gaff-rigged yacht, gained notoriety for its involvement in the Howth gun-running of 1914. Owned by the renowned writer and Irish nationalist Erskine Childers and his wife Molly, the yacht played a significant role in the Irish struggle for independence. Erskine Childers, a prominent figure in the Irish nationalist movement, was executed by the authorities of the nascent Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War. His son, Erskine Hamilton Childers, went on to become the fourth President of Ireland.

The Childers family was deeply involved in the Irish nationalist cause. Erskine Childers' wife, Molly, was the daughter of Dr. Hamilton Osgood and Margaret Cushing Osgood of Beacon Hill, Boston, Massachusetts. Her sister, Gretchen Osgood Warren, was an actress, singer, and poet. Their nephew, Erskine Hamilton Childers, served as the fourth President of Ireland from 1973-74.

Robert Erskine Childers, a British writer and Fenian revolutionary, smuggled guns to Ireland in his sailing yacht Asgard. He was executed by the authorities of the Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War. His grandfather, Robert Caesar Childers, was a British Orientalist scholar who compiled the first Pāli-English dictionary. Childers' cousin, Hugh Childers, and his double first cousin, Robert Barton, were both involved in the negotiation of Irish independence.

The Irish Bulletin, the official gazette of the government of the Irish Republic, was produced by the Department of Propaganda during the Irish War of Independence. The paper's first editor was Desmond FitzGerald, until his arrest and replacement by Robert Erskine Childers. The Bulletin appeared in weekly editions from 11 November 1919 to 11 July 1921.

Erskine Barton Childers, an Irish writer, BBC correspondent, and United Nations senior civil servant, was the eldest son of Erskine Hamilton Childers and Ruth Ellen Dow Childers. His grandparents, Mary Alden Childers and Robert Erskine Childers, and his great aunt, Gretchen Osgood Warren, were all involved in the Irish nationalist movement. His cousin, Robert Childers Barton, participated in the negotiations leading up to the signature of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

response:    Here is the rephrased paragraph:

The song "Hip Hip Pooh-Ray!" from the 1968 musical film featurette Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day is a lighthearted tune that celebrates the friendship between Pooh and Piglet. The song is also included in the 1977 musical film The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, which combines three Winnie-the-Pooh featurettes. The Sherman Brothers wrote the song, and it is performed by an unidentified off-screen chorus with occasional lines sung by Sterling Holloway, who provided the voice of Pooh. The song is a release from the dramatic tension of the story and highlights the positive relationship between the two characters.

Additionally, here are the rephrased versions of the other songs mentioned in the passage:

* "Heffalumps and Woozles" is a whimsical song from the 1968 Walt Disney musical film featurette Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day. The song is written by the Sherman Brothers and performed by The Mellomen. It is also included in the 1977 full-length feature film The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.
* "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" is the theme song and personal anthem of Tigger, a fictional tiger from the Winnie-the-Pooh series. The song is written by the Sherman Brothers and is repeated in several Disney productions, including Winnie the Pooh and Tigger Too! and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.
* "The Rain Rain Rain Came Down Down Down" is a narrative song from the Walt Disney musical film featurette Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day. The song is also incorporated into the 1977 musical film The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.
* "A Rather Blustery Day" is a whimsical song from the Walt Disney musical film featurette Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day. The song is written by Robert & Richard Sherman and sung by Jim Cummings as Pooh.
* "Little Black Rain Cloud" is a song from the 1966 musical film featurette Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree. An instrumental version is played in the next featurette Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, and it is subsequently incorporated into the 1977 musical film The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.

Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote.  Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with.  For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions. In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance.  For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance.  A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls.  In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level. The Apple Remote is a remote control device released in or after October 2005 by Apple Inc. for use with a number of its products which use infrared capabilities.  The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers.  The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism.  It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation.  Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive. The Siri Remote is a remote control device released in tandem with the 4th Generation Apple TV at an Apple Keynote Address by CEO Tim Cook on October 26, 2015 by Apple Inc. The Remote is designed specifically to work with the always-on Siri capable Apple TV.  The device is a successor of the original Apple Remote.  It is also compatible with the Apple TV 4K. NetSupport Manager is a Windows-centric cross-platform remote control software, allowing remote screen control and systems management from a Windows or Windows Mobile device of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris and Mobile devices.  It was first released for DOS only networks in 1989.  It supports thumbnail display of unlimited remote systems (since version 10), and allows navigation between remote systems in a manner similar to a KVM switch.  Functionality includes file transfers, chat, and hardware/software inventory including software updates. Fewer features are supported for Linux and Mac clients.  In 2012 NetSupport introduced new software versions allowing Remote Control from iOS and Android tablets and smartphones as well as a new Mac OS Control.  Version 12 was released in October 2013, which extended platform support to include ChromeOS clients.  Mobile Remote Control from iOS and Android was also extended with additional capabilities.  All versions of NetSupport Manager require the pre-installation of the software on both the local (Control) and remote (Client) computers/devices prior to use. Front Row is a discontinued media center software application for Apple's Macintosh computers and Apple TV for navigating and viewing video, photos, podcasts, and music from a computer, optical disc, or the Internet through a 10-foot user interface (similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi).  The software relies on iTunes and iPhoto and is controlled by an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys.  The first version was released October 2005, with two major revisions since.  Front Row was removed and discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7. Apple Watch (stylized as WATCH) is a line of smartwatches developed, designed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services.  The original generation of the device was available in four variants: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Hermès, and Apple Watch Edition; each distinguished by different combinations of cases and first- or third-party interchangeable bands.  Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting.  It is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  Announced by Apple CEO Tim Cook in September 2014, the device was released in April 24, 2015.  The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the supply of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year.  The second generation of Apple Watch, released in September 2016, includes two tiers: Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Series 1, which includes the S1P chip, but is otherwise identical to the original.  The Series 3 was announced at a presentation at Apple Park on September 12, 2017 and was released on September 22, 2017. MacScan is an anti-malware utility for Apple's Mac OS X developed by SecureMac.  It is aimed at removing malware (including spyware, Trojan horses, keystroke loggers, and tracking cookies).  It was the first anti-spyware program released for Mac OS X.  In addition, the application scans for remote administration programs, like Apple Remote Desktop, allowing users to verify that such programs are installed only with their authorization. Trainmaster Command (TMCC) is Lionel's electronic control system for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains that mainly ran from 1994 to 2006.  Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry's open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains.  It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives and Lionel Legacy engines as well as LionChief and LionChief Plus equipped locomotives.  The latter require a dedicated remote controller.  MTH Corporation's DCS controller can be configured to control TMCC locomotives, and all four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief/LionChief+ and DCS) can be operated on the same track simultaneously.  Each simply requires a constant track voltage (18 volts).  TMCC/Legacy broadcasts it's signal to the antenna on the locomotives which listen for signals that first identify the particular locomotive by number and then it issues given commands as to speed, direction, sounds, lighting and other features.  DCS performs similar functions but transmits a carrier over the rails which are picked up through the locomotive's electrical pickup contacts.  While TMCC/Legacy and DCS remote controls relay operator commands to a device that transmits them to the train (Command Base or Track Interface Unit), LionChief/LionChief+ also issue remote control commands but the remote and locomotive are married and each locomotive requires a separate remote control.  This system requires no additional wiring as the control is directly narrowcast to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener functions.  In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that will learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, simplifying the operation of multiple trains. Apple Remote Desktop (ARD) is a Macintosh application produced by Apple Inc., first released on March 14, 2002, that replaced a similar product called Apple Network Assistant.  Aimed at computer administrators responsible for large numbers of computers and teachers who need to assist individuals or perform group demonstrations, Apple Remote Desktop allows users to remotely control or monitor other computers over a network.

Dictyosperma is a unique genus of flowering plants that belongs to the palm family and is found only in the Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean (Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues). The sole species, Dictyosperma album, is widely cultivated in the tropics but has been over-harvested in its native habitat. It is commonly known as the princess palm or hurricane palm due to its ability to shed leaves in strong winds. This genus is closely related to the Archontophoenix genus and is named after the Greek words for "net" and "seed." The epithet "album" is Latin for "white," which describes the color of the crownshaft at the top of the trunk.

Huernia is a genus of stem succulents that is found in Eastern and Southern Africa. It was first described as a genus in 1810 and consists of species with five-lobed flowers that are often striped in contrasting colors. These flowers attract flies by emitting a scent similar to that of carrion, which is used for pollination. The genus is closely related to the genera Stapelia and Hoodia, and the name is in honor of Justin Heurnius, a Dutch missionary who is believed to have been the first collector of South African Cape plants. However, his name was mis-spelled by the collector.

St. Andre is a constituency in the state of Goa, India, and is home to the historic St. Andre Church, which was built in 1860 to serve the local French-Canadian and French-American communities. The church is now a part of the Good Shepherd Parish, which was formed in 2008 by merging several other churches in the area. The parish complex, including the church, rectory, convent, and school, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

In addition to its historical significance, St. Andre is also known for its natural beauty, with the Crank Caverns and surrounding woods offering a unique and accessible adventure for curious locals and visitors. The caverns, which were once used as a game reserve and later as a storage facility, are now closed to the public due to their instability, but the site remains a popular draw for those looking to explore the area's history and myths.

In the world of fantasy role-playing games, St. Andre is also the name of a popular game designed by Ken St. Andre and published by Flying Buffalo. Tunnels & Trolls, as it is known, was first released in 1975 and has since become a classic of the genre. The game has inspired numerous adventures and adaptations, including the computer game Crusaders of Khazan, which was developed and published by New World Computing in 1990.

The song was released as the second single from their 2000 Crack a Smile...and More!  album.  The single/sampler was released in February 2000 and featured five b-sides including the first single from the album Shut Up, Make Love and the four unplugged bonus tracks from the album: Every Rose Has Its Thorn, Talk Dirty to Me, Your Mama Don't Dance and Something to Believe In. Make Love is a song performed by American recording artist and songwriter Keri Hilson.  It was written by Jamal Polow da Don Jones, Ester Dean and Jason Perry, and produced by Polow da Don and Perry for Hilson's debut studio album, In a Perfect World... (2009).  The song was sent for urban adult contemporary airplay on June 23, 2009 as the fifth single from the album.  Musically, Make Love is a downtempo R&B ballad.  The song received mixed reviews from music critics; some of them criticized its long length and Hilson's vocals, while others named it one of the album's standouts.

The popularity continued into the new decade with their third consecutive multi-platinum selling album, Flesh & Blood. Chuck Berry on Stage is an album by Chuck Berry, released in 1963 by Chess Records.  Although promoted as a live album, it is a collection of previously released studio recordings (except for 5 songs...All Aboard, Trick or Treat, I Just Want To Make Love To You, Still Got The Blues, and a previously unreleased alternate take of Brown-Eyed Handsome Man) with overdubbed audience sounds to simulate a live recording.  One track on the album labelled Surfin' USA, is Sweet Little Sixteen, originally released in 1958, the melody of which was used in The Beach Boys' 1963 hit Surfin' USA.  Chuck's cover of Willie Dixon's I Just Want To Make Love To You was later re-recorded and released on the very rare Chess LP CH60032 Chuck Berry in 1975.

Georges Félix Madon (July 28, 1892 – November 11, 1924) was the fourth ranked French ace pilot of the First World War.  His lengthy career and wide variety of aviation experiences were remarkable. William Earl Johns (5 February 189321 June 1968) was an English pilot and writer of adventure stories, usually written under the pen name Captain W. E. Johns.  He is best remembered as the creator of the ace pilot and adventurer Biggles. Charles Eugène Jules Marie Nungesser, MC (15 March 1892 – presumably on or after 8 May 1927) was a French ace pilot and adventurer, best remembered as a rival of Charles Lindbergh.  Nungesser was a renowned ace in France, ranking third highest in the country with 43 air combat victories during World War I. Gervais Raoul Victor Lufbery (March 14, 1885 – May 19, 1918) was a French and American fighter pilot and flying ace in World War I. Because he served in both the French Air Force, and later the United States Army Air Service in World War I, he is sometimes listed alternately as a French ace or as an American ace.  Officially, all but one of his 17 combat victories came while flying in French units. L'Oiseau bleu (also known as The Blue Bird and Der Blaue Vogel) is a large oil painting created in 1912–1913 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956); considered by Guillaume Apollinaire and André Salmon as a founder of Cubism, along with Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso.  L'Oiseau bleu, one of Metzinger's most recognizable and frequently referenced works, was first exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Indépendants in the spring of 1913 (n. 2087), several months after the publication of the first (and only) Cubist manifesto, Du «Cubisme», written by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes (1912).  It was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 in Berlin (titled Der blaue Vogel, n. 287).  Apollinaire described L'Oiseau bleu as a 'very brilliant painting' and 'his most important work to date'.  L'Oiseau bleu, acquired by the City of Paris in 1937, forms part of the permanent collection at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris. The Levasseur PL.8 was a single engine, two-seat long-distance record-breaking biplane aircraft modified from an existing Levasseur PL.4 carrier-based reconnaissance aircraft produced in France in the 1920s.  Levasseur built the aircraft in 1927, specifically for pilots Charles Nungesser and François Coli for a transatlantic attempt to win the Orteig Prize.  Only two examples of the type were built, with the first PL.8-01 named L'Oiseau Blanc (The White Bird), that gained fame as Nungesser and Coli's aircraft. Sergent Paul Joannes Sauvage was a French World War I flying ace credited with eight confirmed and six unconfirmed aerial victories.  He was originally posted to fly a Nieuport for Escadrille 65, and scored his first victory with them on 16 July 1916.  He became the youngest French ace on 2 October, and held that distinction until his death by anti-aircraft fire on January 7, 1917. Wooster and Davis-- Lieutenant Stanton Hall Wooster (April 1, 1895 Connecticut - April 26, 1927) and Lieutenant Commander Noel Guy Davis (December 25, 1891 Salt Lake City, Utah - April 26, 1927) were two United States Navy (USN) airmen who made an attempt to fly the Atlantic Ocean from New York-to-Paris in the spring of 1927.  The men were trying to win the $25,000 dollar Orteig Prize offered by New York hotelier Raymond Orteig for the first nonstop flight between New York and Paris.  Competitors for the prize were French World War One ace Rene Fonck and his crew of three, USN Commander Richard Evelyn Byrd, Clarence Chamberlain and a young airmail pilot named Charles Lindbergh.  On the Paris side of the Atlantic their competitors were another World War One French ace, Charles Nungesser, and his navigator Francois Coli. L'Oiseau Blanc (commonly known in the English-speaking world as The White Bird ) was a French Levasseur PL.8 biplane that disappeared in 1927, during an attempt to make the first non-stop transatlantic flight between Paris and New York City to compete for the Orteig Prize.  The aircraft was flown by French World War I aviation heroes, Charles Nungesser and François Coli.  The aircraft took off from Paris on 8 May 1927 and was last seen over Ireland.  Less than two weeks later, Charles Lindbergh successfully made the New York–Paris journey and claimed the prize, flying the Spirit of St. Louis. [/INST]

The band's members are Kay Hanley, Greg McKenna, Michael Eisenstein, Stacy Jones, Scott Riebling, and later, Tom Polce. Truly is an American rock band formed in the wake of the grunge era.  It featured singer-guitarist Robert Roth, bassist Hiro Yamamoto, and drummer Mark Pickerel.  Yamamoto and Pickerel were founding members respectively of Soundgarden and Screaming Trees.  While not a commercially successful group like some of their Seattle contemporaries, the band lasted a decade with two studio albums to their name. Change Has Come was the only recording the Screaming Trees released through Sub Pop.  Released in 1990 the Screaming Trees then moved on to a major label, Epic Records, for their next three albums - Uncle Anesthesia, Sweet Oblivion, and Dust, as well as the Something About Today EP. Jamboree is the second album by Beat Happening, released in 1988 through K Records/Rough Trade Records.  All songs were produced by Steve Fisk with assistance from Screaming Trees members Mark Lanegan and Gary Lee Conner (who plays a brief guitar solo on Midnight a Go-Go), except Cat Walk, produced by Patrick Maley, and The This Many Boyfriends Club, recorded live by Rich Jensen.  The album marks a darker approach to the Twee pop for which the band is known, due largely to a thicker production than is present on the group's earlier recordings and the dominance of tracks written by Calvin Johnson, while Heather Lewis only provides vocals on two songs, the uncharacteristically brash In Between and the more typically understated Ask Me.  At the time of the album's release, Calvin described Jamboree's sound as dark and sexy.  Still, the band retained their emphasis on exuberance over musicianship, as Bret Lunsford stated in an interview that, while recording album opener Bewitched, his guitar string got stuck on a protruding screw and he continued to play through the song, hitting the string a bit harder until it became unstuck. Gary Lee Conner (born Lee Gary Conner on August 22, 1962 in Fort Irwin, California, USA) was the lead guitarist for rock act Screaming Trees, along with his brother Van Conner, who was the band's bassist.  Conner began his career with Screaming Trees in 1985 which lasted until their disbanding in 2000.  During that time he released two non-Tree albums: The Purple Outside-Mystery Lane (1990 New Alliance Records) with brother Patrick Conner on Drums and the single Grasshopper's Daydream/Behind The Smile (1999 sub pop) this album also featured Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age.  Appearances on other artists material include, Beat Happening Indian Summer and Midnight a Go-Go from Jamboree as well as Against the 70s by Mike Watt from Ball-Hog or Tugboat?  (1995 Columbia Records).  After ten years of seclusion he finally released a new album in 2010 from his band Microdot Gnome.  The album 4D Sugarcubes was released on Moonbus International Recordings in April 2010 as was available on CD and MP3.  At the moment he is planning future releases from Microdot Gnome.  In August 2016, Conner released a long-awaited solo album, Ether Trippers, on Strange Earth Records. Mad Season was an American rock supergroup formed in Seattle, Washington in 1994 by members of three popular Seattle-based bands: Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam and Screaming Trees.  Mad Season released only one album, Above, and is best known for the single River of Deceit.  The band went on a semi-permanent hiatus in 1996 due to the band members' conflicting schedules and vocalist Layne Staley's problems with substance abuse.  Attempts were made in the late 1990s to revive the group without Staley; however, the band dissolved following the death of bassist John Baker Saunders in 1999.  Staley died three years later of a drug overdose. Beat Happening/Screaming Trees is an EP and a one-off collaboration between Beat Happening (from Olympia, Washington) and Screaming Trees (from Ellensburg, Washington).  Originally released on Homestead Records in 1988, it was later reissued as part of Beat Happening's box set Crashing Through in 2002.  The journal of Kurt Cobain contains a draft of a letter sent to Mark Lanegan, in which he described Polly Pereguin as his favorite pop song of the 1980s. Screaming Trees was an American rock band formed in Ellensburg, Washington in 1985 by vocalist Mark Lanegan, guitarist Gary Lee Conner, bass player Van Conner and drummer Mark Pickerel.  Pickerel had been replaced by Barrett Martin by the time the band reached its most successful period.  Although widely associated with grunge, the band's sound incorporated hard rock and psychedelic elements.  During Screaming Trees' existence the band released seven studio albums, five EPs, and three compilations. The discography of Screaming Trees, an Ellensburg, Washington-based rock band, consists of seven studio albums, three compilation albums, five extended plays (EP), and six singles, though this does not include any solo material recorded by the individual members of Screaming Trees. Van Conner (born March 17, 1967 in Apple Valley, California) is an American rock musician.  In 1984 he co-founded the band Screaming Trees with his brother Gary Lee Conner and close friends Mark Lanegan and Mark Pickerel.

The Socialist Revolutionary Party, a major political force in early 20th-century Russia, played a significant role in the Russian Revolution. Their ideology was revolutionary socialism with democratic and agrarian socialist elements. After the February Revolution, the party joined the Provisional Government, but the Bolsheviks disbanded the government in November 1917. The party split into pro-Bolshevik and anti-Bolshevik factions, with the latter being defeated and destroyed by the Bolsheviks. The Russian Civil War began after the October Revolution, and the Bolsheviks formed the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The Communist Reds emerged victorious in 1922, marking the beginning of the Soviet Union. Lenin, the leader of the Communist Party, ruled until 1924 and encouraged political paranoia. The Kornilov Affair, an attempt to strengthen the Provisional Government, ultimately undermined it and led to the rise of the Bolsheviks. Left-wing uprisings against the Bolsheviks began soon after the October Revolution and continued until 1924. The Bolsheviks suppressed these groups with force, and the Russian Civil War ended in 1923 with the Red Army defeated. The war resulted in an estimated 7-12 million casualties, and the Russian Civil War has been described as the greatest national catastrophe Europe had yet seen.

He is married with two children and lives in Lucca. Aldo Pontremoli (] ; 19 January 1896 – 25 May 1928) was an Italian physicist who held a chair of theoretical physics at the University of Milan from 1926 and who founded and directed the Institute of Advanced Physics at the University of Milan from 1924 until his disappearance and presumed death in May 1928.  Pontremoli was one of the six men who disappeared with the airborne envelope of the airship Italia after it had crashed on the Arctic ice on 25 May 1928. Enrico Fermi ( ; ] ; 29 September 1901 – 28 November 1954) was an Italian physicist and the creator of the world's first nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1.  He has been called the architect of the nuclear age and the architect of the atomic bomb.  He was one of the very few physicists in history to excel both theoretically and experimentally.  Fermi held several patents related to the use of nuclear power, and was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on induced radioactivity by neutron bombardment and the discovery of transuranic elements.  He made significant contributions to the development of quantum theory, nuclear and particle physics, and statistical mechanics. The 12-volume Micropædia is one of the three parts of the 15th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica, the other two being the one-volume Propædia and the 17-volume Macropædia.  The name Micropædia is a neologism coined by Mortimer J. Adler from the ancient Greek words for small and instruction; the best English translation is perhaps brief lessons. Claudio Pellegrini (born in Rome on May 9, 1935) is an Italian physicist known for his pioneering work on X-ray free electron lasers and collective effects in relativistic particle beams.  He was educated at the Sapienza University of Rome where he received the Laurea in Fisica summa cum laude in 1958 and the Libera Docenza, in 1965.  From 1958 to 1978, he worked at the Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati for high energy and nuclear physics.  In the early 1960s, he was at the Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics (NORDITA) in Copenhagen, working on an alternative formulation of the theory of general relativity using tetrad fields to obtain, among other things, a better description of the energy-momentum complex.  (See Teleparallelism for a summary of the theoretical context of this work.)  In 1978, he moved to the United States and began work at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where he was an Associate Chairman of the National Synchrotron Light Source and co-director at the Center for Accelerator Physics.  In 1989, he accepted an appointment at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) as a professor of physics, and later became a Distinguished Professor. Carlo Rovelli (born 3 May 1956) is an Italian theoretical physicist and writer who has worked in Italy, the United States and since 2000, in France.  His work is mainly in the field of quantum gravity, where he is among the founders of the loop quantum gravity theory.  He has also worked in the history and philosophy of science.  He collaborates regularly with several Italian newspapers, in particular the cultural supplements of Il Corriere della Sera, Il Sole 24 Ore and La Repubblica. Chiara R. Nappi is an Italian physicist.  Her research areas have included mathematical physics, particle physics, and string theory. Sergio Ferrara (born May 2, 1945) is an Italian physicist working on theoretical physics of elementary particles and mathematical physics.  He is renowned for the discovery of theories introducing supersymmetry as a symmetry of elementary particles (super-Yang–Mills theories, together with Bruno Zumino) and of supergravity, the first significant extension of Einstein's general relativity, based on the principle of local supersymmetry (together with Daniel Z. Freedman, and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen).  He is an emeritus staff member at CERN and a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Antonino Lo Surdo (4 February 1880 in Syracuse – 7 June 1949 in Rome) was an Italian physicist.  He was appointed as professor of physics at the Istituto di Fisica in Rome in 1919; upon the death of Orso Mario Corbino in 1937, he became the director.  Lo Surdo studied terrestrial physics, including seismology and geophysics; the 1908 Messina earthquake caused the death of his parents and other close relatives, except his brother.  He contributed to the foundation of the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica under the auspices of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, when its president was Guglielmo Marconi. Seven Brief Lessons on Physics (Italian:  ) is a short book by the Italian physicist Carlo Rovelli.  Originally published in Italian in 2014, the book has been translated into 41 languages.

Lower-set with shorter legs, more muscular, and heavier bone density than its cousin the American Rat Terrier.  There is much diversity in the history of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier breed and it shares a common early history with the American Rat Terrier, Fox Paulistinha and Tenterfield Terrier.  It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants.  Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog.  It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry.  These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs.  Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect.  Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times. The Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog of the smooth-haired terrier type. A Feist is a small hunting dog, descended from the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants.  These terriers probably included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct English White Terrier.  These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners.  Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or Italian Greyhounds (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier. The English Setter is a medium size breed of dog.  It is part of the Setter family, which includes the red Irish Setters, Irish Red and White Setters, and black-and-tan Gordon Setters.  The mainly white body coat is of medium length with long silky fringes on the back of the legs, under the belly and on the tail.  The coat features flecks of colour, and the different colour varieties are referred to as belton. The Russian Toy (also known as the Russian Toy Terrier, and in Russia as the Russkiy Toy, Toychik,Russian: Русский той, Тойчик ) is a very small breed of dog originally bred in Russia from the English Toy Terrier which is known today as the Manchester Terrier.  There are two types of coats in the breed: smooth coat and long coat.  The smooth-coated variety was previously known as the Russian Toy Terrier and long-coated as the Moscow Long Haired Toy Terrier.  Both were brought together under the same Russian Toy Terrier name in 1988 and the Terrier was dropped from the name when the breed was added in 2006 to the official list of breeds registered with the Fédération Cynologique Internationale and has been registered in the Foundation Stock Service of the American Kennel Club since 2008, allowed to compete in AKC companion events since 2010.  The first official breed standard of the two varieties was written in 1966 in Russia. The viol , viola da gamba ] , or (informally) gamba, is any one of a family of bowed, fretted and stringed instruments with hollow wooden bodies and pegboxes where the tension on the strings can be increased or decreased to adjust the pitch of each of the strings.  Frets on the viol are usually made of gut, tied on the fingerboard around the instrument's neck, to enable the performer to stop the strings more cleanly.  Frets improve consistency of intonation and lend the stopped notes a tone which better matches the open strings.  Viols first appeared in Spain in the mid to late 15th century and were most popular in the Renaissance and Baroque (1600-1750) periods.  Early ancestors include the Arabic rebab and the medieval European vielle, but later, more direct possible ancestors include the Venetian viole and the 15th- and 16th-century Spanish vihuela, a 6-course plucked instrument tuned like a lute (and also like a present-day viol) that looked like but was quite distinct from (at that time) the 4-course guitar (an earlier chordophone). The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds.  The type originated in Scotland and Northern England.  The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout.  Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders.  Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct.  Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types.  Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability.  While the AKC has a breed they call Collie, in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds.  There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports.  They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity. The Scotch Collie is a landrace breed of dog which originated from the highland regions of Scotland.  The breed consisted of both the long-haired (now known as Rough) Collie and the short-haired (now known as Smooth) Collie.  It is generally believed to have descended from a variety of ancient herding dogs, some dating back to the Roman occupation, which may have included Roman Cattle Dogs, Native Celtic Dogs and Viking Herding Spitzes.  Other ancestors include the Gordon and Irish Setters. The Toy Manchester Terrier is a breed of dog, categorized as a terrier.  The breed was bred down in size in North America from the Manchester Terrier, and is placed in the Toy Group by the American Kennel Club and the Canadian Kennel Club (the Manchester Terrier is placed in the Terrier Group.)  Neither the Fédération Cynologique Internationale nor The Kennel Club recognize a Toy variety of the Manchester Terrier. Florence Nagle (26 October 1894 – 30 October 1988) was a trainer and breeder of racehorses, a breeder of pedigree dogs, and an active feminist.  Nagle purchased her first Irish Wolfhound in 1913, and went on to own or breed twenty-one United Kingdom Champions.  Best in Show at Crufts in 1960 was awarded to Sulhamstead Merman, who was bred, owned and exhibited by Nagle.  She also competed successfully in field trials with Irish Setters, from the 1920s until the mid-1960s resulting in eighteen Field Trial Champions.  The male dog who was a linchpin in the 1970s revival of the Irish Red and White Setter breed was descended from one of Nagle's Irish Setters. [/INST]

The breed shares ancestry with other dogs such as the Feist, Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, and the now-extinct English White Terrier. This diverse ancestry has given the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier a keen sense of awareness, prey drive, and an acute sense of smell.

response:    Rephrased Paragraph:

The First Italo-Ethiopian War was fought between Italy and Ethiopia from 1895 to 1896, stemming from a disputed treaty that the Italians claimed turned Ethiopia into an Italian protectorate. The Ethiopian ruler, Menelik II, was supported by other nations such as Russia, the United Kingdom, and France, who saw Ethiopia as a potential ally against Italian colonial expansion. The war began in 1895, with Italian troops initially achieving success, but Ethiopian forces counterattacked and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, leading to their defeat and retreat back into Eritrea. The decisive Battle of Adwa was fought on March 1, 1896, resulting in a crushing defeat for the Italians and securing Ethiopian sovereignty. The Treaty of Addis Ababa, signed on October 23, 1896, formally ended the war on terms favorable to Ethiopia, with the Italians recognizing Ethiopia's independence and abrogating the Treaty of Wuchale.

The Scottish Borders, also known as The Mairches, borders the City of Edinburgh, Dumfries and Galloway, East Lothian, Midlothian, South Lanarkshire, West Lothian, and Northumberland in England. The administrative center of the area is Newtown St Boswells. Dirleton Kirk, located in Dirleton, East Lothian, is situated near the village green and is at grid reference NT512842. Dirleton is a village and parish in East Lothian, approximately 20 miles east of Edinburgh on the A198. The village contains 7,500 acres and is bordered by North Berwick, Gullane, Fenton Barns, and the Yellowcraigs nature reserve. Gullane parish was joined to Dirleton parish in 1612 by an Act of Parliament due to Gullane being a decaying town and Dirleton being a thriving place. The Royal Burgh of Haddington, the main administrative, cultural, and geographical center of East Lothian, is a town located about 20 miles east of Edinburgh. The town received burghal status during the reign of David I, giving it trading rights that encouraged its growth into a market town. Yellowcraig, a coastal area of forest, beach, and grassland, is located in East Lothian and is bordered by the Firth of Forth, Dirleton Castle, and the Archerfield Estate. Dirleton Castle, a medieval fortress located in the village of Dirleton, was abandoned by the end of the 17th century.

This box set is similar to the earlier Pebbles Box (a 5-LP box set) and includes almost all of the same recordings in that box set (and in the same order), along with numerous bonus tracks at the end of each disc.  Supposedly, the Trash Box collects the first five volumes of the CDs in the Pebbles series (i.e., those released by AIP Records, not to be confused with the 4 earlier CDs that were issued by ESD Records).  However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on Pebbles, Volume 4 have been eschewed entirely.  Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the Pebbles Box.  Although most of the recordings on the Trash Box were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series.  Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit I Fought the Law (but the Law Won) by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) – which is also included in the Pebbles Box – in place of the much rarer Wine Wine Wine by Bobby Fuller that appears on Pebbles, Volume 2. Chrome, Smoke & BBQ is a box set by American blues-rock band ZZ Top, released in 2003.  At the time of release, this box set was notable for using the original mixes for all of the tracks from the band's first five albums for the first time on the CD format.  This box set, and the companion release Rancho Texicano, were the only two CD releases which featured original mixes from ZZ Top's First Album, Rio Grande Mud, and Tejas, aside from 1977's The Best of ZZ Top which features two tracks from Rio Grande Mud and one track from First Album.  Tres Hombres and Fandango!  were reissued in their original mixes in 2006, and in 2013, Warner Brothers released the CD box set 'The Complete Studio Albums 1970-1990' which includes the first ten ZZ Top studio albums, all with the original mixes. Back to Mono (1958–1969) is a box set (4 compact discs or 5 vinyl LPs) compilation of the recorded work of record producer Phil Spector, through the 1960s, released in 1991 by ABKCO as #7118-2.  The first track, To Know Him Is to Love Him, released in 1958, features Spector performing as part of the group the Teddy Bears.  Initially a vinyl album-sized package, the box contained a booklet with photographs, complete song lyrics, discographical information, and a reproduction of the essay on Spector by Tom Wolfe, The First Tycoon of Teen.  The package also contained a small, round, red Back to Mono pin. Live in Japan is a four-disc box set by American saxophonist John Coltrane and his last group, featuring the quintet of Coltrane, his wife/pianist Alice, saxophonist/bass clarinetist Pharoah Sanders, bassist Jimmy Garrison and drummer Rashied Ali.  The 4-CD set compiles all the music issued as three albums in the seventies by Impulse! ; Concert In Japan (1973, US 2-LP, electronically processed for compatible quadrophonic/stereo), Coltrane In Japan (1974, Japan 3-LP (side six is blank), mono) and Second Night In Tokyo (1976, Japan 3-LP (side six contains an interview, mono).  (Some of this material was also reissued as two 2-LP sets in 1980 by MCA under the titles Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  1 and Coltrane In Tokyo Vol.  2) The first CD issues were by Impulse!  Japan as two 2-CD sets: Live In Japan Vol.  1 (same as Coltrane In Japan) and Live In Japan Vol.  2 (same as Second Night In Tokyo).  The US 4-CD edition includes both of these volumes, with identical mastering from the original mono tapes.  The side six interview from Second Night In Tokyo has never been reissued on any CD edition. Nashville Rebel is a box set by Waylon Jennings, released on RCA Records through Legacy Recordings in 2006.  According to Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, it is the first comprehensive, multi-label Waylon Jennings retrospective ever assembled, comprising ninety-two songs recorded between 1958 and 1994, with selections from the majority of the singer's recording career.  The first track of the box set is the Buddy Holly-produced Jole Blon, released in 1958, while the last is I Do Believe, a song produced by Don Was that was included on The Highwaymen's 1995 release, The Road Goes on Forever.  The other material on the box set covers Jennings' career chronologically, with songs ranging from his years on RCA's roster to later compositions from his short-lived stay at Epic Records; it ignores, however, the tracks from Jennings albums released on independent labels.  The majority of the singer's charting singles are included in the package, as are collaborations such as Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys with Willie Nelson and Highwayman with The Highwaymen.  A notable addition is the previously unreleased The Greatest Cowboy of Them All, a 1978 duet with Johnny Cash which was later recorded by Cash alone for A Believer Sings the Truth (1979) and The Mystery of Life (1991); two others, It's Sure Been Fun and People in Dallas Got Hair, had never been released in the United States.  Nashville Rebel was released on four CDs, with a 140-page booklet and liner notes by Rich Keinzle and Lenny Kaye. Radiohead Box Set is a box set of the first six studio albums and one live album by the English rock band Radiohead, released on 10 December 2007.  The box set is available as a seven CD box set, a digital download and a 4GB USB Stick.  The box set peaked at #95 in Canada's album charts. Mono Masters is a compilation album by the Beatles, and is an alternate, all-mono version of the album Past Masters.  Mono Masters was originally a two-CD set included as part of The Beatles in Mono box set.  The premise of this box set was to compile only Beatles material which was released or prepared for release with a dedicated mono mix (the set excludes later material mixed and released only in stereo, and material whose mono version was simply created as an equal mix of the two channels of the stereo version).  As a result, the track listing for Mono Masters differs from Past Masters on the second half of disc two, omitting some later songs that never had a mono mix (Old Brown Shoe, The Ballad of John and Yoko and Let It Be), and adding several songs released on stereo-only albums that had unreleased mono mixes.  Tracks 9–12 and 15 were prepared in March 1969 for release as a 7 mono Yellow Submarine EP, two months after the release of the similarly titled soundtrack album, but the project was scrapped, although the EP was mastered.  Subsequently, the tracks were only released in stereo (and in an electronically produced mono mixdown, or fold-down, of the stereo mix), while the true mono mixes remained unreleased.  Get Back (with B-side Don't Let Me Down) was the final Beatles single mixed for mono format.  It was released in the UK in mono, though the US release was in stereo.  Thus, the songs that were originally released on stereo singles in the UK are omitted on this release. Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 is a double album released by Atlantic Records on 21 September 1993.  This box set features the rest of the English rock band Led Zeppelin's catalogue not included in the 1990 4-CD box set Led Zeppelin, all digitally remastered, including the previously unreleased studio track Baby Come On Home.  A 54-page booklet was also included with the release.  Between this box set and the 4-CD box set every track from the band's nine studio albums are featured along with two BBC live recordings; the band's only non-LP b-side; and one studio outtake. To Know Him Is to Love Him is a song written by Phil Spector, inspired by words on his father's tombstone, To Know Him Was To Love Him.  It was first recorded by the only vocal group of which he was a member, the Teddy Bears.  Their recording spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart in 1958, while reaching No. 2 on UK's New Musical Express chart.  Peter & Gordon and Bobby Vinton later had hits with the song, with its title and lyrics changed to To Know You Is to Love You.  In 1987, the song was resurrected by Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris, whose Trio recording topped the U.S. country singles charts.  The song is in 12/8 time. The Doors: Vinyl Box Set is the seventh box set for the rock band The Doors.  It is a 7 record set of the original 6 Doors albums, remastered in stereo from the original analogue tapes with a mono version of the debut album.  Artwork, packaging, and inner sleeves are replicas of the originals from 1967-1971.  The box set was originally planned to be released in October 2007, but was delayed due to a problem with the vinyl, as well as other problems in the production of the box set.  The delay ran until February 2008.  Reasons for the delay included faulty test pressings, inferiority of the L.A. Woman artwork, and bad compounds in the vinyl that was used first, which caused a search for a new source of virgin vinyl. [/INST]

It is a herbaceous annual, occasionally biennial or a short-lived perennial plant, growing to between 40-80 centimetres tall.  It is also known in the USA as bladder campion but should not be confused with Silene vulgaris, which is more generally called Bladder Campion. Silene tomentosa, the Gibraltar campion, is a very rare flowering plant of the genus Silene and the family Caryophyllaceae.  It is a woody-based perennial about 40cm high, with bilobed flowers ranging from pink to pale violet and is endemic to Gibraltar. Silene conoidea is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names weed silene and large sand catchfly.  It is native to Eurasia, and it is known in other parts of the world, such as western North America, as a weed.  It is an annual herb growing up to a meter in height with a hairy, partially glandular stem.  The lance-shaped leaves are up to 12 centimeters long near the base of the plant and smaller farther up.  The flower is enclosed in an inflated, hairy, glandular calyx of fused sepals which is ridged with many veins.  It is open at the top, revealing five bright pink petals. Silene is a genus of flowering plants in the family Caryophyllaceae.  Containing approximately 700 species, it is the largest genus in the family.  Common names include campion (which is shared with the related genus Lychnis) and catchfly.  Many Silene species are widely distributed, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Silene stenophylla is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae.  Commonly called narrow-leafed campion, it is a species in the genus Silene.  It grows in the Arctic tundra of far eastern Siberia and the mountains of Northern Japan.  Frozen samples, estimated via radiocarbon dating to be around 32,000 years old, were discovered in the same area as current living specimens, and in 2012 a team of scientists successfully regenerated a plant from the samples. Silene menziesii is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Menzies' campion and Menzies' catchfly.  It is native to western North America from Alaska through the western half of Canada to the southwestern United States.  It can be found in many types of habitat and it is quite common in much of its range.  It is variable in morphology and there are a number of varied subtaxa.  In general, it is a perennial herb growing from a caudex, appearing matlike, decumbent, or erect, with stems a few centimeters to over half a meter long.  It is usually hairy in texture, with upper parts bearing sticky glandular hairs.  The leaves are lance-shaped, oppositely arranged in pairs, and a few centimeters in length, upper leaves usually smaller than lower.  Flowers may occur in a cyme at the top of the stem, or in leaf axils, or both.  Each is encapsulated in a hairy, veined calyx of fused sepals.  The petals are white with two lobes at the tips.  The plant is dioecious with male and female plants producing different flowers.  The male and female flower types look the same externally; the stamens are reduced in female plants and the stigmas are reduced in the male. Silene suksdorfii is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Suksdorf's silene, Suksdorf's catchfly and Cascade alpine campion.  It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it occurs from Washington and Idaho to northern California.  It is mainly an alpine species, growing in the talus of high mountain slopes.  It can also be found below the tree line in forested subalpine habitat.  It is a squat perennial herb producing several erect stems from a leafy, woody caudex.  It generally takes a clumpy form.  The stems grow up to 10 or 15 centimeters tall and are hairy in texture, with glandular, sticky areas on the upper parts.  The leaves occur in tufts around the caudex.  They are fleshy and coated in soft hairs.  Solitary flowers arise on erect peduncles.  Each is encapsulated in an inflated calyx of fused sepals, which is starkly purple-veined and has purplish glandular hairs.  The petals are white or purple-tinged and have two lobes at their tips and appendages at their bases. Ferocactus is a genus of large barrel-shaped cacti, mostly with large spines and small flowers.  There are about 30 species included in the genus.  They are found in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Silene antirrhina is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names sleepy silene and sleepy catchfly.  It is native to the Americas, where it is widespread throughout North America and parts of South America.  It is known in Europe as an introduced species. Silene are a flowering plant that evolved a dioecious reproductive system.  This is made possible through heteromorphic sex chromosomes expressed as XY.  Silene recently evolved sex chromosomes 5-10 million years ago and are widely used by geneticists and biologists to study the mechanisms of sex determination since they are one of only 39 species across 14 families of angiosperm that possess sex-determining genes.  Silene are studied because of their ability to produce offspring with a plethora of reproductive systems.  The common inference drawn from such studies is that the sex of the offspring is determined by the Y chromosome. [/INST]

No. 2 Squadron, a Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) unit, has a rich history dating back to 1916 when it was formed as part of the Australian Flying Corps. During World War I, the squadron operated on the Western Front, conducting fighter sweeps and ground-attack missions. After the war, the squadron was disbanded, but it was briefly re-raised in 1922 as part of the newly independent RAAF. During World War II, the squadron saw action as a bomber unit in the South West Pacific theatre, equipped with English Electric Canberra jets. The squadron was again disbanded in 1982, following the retirement of the Canberra. It was re-formed in 2000 to operate the Boeing 737 AEW&C Wedgetail, and one of the aircraft was deployed to the Middle East in 2014 as part of Australia's contribution to the military coalition against ISIS.

The South West Pacific theatre, defined by the Allied powers' South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command, included the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (except for Sumatra), Borneo, Australia, and its mandate Territory of New Guinea. The English Electric Canberra, a British jet-powered medium bomber, was developed in response to a 1944 Air Ministry requirement for a successor to the wartime de Havilland Mosquito fast-bomber. The squadron also operated the Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 Sparviero, a three-engined Italian medium bomber, during World War II.

The SWPA was one of four major Allied commands in the Pacific War, and it primarily consisted of United States and Australian forces, although Dutch, Filipino, British, and other Allied forces also served in the SWPA. The Tupolev Tu-12, an experimental Soviet jet-powered medium bomber, was developed after the end of World War II. No. 12 Squadron, a RAAF general purpose, bomber, and transport squadron, was formed in 1939 and saw combat in the South West Pacific theatre of World War II. The Coastwatchers, a network of Allied military intelligence operatives stationed on remote Pacific islands, played a significant role in the Pacific Ocean theatre and South West Pacific theatre, particularly as an early warning network during the Guadalcanal campaign. Colonel Edwin A. Doss, an American fighter pilot and commander in the U.S. Air Force during World War II and Korean War, logged over 4,500 flying hours and received numerous awards for his service, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, Legion of Merit, and Air Medal. His service was integral to the development of long-range fighter tactics in the South West Pacific Theater.

Ron Bottcher, an American operatic baritone, was active in the 1960s, performing with both the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera. Born in Sandpoint, Idaho, Bottcher earned music degrees from the University of Montana and the Curtis Institute of Music. He made his debut at the Santa Fe Opera in 1961, portraying roles such as Leopold in Richard Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier and Marcello in Puccini's La bohème. His roles at the NYCO included Escamillo in Bizet's Carmen and Sharpless in Puccini's Madama Butterfly. At the Met, he created roles in the world premieres of Samuel Barber's Antony and Cleopatra and Marvin David Levy's Mourning Becomes Electra. Bottcher passed away at the age of 50 due to AIDS-related illness.

La bohème, an opera by Puccini, was adapted into a 1988 Italian-French film directed by Luigi Comencini. The opera is based on Puccini's La bohème, and features the famous aria "O mio babbino caro." Franco Corelli, an Italian tenor, was known for his powerful voice and charismatic stage presence. He had a long and successful career with the Metropolitan Opera and other major opera houses in Europe and North America. O mio babbino caro is a soprano aria from Gianni Schicchi, one of Puccini's most popular operas. It is sung by Lauretta, who expresses her love for Rinuccio in a lyrical and simple manner, contrasting with the hypocrisy and jealousy surrounding them.

La fanciulla del West, another opera by Puccini, is based on a play by David Belasco and features a more integrated score and impressive orchestration. It has fewer show-stopping highlights than other Puccini works, but is admired for its melodic integration. Tosca, an Italian musical film directed by Carmine Gallone, is based on Puccini's opera of the same name. The Festival Puccini is an annual summer opera festival held in July and August to present Puccini's operas. Cesira Ferrani, an Italian operatic soprano, debuted two iconic roles in Puccini's operas, Mimì in La bohème and the title role in Manon Lescaut. Jacopo Puccini was an 18th-century Italian composer who lived and worked in Lucca, Tuscany, and was the first of five generations of composers, including his great-great-grandson, the famous opera composer Giacomo Puccini.

He played for the Oakland Raiders, Cincinnati Bengals, and Boston Patriots, and was a key player in the Raiders' AFL championship season. After his playing career ended, Herock became a player personnel executive in the NFL, working for the Raiders, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Atlanta Falcons. One of his notable moves was trading Brett Favre from the Falcons to the Green Bay Packers. The 1990 Atlanta Falcons season was the team's 25th season in the NFL, and saw the franchise improve on its previous record, finishing 5-11. However, the team missed the playoffs for the eighth straight season.

Jerry Glanville, a former NFL coach, was known for his outspoken personality and made headlines for his comments about the Houston Oilers' field being the "house of pain." He coached the Oilers from 1986 to 1990 and the Atlanta Falcons from 1990 to 1994. Glanville has also worked as an analyst on HBO's Inside the NFL and CBS's The NFL Today/NFL on CBS.

Keith Bostic, an American software engineer, was a key figure in the history of Berkeley Software Distribution UNIX and open-source software. He played safety for the Houston Oilers and the Cleveland Browns, and served as the Oilers' defensive captain under Glanville. Bostic earned one Pro Bowl selection and missed another based on a tiebreaker for the last safety chosen. He led the American Football Conference in interceptions in his Pro Bowl season.

The 1989 season was the Houston Oilers' 30th season and their 20th in the NFL. The team scored 365 points and allowed 412 points, resulting in a 9-7 record and a second-place finish in the AFC Central Division. The Oilers appeared on Monday Night Football and in the playoffs for the third consecutive year, but lost to the Bengals 61-7 in their second-to-last game. This was the worst defeat for the team during its tenure in Houston.

response:    Here is the rephrased passage with a more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structure:

Fokienia is a genus of coniferous trees that belongs to the cypress family (Cupressaceae). Characterized by intermediate characteristics between the genera Chamaecyparis and Calocedrus, Fokienia is genetically closer to the former and is not always recognized as a distinct genus. The sole living species, Fokienia hodginsii (also known as Fujian cypress or Pơmu in Vietnamese), and one fossil species (Fokienia ravenscragensis) are included in the genus. The Frenchman Formation, a stratigraphic unit of Late Cretaceous (late Maastrichtian) age, is found in southern Saskatchewan and the Cypress Hills of southeastern Alberta. This formation is notable for containing the youngest dinosaur remains, similar to those found in the Hell Creek Formation in the United States.

Ajuga, also known as bugleweed, ground pine, carpet bugle, or simply bugle, is a genus of herbaceous flowering plants in the mint family (Lamiaceae). With over 40 species native to Europe, Asia, Africa, and southeastern Australia, these plants grow to heights of 5–50 cm, with opposite leaves. The Cupressus genus, which includes several species of cypress trees, is considered a polyphyletic group and is found in the Cupressoideae subfamily. The common name "cypress" originates from Old French cipres and Latin cyparissus, which is the Latinized form of the Greek κυπάρισσος (kyparissos).

Cedrol, a sesquiterpene alcohol found in the essential oil of conifers, particularly in the genera Cupressus (cypress) and Juniperus (juniper), is used in the chemistry of aroma compounds. Libocedrus is a genus of five coniferous tree species native to New Zealand and New Caledonia, with generic names meaning "teardrop cedar." Pilgerodendron is a genus of conifers with only one species, Pilgerodendron uviferum, found in southern Chile and southwestern Argentina, and is the southernmost conifer in the world. Cypress-pine is a common name used for three closely related genera of conifers in the cypress family Cupressaceae, including Ajugeae, Acrymia, Ajuga, Cymaria, Garrettia, and Holocheila.

They play in the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA).  The Hornets were first established in 1988 as an expansion team, but relocated to New Orleans following the 2001–02 season.  In 2004, a new expansion team, the Charlotte Bobcats, was established.  After 10 seasons as the Bobcats, the team changed its name to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014–15 season, a year after the New Orleans franchise relinquished the Hornets name and renamed itself the Pelicans.  In addition to re-inheriting the Hornets name from New Orleans, the Charlotte franchise reclaimed the history and records of the original 1988–2002 Hornets, effectively becoming a continuation of the original franchise. The Texas Tech Lady Raiders basketball team, representing Texas Tech University, has had 9 players drafted into the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) since the league began holding drafts in 1997.  Sheryl Swoopes was Texas Tech's first player drafted in the WNBA, selected in the 1997 Initial Player Allocation.  The Charlotte Sting had drafted three Lady Raiders, more than any other WNBA franchise: Michi Atkins, in the WNBA Elite Draft, and Angie Braziel and Jia Perkins during the college draft. The 1992–93 NBA season was the fifth season for the Charlotte Hornets in the National Basketball Association.  In the 1992 NBA draft, the Hornets selected center Alonzo Mourning out of Georgetown with the second overall pick.  With the addition of Mourning, along with second-year star Larry Johnson and Muggsy Bogues, the Hornets struggled around .500 for most of the season, but won 9 of their final 12 games finishing their season third in the Central Division with a 44–38 record, and qualified for their first ever playoff appearance.  The team became the first of the four expansion franchises of the late 1980s to win a playoff series, when Mourning sunk a 20 ft jumper at the buzzer in Game 4 of the first round playoff series against the 4th-seeded Boston Celtics.  However, in the semifinals, the Hornets were eliminated by the New York Knicks in five games. The original Charlotte Hornets of the National Basketball Association (NBA) were established in 1988 as an expansion team, based in Charlotte, North Carolina.  The team's roster was filled with unprotected players at the 1988 NBA Expansion Draft, and five days later the Hornets made their first picks out of college players at the 1988 NBA draft.  The Hornets remained in Charlotte for 14 seasons before relocating to New Orleans in 2002.  Two years after the Hornets' departure, the Charlotte Bobcats were established in 2004.  The Bobcats first participated in the 2004 NBA draft, two days after their expansion draft was held.  The franchise's name was changed back to the Hornets at the conclusion of the 2013–14 season, one year after the team in Louisiana renamed itself the New Orleans Pelicans.

She was also a member of gold-medal winning USA Basketball World University Games Team in 2001.  Walker was drafted as the 20th overall pick by the Detroit Shock in the 2002 WNBA Draft.  As a member of the Shock, she won the 2003 WNBA Championship.  On July 3, 2005, Walker signed with the Charlotte Sting.  After the Sting franchise folded, Walker was drafted by Los Angeles Sparks as the 12th pick in the dispersal draft on January 8, 2007.  She returned to Detroit for her final season in 2007. The 2003 WNBA Season was the Women's National Basketball Association's seventh season.  It was first season in which teams either folded or relocated, as well as the first to have teams that were not co-owned with NBA teams.  The Orlando Miracle relocated to Connecticut and became the Connecticut Sun, the Utah Starzz relocated to San Antonio, Texas and became the San Antonio Silver Stars.  Meanwhile, both the Miami Sol and the Portland Fire folded, while the Charlotte Sting became the second WNBA team without a brother NBA team.  The schedule increased from 32 games per team to 34, where it stands to this day.  The season ended with the Detroit Shock winning their first WNBA Championship.

The Hornets name was left available after the New Orleans Hornets became the New Orleans Pelicans.  As part of a deal between the Bobcats, Hornets and NBA, the renamed Hornets reclaimed the original Hornets' history and records from 1988 to 2002, while all of the Hornets' records from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans.  As a result, the Hornets are now reckoned as having suspended operations after the 2001–02 season before returning as the Bobcats in 2004; This has allowed all of Charlotte's NBA history to be recognized under one single franchise. The Charlotte Hornets are an American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Adeline Virginia Woolf (née Stephen; 25 January 1882 – 28 March 1941) was an English writer who is considered one of the foremost modernists of the twentieth century, and a pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative device.  Born in an affluent household in Kensington, London, she attended the King's College London and was acquainted with the early reformers of women's higher education. Orlando: A Biography is a novel by Virginia Woolf, first published on 11 October 1928.  A high-spirited romp inspired by the tumultuous family history of Woolf's lover and close friend, the aristocratic poet and novelist Vita Sackville-West, it is arguably one of Woolf's most popular novels: a history of English literature in satiric form.  The book describes the adventures of a poet who changes sex from man to woman and lives for centuries, meeting the key figures of English literary history.  Considered a feminist classic, the book has been written about extensively by scholars of women's writing and gender and transgender studies. Me!  I'm Afraid of Virginia Woolf is a 1978 television play by Alan Bennett, produced by London Weekend Television and directed by Stephen Frears.  The title of the play is a parody of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? , which in turn plays on the title of the Disney song Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf? . Rev Dr Jane de Gay is a British academic and lecturer who has earned a reputation as an expert on the life and works of Virginia Woolf.  Dr de Gay's works on Woolf include a series of articles and a 2006 book, Virginia Woolf's Novels and the Literary Past, published by Edinburgh University Press.  Her work has been recognised by the Virginia Woolf Society of Great Britain.  She has co-edited four books on gender and theatre, including Languages of Theatre Shaped by Women (with Lizbeth Goodman). Freshwater is a two-act chamber opera composed by Andy Vores, based on the 1929 comic play by Virginia Woolf.  Vores received assistance in creating the opera from Quentin Bell, Woolf's nephew and executor, who provided a rarely seen earlier version of the text that served as the inspiration for several passages of the libretto. The Duchess and the Jeweller (1938) is a short story by Virginia Woolf.  Woolf, being an advocate of addressing the stream of consciousness, shows the thoughts and actions of a greedy jeweller; Woolf makes a thematic point that corrupt people do corrupt actions for purely selfish motives (and often without regret).  It was first published in British Harper's Bazaar Magazine in April 1938 and subsequently published posthumously in 1944 in the collection A Haunted House and Other Short Stories. Moments of Being is a collection of posthumously-published autobiographical essays by Virginia Woolf.  The collection was first found in the papers of her husband, used by Quentin Bell in his biography of Virginia Woolf, published in 1972.

The original texts are now housed at Sussex University and in the British Library in London. Jane Marcus (1938–2015) was a pioneering feminist literary scholar, specializing in women writers of the Modernist era, but especially in the social and political context of their writings.  Focusing on Virginia Woolf, Rebecca West, and Nancy Cunard, among many others, she devised groundbreaking analyses of Woolf's writings, upending a generation of criticism that ignored feminist, pacifist, and socialist themes in much of Woolf's work and critique of imperialism and bourgeois society.  Marcus's understanding of Woolf's place within the larger context of English literature has become prevailing wisdom today in the fields affected by her theorization and research, despite the controversial nature of her positions when they were originally formulated and how much opposition she garnered from earlier scholars and critics.

William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is a timeless tale that has been adapted into numerous theatrical releases, including George Cukor's Oscar-nominated 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet. These productions have cemented the play's status as one of the most-screened works of all time. The latter two films were particularly notable for their high box office grosses and innovative approaches to the classic tale. In Romeo + Juliet, Luhrmann produced a heavily cut fast-paced version aimed at teenage audiences, featuring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes in the leading roles. The film's success can be attributed to its fresh take on the classic story, as well as its talented cast and crew.

Romeo Montague, the protagonist of William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet, is a young man from the House of Montague who falls in love with Juliet, a member of the rival House of Capulet. Despite their families' animosity towards each other, Romeo and Juliet secretly marry and are forced into exile after Romeo slays Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, in a duel. Tragically, Romeo mistakenly believes that Juliet has died and commits suicide, leading to her actual death and the downfall of both families.

The phrase "a rose by any other name would smell as sweet" is a reference to William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, in which Juliet argues that the name "Montague" does not define Romeo's true nature. This phrase has become a popular saying to suggest that the names of things do not affect their true essence.

In addition to the theatrical releases, Romeo and Juliet has also been adapted into an anime television series, Romeo × Juliet, which loosely based on Shakespeare's play but includes numerous references and characters from other Shakespearean works. The series was broadcast in Japan and later dubbed into English and released by Funimation Entertainment.

Other notable adaptations of Romeo and Juliet include the 1982 film The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, directed by William Woodman and starring Alex Hyde-White and Blanche Baker as the titular characters. James Gunn, an American screenwriter, director, and musician, has also written and directed a web series called James Gunn's PG Porn, a pornography spoof that pairs mainstream actors with pornographic actresses and models.

Suburban Madness is an American crime drama television film, based on a true story, starring Sela Ward as PI Bobbi Bacha of Blue Moon Investigations.  It aired on CBS on October 3, 2004. Latvian names, like in most European cultures, consist of two main elements: the given name (vārds) followed by family name (uzvārds).  During the Soviet occupation (1940 - 1991) the practice of giving a middle name was discouraged, but since the restoration of Independence Latvian legislation again allows giving of up to two given names and it has become more common to give a middle name to children. Sela Ann Ward (born July 11, 1956) is an American actress, author and producer, best known for her roles on television beginning in the early '80s. Singh is a title, middle name or surname, which originated in India.  Derived from the Sanskrit word for lion, it was adopted as a title by certain warrior castes in India.  It was mandated by Guru Gobind Singh for all Sikhs.  It was later adopted by several castes and communities.  As a surname or a middle name, it is now found throughout the Indian subcontinent and among the Indian diaspora, cutting across communities and religious groups, becoming more of a title than a surname. Bobbi Bacha is a Texas Private Investigator portrayed in 2004 TV Sony Pictures Movie Suburban Madness played by actress Sela Ward.  Bobbi Bacha also was involved and worked on the case of New York millionaire Robert Durst who was charged with murder in Galveston, Texas for killing his neighbor Morris Black but was found not guilty by a Galveston County Jury. Jeff Strabone is a Brooklyn-based American scholar, political activist and civic leader.  In 2016, his website directelection.org listed the names and addresses of members of the U.S. Electoral College, and he urged people to write to electors to ask them not to vote for president-elect Donald Trump, an effort which brought him national attention.  As a civic leader in Brooklyn, he has been active in promoting theatre preservation, building codes and housing issues, hospital preservation, and traffic flow.  He has been a leader of Brooklyn's Cobble Hill Association, a neighborhood preservation group.  He is the co-founder and chairman of the New Brooklyn Theatre.  In 2008, he changed his middle name to Hussein as a show of solidarity with then presidential candidate Barack Obama, who was running for the office of president, and who had been criticized for his Muslim-sounding middle name.

According to Colin Meloy, as stated at the Pilgrimage Festival in Franklin, TN on September 27, 2015, Funk was originally given the middle name Ryman but a clerical error on his birth certificate resulted in his middle name being recorded as Lyman. In several cultures, people's names usually include one or more names in addition to the portion that is usually considered adequate to identify them.  In a number of cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, such a name is likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called a middle name.  In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names, occupying that position, even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a middle name, and is actually (to mention several types of atypical cases): [/INST]

Just before the 2016 conference of the European Association of Social Anthropologists, held at the University of Milano-Bicocca, he was selected as the EASA Book Series Editor.  Together with Han Vermeulen, he is co-convenor of the recently established History of Anthropology Network of the EASA. Participant observation is one type of data collection method typically used in qualitative research.  It is a widely used methodology in many disciplines, particularly cultural anthropology and (European) ethnology, less so in sociology, communication studies, human geography and social psychology.  Its aim is to gain a close and intimate familiarity with a given group of individuals (such as a religious, occupational, sub cultural group, or a particular community) and their practices through an intensive involvement with people in their cultural environment, usually over an extended period of time.  The method originated in the field research of social anthropologists, especially Bronisław Malinowski and his students in Britain, the students of Franz Boas in the United States, and in the later urban research of the Chicago School of sociology. Muted group theory (MGT) is developed by social anthropologists Edwin Ardener and Shirley Ardener in 1975.  The theory describes the relationship between a dominant group and its subordinate group(s): As the dominant group contributes mostly to the formulation of the language system, including the norms and vocabulary, members from the subordinate group have to learn and use the dominant-made language to express themselves.  However, this translation process may result in loss and distortion of information as the people from subordinate groups cannot articulate their ideas clearly.  The dominant may also ignore the voice of the lower-power.  All these may eventually lead to the mutedness of the subordinate group.  Although this theory is initially developed to study the different situations faced by women and men, it can also be applied to any marginalized group that is muted by the inadequacies of their languages.

Alfred Antony Francis Gell, {'1': , '2': , '3': , '4': } ( ; June 12, 1945 – January 28, 1997) was a British social anthropologist whose most influential work concerned art, language, symbolism and ritual.  He was trained by Edmund Leach (MPhil, Cambridge University) and Raymond Firth (PhD, London School of Economics) and did his fieldwork in Melanesia and tribal India.  Gell taught at the London School of Economics, among other places.  He was also a Fellow of the British Academy.  He died of cancer in 1997, at the age of 51. Coral Gardens and Their Magic, properly Coral Gardens and Their Magic: A Study of the Methods of Tilling the Soil and of Agricultural Rites in the Trobriand Islands, is the final book in anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski's ethnographic trilogy on the lives of the Trobriand Islanders.  It concentrates on the cultivation practices the Trobriand Islanders used to grow yams, taro, bananas and palms.  It describes the gardens in which the Trobrianders grew food as more than merely utilitarian spaces, even as works of art.  In 1988 Alfred Gell called the book still the best account of any primitive technological-cum-magical system, and unlikely ever to be superseded in this respect.  The book has been described as Malinowski's magnum opus. [/INST]

He is a software tester by profession, and also runs a slot car business and racing facility. Miner Memorial Library is the public library of Lempster, New Hampshire, located at 3 Second New Hampshire Turnpike.  The library occupies a single-story wood frame structure built in 1845 as a church for a Universalist congregation.  Despite significant alteration for its use as a library, the building remains a fine example of vernacular church architecture in Sullivan County.  The building was formally dedicated in 1927 to the memory of Lempster native Alonzo Ames Miner, a leading Universalist minister and president of Tufts College.  After years of declining attendance, the remaining congregants gave the building to the town in 1965.  The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Sullivan County is a county located in the U.S. state of New Hampshire.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 43,742, making it the second-least populous county in New Hampshire.

The population was estimated at 31,153 in 2016.  It is the county seat of Strafford County, and home to Wentworth-Douglass Hospital, the Woodman Institute Museum, and the Children's Museum of New Hampshire. Woodsville is a census-designated place (CDP) in the town of Haverhill in Grafton County, New Hampshire, U.S., along the Connecticut River at the mouth of the Ammonoosuc River.  The population was 1,126 at the 2010 census.

The county buildings are now located halfway between Woodsville and the village of North Haverhill to the south. Hampden County is a non-governmental county located in the Pioneer Valley of the state of Massachusetts, in the United States.  As of the 2010 census, Hampden County's population was 463,490.  Its traditional county seat is Springfield, the Connecticut River Valley's largest city, and economic and cultural capital.  Hampden County was split from Hampshire County in 1812, because Northampton, Massachusetts, was made Hampshire County's shire town in 1794; however, Springfield—theretofore Hampshire County's traditional shire town, dating back to its founding in 1636—grew at a pace far quicker than Northampton and was granted shire town-status over its own, southerly jurisdiction.  It was named for John Hampden.  To the north of Hampden County is modern-day Hampshire County; to the west is Berkshire County; to the east is Worcester County; to the south are Litchfield County, Hartford County, and Tolland County in Connecticut.

East Lempster is an unincorporated community in the town of Lempster in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States. The Gardnerville Branch Jail is a historic jail located at 1440 Courthouse St. in Gardnerville, Nevada.  The jail was built in 1910 and served as Douglas County's only jail from 1910 to 1915.  Prior to 1910, the only county jail was in Genoa, the county seat; however, since Gardnerville was several miles from Genoa, it resorted to housing prisoners in the local judge's granary.  As the granary was considered unfit for holding prisoners, the community petitioned the county to construct a new jail.  However, local leaders in Minden, who wanted to move the county seat to their town, protested the move, as they suspected that Gardnerville was attempting to claim the county seat itself.  Nonetheless, the county approved the construction of the new jail.  The jail housed its first prisoners before construction even finished, as the Genoa jail burned down; one prisoner was briefly chained to a post until the new jail could accommodate him.  Once completed, the jail served the county until 1915, when Minden became the county seat and opened its own county jail. Lempster is a town in Sullivan County, New Hampshire, United States.

It is also attended by members of the Cabinet of Mexico, the Congress of the Union, civil service employees, the Secretaries of National Defense and Navy, members of the Mexican Armed Forces and Federal Police, uniformed service veterans, the state diplomatic corps, delegations representing the religious sector, indigenous peoples, sports and the private sector, and the general public.  Seen on TV and the Internet and heard on radio, this is one of the biggest events of the year.  Taking part in this are members of the Mexican Armed Forces and the Federal Police. Fernando Tapias Stahelin (born July 14, 1943 - † September 27, 2015) was a General (retired) of Colombian Armed Forces.  He served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of Colombian Armed Forces for a period of four years (1998–2002) during the presidential term of president Andres Pastrana.  After that, he served as ambassador of Colombia in Dominican Republic from 2002 to 2004 and subsequently served as Deputy Minister of Defense for its social and business group for two years from 2009 to 2010 during the presidential term of president Alvaro Uribe.  He was in the Colombian Armed Forces for 41 years, achieving all the military ranks all the way up to his appointment as General Commander for the Colombian Armed Forces. Conscription in the United States, commonly known as the draft, has been employed by the federal government of the United States in four conflicts: the American Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Cold War (including both the Korean and Vietnam Wars).  The third incarnation of the draft came into being in 1940 through the Selective Training and Service Act.  It was the country's first peacetime draft.  From 1940 until 1973, during both peacetime and periods of conflict, men were drafted to fill vacancies in the United States Armed Forces that could not be filled through voluntary means.  The draft was ended when the United States Armed Forces moved to an all-volunteer military force.  However, the Selective Service System remains in place as a contingency plan; all male civilians between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register so that a draft can be readily resumed if needed. The Military Covenant or Armed Forces Covenant is a term introduced in 2000 into British public life to refer to the mutual obligations between the nation and its Armed Forces.  According to The Guardian, it is an informal understanding, rather than a legally enforceable deal, but it is nevertheless treated with great seriousness within the services.  It was coined in , and has now entered political discourse as a way of measuring whether the government and society at large have kept to their obligations to support members of the armed forces. Armed Forces Day, known also as the Feast of the Polish Armed Forces (Polish: Święto Wojska Polskiego ), is a national holiday celebrated annually on 15 August in Poland, commemorating the anniversary of the 1920 victory over Soviet Russia at the Battle of Warsaw during the Polish–Soviet War.  Armed Forces Day is held in conjunction with the Day of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, itself a separate public holiday.  The event is marked by military parades, equipment reviews, showcases and remembrances by all branches of the Polish Armed Forces across the country.  One of the most prominent events of the day is in the capital Warsaw, which hosts a large military parade through the city's center.  Originally celebrated during the Second Republic, the holiday was barred by authorities during the communist era beginning in 1947, only to be revived again in 1992. In June 1941, Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created the Fair Employment Practice Committee (FEPC).  It was the most important federal move in support of the rights of African-Americans between Reconstruction and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The President's order stated that the federal government would not hire any person based on their race, color, creed, or national origin.  The FEPC enforced the order to ban discriminatory hiring within the federal government and in corporations that received federal contracts.  Millions of blacks and women achieved better jobs and better pay as a result.  The war brought the race issue to the forefront.  The Army and Navy had been segregated since the Civil War.  But by 1940, the African-American vote had largely shifted from Republican to Democrat, and African-American leaders like Walter Francis White of the NAACP and T. Arnold Hill of the Urban League had become recognized as part of the Roosevelt coalition.  In June 1941, at the urging of A. Philip Randolph, the leading African-American trade unionist, Roosevelt signed an executive order establishing the Fair Employment Practice Committee and prohibiting discrimination by any government agency, including the armed forces.  In practice the services, particularly the Navy and the Marines, found ways to evade this order — the Marine Corps remained all-white until 1942.  In September 1942, at Eleanor's instigation, Roosevelt met with a delegation of African-American leaders, who demanded full integration into the forces, including the right to serve in combat roles and in the Navy, the Marine Corps and the United States Army Air Forces.  Roosevelt agreed, but then did nothing to implement his promise.  It was left to his successor, Harry S. Truman, to fully desegregate the armed forces. [/INST]

The Supreme Court held in Rostker v. Goldberg (453 U.S. 57, 1981) that the gender distinction was not a violation of the equal protection component of the due process clause, and the Act was upheld as passed.

Centered on the town of El Nacimiento in Múzquiz Municipality, the group are descendants of Black Seminoles escaping the threat of slavery in the United States. Dhoolpet is one of the old suburbs in Hyderabad, India.  It is part of the old city of Hyderabad.  This place is inhabited by people who migrated from Uttar Pradesh during the Nizam rule.  The Nizam helped these people settle in this area.  The area is notorious for bootlegging and has witnessed attacks on policemen or excise department officials during raids. Seminole music is the music of the Seminole people, an indigenous people of the Americas who formed in Florida in the 18th century.  Today most live in Oklahoma, but a minority continue in Florida.  They have three federally recognized tribes, and some people belong to bands outside those groups.  Their traditional music includes extensive use of rattles, hand drums, water drums, and flutes. The Seminole are a Native American people originally from Florida.  Today, they principally live in Oklahoma with a minority in Florida, and comprise three federally recognized tribes: the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma, the Seminole Tribe of Florida, and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, as well as independent groups.  The Seminole nation emerged in a process of ethnogenesis from various Native American groups who settled in Florida in the 18th century, most significantly northern Muscogee (Creeks) from what is now Georgia and Alabama.  The word Seminole is derived from the Creek word simanó-li, which may be itself be derived from the Spanish word cimarrón, menaning runaway or wild one. The history of draining and development of the Everglades dates back to the 19th century.  During the Second Seminole War beginning in 1836, the United States military's mission was to seek out Seminole people in the Everglades and capture or kill them.  Those missions gave the military the opportunity to map land that seemed to frustrate and confound them at every turn.  A national push for expansion and progress toward the latter part of the 19th century stimulated interest in draining the Everglades for agricultural use.  According to historians, From the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, the United States went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned.  Indeed, it was considered the proper thing to do. The Muscogee language (Mvskoke in Muscogee), also known as Creek, Seminole, Maskókî or Muskogee, is a Muskogean language spoken by Muscogee (Creek) and Seminole people, primarily in the U.S. states of Oklahoma and Florida. Seminole County is a county located in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.  As of the 2010 census, the population was 25,482.  Its county seat is Wewoka.  Before Oklahoma's admission as a state, the county was the entire small portion of Indian Territory allocated to the Seminole people, who were removed from Florida in the 1820s. The Battle of Jupiter Inlet occurred on January 15, 1838, between the Seminole Indians - Seminole Negro and the United States Navy.  This was the first of a series of battles led by the US Navy in the area, also referred to as the First Battle of Loxahatchee.  The battle started when Lt. Levin Powell led an expedition of 200 soldiers, sailors and marines, down the east coast of Florida.  The Navy spotted a trail alongside the Jupiter Inlet, and seventy-five men were landed to find the Seminole camp nearby.  The camp was led by Sam Jones, Ar-pi-uck-i, the spiritual medicine and war chief of the Miccosukee and Seminole people during the war.  The officers that advanced on the camp were outnumbered and ambushed.  After a long fight, the US retreated with five men killed in action and about twenty others wounded.  Ltn.  Powell was one of those killed in battle. The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma is a federally recognized Native American tribe based in the U.S. state of Oklahoma.  It is the largest of the three federally recognized Seminole governments, which include the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida.  Its members are descendants of the 3,000 Seminoles who were forcibly removed from Florida to Indian Territory, along with 800 Black Seminoles, after the Second Seminole War.  The Seminole Nation of Oklahoma is headquartered in Wewoka within Seminole County, Oklahoma.  Of 18,800 enrolled tribal members, 13,533 live within the state of Oklahoma.  The tribe began to revive its government in 1936 under the Indian Reorganization Act.  While its reservation was originally larger, today the tribal jurisdictional area covers Seminole County, Oklahoma, within which it has a variety of properties. The Black Seminoles are black Indians associated with the Seminole people in Florida and Oklahoma.  They are the descendants of free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida.  Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole.  Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes, including the right to bear arms.

Led by second-year head coach Bobby Ross, the team played their home games at Bobby Dodd Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, which was renamed after legendary Georgia Tech head coach Bobby Dodd. The Yellow Jackets finished last in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) for the second consecutive season, failing to win a conference game.

The team has a rich history, with the 1959 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team being a notable example.

However, several close losses derailed their season, and they finished with a 6–4 record. They were invited to the Gator Bowl, where they lost to Southwest Conference co-champion Arkansas.

The Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball team has also had success, with Bobby Cremins leading the team to the school's first ACC tournament victory in 1985 and their first Final Four appearance ever in 1990. Under Paul Hewitt, the team returned to the Final Four in 2004 and lost in the national title game to UConn. Overall, the team has won 1,318 games and lost 1,176 games, giving them a .528 win percentage.

Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field has been the home of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team since 1913. It is the oldest stadium in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and has been the site of more home wins than any other FBS stadium. The stadium has a capacity of 55,000 and has undergone several renovations and expansions over the years.

The 1990 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team had an undefeated season, posting a 11–0–1 record. The team's offense scored 379 points while the defense allowed 186 points. Highlights from the season included a nationally televised win over #1 Virginia on the road and a defeat of archrival Georgia for the second consecutive year. The team capped off the season by defeating Nebraska, 45–21, in the Florida Citrus Bowl. Head coach Bobby Ross and the Yellow Jackets were awarded a share of the national championship, winning the UPI Poll title by one vote over Colorado, who won the AP Poll title.

It is a popular children's song in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and Canada, and is often sung by children on bus trips to keep themselves amused.  It has a very repetitive rhythm, making the song easy for a large number of people to sing, in a manner similar to the song 99 Bottles of Beer.  It is based on fellow traditional British song Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush.  The song is also sometimes sung to the tune of Buffalo Gals, as in the version done by Raffi. Roy Holder (born 15 June 1946) is an English television actor who has appeared in various programmes including Ace of Wands, Z-Cars, Spearhead, the Doctor Who serial The Caves of Androzani and Sorry!

The same tune is also used for Lazy Mary, Will You Get Up and a variant is used for The Wheels on the Bus. Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush is a single by Traffic.  It is the title song to the film Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush, and features all four members of Traffic singing a joint lead, though the bridge and parts of the chorus have Steve Winwood singing unaccompanied.  The single uses an edited version of the song, with the intro removed.  When released in late 1967, the single cracked the UK Top 10.  Footage of the band acting out the song was commissioned by The Beatles for possible inclusion in the film Magical Mystery Tour but was not used in the final edit.  It is now included in the special features of the 2012 DVD/Blu-ray edition of the film.

The origin of the words and music is unknown, but the tune bears similarity to Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush.  The earliest documented reference is The Hackney Scout Song Book (Stacy & Son Ltd, 1921).  It also appears in The Oxford song book, vol.2, collected and arranged by Thomas Wood (Oxford University Press, 1927).

Passage: World heavyweight champion. Charles returned to boxing after the war as a light heavyweight, picking up many notable wins over leading light heavyweights, as well as heavyweight contenders Archie Moore, Jimmy Bivins, Lloyd Marshall and Elmer Ray. [/INST] Rephrase paragraph: After serving in World War II, Charles resumed his boxing career in the light heavyweight division. He achieved numerous significant victories against top-ranked light heavyweight boxers, as well as fighters considered contenders in the heavyweight division, such as Archie Moore, Jimmy Bivins, Lloyd Marshall, and Elmer Ray. </s><s>[INST] Passage: Isopropyl alcohol (IUPAC name propan-2-ol), also called dimethyl carbinol or, incorrectly, isopropanol, is a compound with the chemical formula CHO or CHOH or CHCHOHCH (sometimes represented as i-PrOH).  It is a colorless, flammable chemical compound with a strong odor.  As a propyl group linked to a hydroxyl group, it is the simplest example of a secondary alcohol, where the alcohol carbon atom is attached to two other carbon atoms, sometimes shown as (CH)CHOH.  It is a structural isomer of 1-propanol.  It has a wide variety of industrial and household uses, and is a common ingredient in chemicals such as antiseptics, disinfectants and detergents. Alcohol is any organic compound in which a hydroxyl functional group (-OH) is bound to a carbon atom, usually connected to other carbon or hydrogen atoms.  An important class are the simple acyclic alcohols, the general formula for which is CHOH.  Of those, ethanol (CHOH) is the type of alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, and in common speech the word alcohol refers specifically to ethanol.  Articles related to alcohol include: Shellite (known as Tridite in US service) is an explosive mixture of Picric acid and Dinitrophenol or Picric acid and Hexanitrodiphenylamine in a ratio of 70/30.  It was typically used as a filling in Royal Navy armour-piercing shells during the early part of the 20th century. Tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride (THPC) is an organophosphorus compound with the chemical formula [P(CHOH)]Cl.  The cation P(CHOH) is four-coordinate, as is typical for phosphonium salts. THPC has applications as a precursor to fire-retardant materials. 1-Hexanol is an organic alcohol with a six-carbon chain and a condensed structural formula of CH(CH)OH.  This colorless liquid is slightly soluble in water, but miscible with diethyl ether and ethanol.  Two additional straight chain isomers of 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol and 3-hexanol, exist, both of which differing by the location of the hydroxyl group.  Many isomeric alcohols have the formula CHOH.  It is used in the perfume industry. 1-Pentanol, (or n-pentanol, pentan-1-ol), is an alcohol with five carbon atoms and the molecular formula CHOH.  1-Pentanol is a colorless liquid with an unpleasant aroma.  It is the straight-chain form of amyl alcohol, one of 8 isomers with that formula. An aldonic acid is any of a family of sugar acids obtained by oxidation of the aldehyde functional group of an aldose to form a carboxylic acid functional group.  Thus, their general chemical formula is HOOC-(CHOH)-CHOH.  Oxidation of the terminal hydroxyl group instead of the terminal aldehyde yields a uronic acid, while oxidation of both terminal ends yields an aldaric acid. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol used as a sweetener.  The name derives from Greek: ξύλον , xyl[on], wood + suffix -itol, used to denote sugar alcohols.  Xylitol is categorized as a polyalcohol or sugar alcohol (alditol).  It has the formula CHOH(CHOH)CHOH and is an achiral isomer of pentane-1,2,3,4,5-pentol.  Multiple studies using electron microscopy have indicated that xylitol is effective in inducing remineralization of deeper layers of demineralized enamel.  Fair evidence was found that xylitol (as chewing gum, lozenges, nasal spray, etc.) reduced the incidence of acute middle ear infection in healthy children. In a mixture between a dielectric and a metallic component, the conductivity formula_1 and the dielectric constant formula_2 of this mixture show a critical behavior if the fraction of the metallic component reaches the percolation threshold.  The behavior of the conductivity near this percolation threshold will show a smooth change over from the conductivity of the dielectric component to the conductivity of the metallic component and can be described using two critical exponents s and t, whereas the dielectric constant will diverge if the threshold is approached from either side.  To include the frequency dependent behavior, a resistor-capacitor model (R-C model) is used. Picric acid is an organic compound with the formula (ON)CHOH.  Its IUPAC name is 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP).  The name picric comes from the Greek πικρός (pikros), meaning bitter, reflecting its bitter taste.  It is one of the most acidic phenols.  Like other highly nitrated organic compounds, picric acid is an explosive, which was once its primary use.  It has also been used in medicine (antiseptic, burn treatments) and dyes. [/INST]

The Water Trail is enhancing Bay Area communities’ connections to the Bay and creating new linkages to existing shoreline open spaces and other regional trails as well as increasing education about personal safety, navigational safety, and appropriate boating behavior near sensitive wildlife species and shoreline habitat.  The Water Trail is implemented under the leadership of the California Coastal Conservancy in close collaboration with the Association of Bay Area Governments, the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission, and the California Department of Boating and Waterways. Old and in the Way is the self-titled first album by the bluegrass band Old and in the Way.  It was recorded 8 October 1973 at the Boarding House in San Francisco by Owsley Stanley and Vickie Babcock utilizing eight microphones (four per channel) mixed live onto a stereo Nagra tape recorder.

The Key System consisted of local streetcar and bus lines in the East Bay, and commuter rail and bus lines connecting the East Bay to San Francisco by a ferry pier on San Francisco Bay, later via the lower deck of the Bay Bridge.  At its height during the 1940s, the Key System had over 66 mi of track.  The local streetcars were discontinued in 1948 and the commuter trains to San Francisco were discontinued in 1958.  The Key System's territory is today served by BART and AC Transit bus service.

He was Senior Producer of the TV game show Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?  He produced Zoom (1999) and The Wubbulous World of Dr. Seuss.  He co-founded a production company called Andanzura.  In addition, he is notable for having a dual career as a professional Santa Claus.  He made numerous appearances in various media as Santa, including ABC's Good Morning America show, and at New York's Radio City Music Hall with The Rockettes.

The pre-1974 library is owned by Universal Studios (via DreamWorks Animation/DreamWorks Classics), while the post-1973 library is owned by Warner Bros. Rankin/Bass stop-motion features are recognisable by their visual style of doll-like characters with spheroid body parts, and ubiquitous powdery snow using an animation technique called Animagic.  Often, traditional cel animation scenes of falling snow would be projected over the action to create the effect of a snowfall. Santa Claus: The Movie (known on-screen as simply Santa Claus) is a 1985 British-American Christmas film starring Dudley Moore, John Lithgow, and David Huddleston in the title role.

The Year Without a Santa Claus is a 1974 Christmas stop motion animated television special produced by Rankin/Bass Productions.

A Miser Brothers' Christmas is a stop motion spin-off special based on some of the characters from the 1974 Rankin-Bass special The Year Without a Santa Claus.  Distributed by Warner Bros.

Mickey Rooney and George S. Irving reprised their respective roles as Santa Claus and Heat Miser at ages 88 and 86.  Snow Miser, originally portrayed by Dick Shawn who died in 1987, was voiced by Juan Chioran, while Mrs. Claus, voiced by Shirley Booth in the original, was portrayed by Catherine Disher (because Booth had died in 1992).  The movie aimed to emulate the Rankin/Bass animation style.  This is the last Christmas special to feature Mickey Rooney as Santa Claus, as he died in 2014, as well as the last time George Irving voiced Heat Miser, as he died in 2016. Motion pictures featuring Santa Claus abound and apparently constitute their own subgenre of the Christmas film genre.  Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children.  In 1897, in a short film called Santa Claus Filling Stockings, Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys.  Another film called Santa Claus and the Children was made in 1898.  A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith in titled Santa Claus (or The Visit from Santa Claus in the United Kingdom) was created.  In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree.  He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children.  After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney.  Santa Claus' Visit in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers.  The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room.  Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children.  He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace.  He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts.  The scene closes with the children waking up and running to the fireplace just too late to catch him by the legs.  A 1909 film by D. W. Griffith titled A Trap for Santa Claus shows children setting a trap to capture Santa Claus as he descends the chimney, but instead capture their father who abandoned them and their mother but tries to burglarize the house after he discovers she inherited a fortune.  A twenty-nine-minute 1925 silent film production titled Santa Claus, by explorer/documentarian Frank E. Kleinschmidt, filmed partly in northern Alaska, feature Santa in his workshop, visiting his Eskimo neighbors, and tending his reindeer.  A year later, another movie titled Santa Claus was produced with sound on De Forest Phonofilm.  Over the years, various actors have donned the red suit (aside from those discussed below), including Monty Woolley in Life Begins at Eight-thirty (1942), Alberto Rabagliati in The Christmas That Almost Wasn't (1966), Dan Aykroyd in Trading Places (1983), Jan Rubes in One Magic Christmas (1985), David Huddleston in  (1985), Jonathan Taylor Thomas in I'll Be Home for Christmas (1998), and Ed Asner in Elf (2003).  Later films about Santa vary, but can be divided into the following themes. The Year Without a Santa Claus is a 90-minute 2006 live-action remake of the Rankin-Bass classic The Year Without a Santa Claus which premiered on NBC December 11, 2006.  A widescreen DVD was released on December 12, 2006 (UPC 085391115120). [/INST]

Truth Initiative (formerly the American Legacy Foundation or Legacy) is a nonprofit tobacco control organization dedicated to achieving a culture where all youth and young adults reject tobacco.  It was established in March 1999 as a result of the Master Settlement Agreement between the attorneys general of 46 states, the District of Columbia and five United States territories, and the tobacco industry.  Truth Initiative is best known for its youth smoking prevention campaign.  Its other primary aims include conducting tobacco control research and policy studies, organizing community and youth engagement programs and developing digital cessation and prevention products, including through revenue-generating models.  The organization changed its name from the American Legacy Foundation to Truth Initiative on September 8, 2015, to better align with its Truth campaign.  As of 2016, the organization had more than $957 million in assets and a staff of 133 based primarily in its Washington, D.C. office. Extrema formed in 1986 in Milan.  The initial lineup included guitarist Tommy Massara, vocalist/guitarist Andrea Boria, bassist Luca Varisco, and drummer Stefano Bullegas.  Regarded as one of Italy's first thrash metal bands, Extrema's first EP, We F**kin' Care (1987), sold an impressive 3,000 copies by word of mouth alone.  Italian heavy metal fans didn't yet seem prepared to embrace local talent, however, and the next four years saw Extrema (by then entirely re-vamped, with Massara signing on new members Gianluca Perotti on vocals, Mattia Bigi on bass, and Chris Dalla Pellegrina on drums) relegated to open for visiting acts like Slayer, D.R.I., and Corrosion of Conformity.  Finally realizing that their only hope of impressing local talent scouts lay in conquering from the outside-in, Extrema started aggressively shopping their demos to international heavy metal critics, and even financed a trip to New York City for a one-off gig.  The strategy worked, and their four-track demo from 1991 was soon making waves with some major international publications, eventually leading to a record deal with Contempo Records.  The result was the 1993's Tension at the Seams album, which led to stadium support slots with Italian rock star Vasco Rossi, and more importantly a high-profile metal festival appearance in Turin alongside Megadeth, The Cult, Suicidal Tendencies, and Metallica.  The album also featured an unconventional cover of The Police's Truth Hits Everybody and spawned a video clip for the track Child O' Boogaow which was on heavy rotation on Italy's MTV affiliate, Videomusic.

But Brody has his own problems trying to hold a dying town together.  Miracle after miracle takes place and the residents of Promise embrace the boy.  But when the beloved town doctor dies, it is time for the truth to be revealed.  The boy pleads with Brody in front of the whole town to believe that he's come to help, not to hurt anyone.

The main attraction of the whole memorial is the Sandstone wall, in the open, which has the names of all the Indian army personnel, who laid their lives during the Kargil war besides there is also a souvenir shop.  Visitors to the memorial can also see from there, some of the peaks that the Indian army captured back from Pakistan.  A giant national flag, weighing 15 kg was hoisted at the Kargil war memorial to commemorate the 13th anniversary of India’s victory in the war The Devon County War Memorial is a First World War memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and situated on the cathedral green in Exeter, the county town of Devon, in the south west of England.  It is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Lutyens to a similar specification, and one of two to serve as a civic memorial in a city.  The first proposal for the county's war memorial was to complete the construction of a cloister at Exeter Cathedral to be dedicated to the Devon's war dead, but this scheme was abandoned due to lack of funds.  After considering multiple proposals, the Devon County War Memorial Committee commissioned Lutyens to design a War Cross instead.  The committee chose to site the memorial on the green of Exeter Cathedral after scouting several locations.  A war memorial for Exeter itself was being considered concurrently, but the committees for the two projects failed to work together, resulting in two separate memorials—the county memorial by the cathedral and Exeter City War Memorial in Northernhay Gardens. Manchester Cenotaph is a First World War memorial, with additions for later conflicts, by Sir Edwin Lutyens in St Peter's Square in Manchester, England.  Manchester was late in commissioning a war memorial compared to most British towns and cities—the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922.  The committee quickly raised £10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial.  The preferred site in Albert Square, requiring the removal and relocation of several statues, was opposed by the city's artistic community.  The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area ripe for development, but in the interests of expediency, the council chose St Peter's Square, although it already contained a memorial cross to the former St Peter's Church.  Negotiations to move the cross were unsuccessful and the war memorial was built with the cross in situ. The York City War Memorial is a First World War memorial designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens and located in York in the north of England.  Proposals for commemorating York's war dead originated in 1919 but proved controversial.  Initial discussions focused on whether a memorial should be a monument or should take on some utilitarian purpose.  Several functional proposals were examined until a public meeting in January 1920 opted for a monument.  The city engineer produced a cost estimate and the war memorial committee engaged Lutyens, who had recently been commissioned by the North Eastern Railway (NER) to design their own war memorial, also to be sited in York.  Lutyens' first design was approved, but controversy enveloped proposals for both the city's and the NER's memorials.  Members of the local community became concerned that the memorials as planned were not in keeping with York's existing architecture, especially as both were in close proximity to the ancient city walls, and that the NER's memorial would overshadow the city's.  Continued public opposition forced the committee to abandon the proposed site in favour of one on Leeman Road, just outside the walls, and Lutyens submitted a new design of a War Cross and Stone of Remembrance to fit the location.  This was scaled back to the cross alone due to lack of funds. The Maiwand Lion is a sculpture and war memorial in the Forbury Gardens, a public park in the town of Reading, in the English county of Berkshire.  The statue was named after the Battle of Maiwand and was erected in 1884 to commemorate the deaths of 329 men from the 66th (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot during the campaign in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in Afghanistan between 1878 and 1880.  It is sometimes known locally as the Forbury Lion. The Reading Post (until 2009, the Reading Evening Post), was an English local newspaper covering Reading, Berkshire and surrounding areas.  The title page of the paper featured the Maiwand Lion, a famous local landmark at Forbury Gardens.  The paper was most recently published by Surrey & Berkshire Media Ltd., a division of Trinity Mirror plc. Spalding War Memorial is a First World War memorial in the gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall (pronounced ) in Spalding, Lincolnshire, in eastern England.  It was designed by the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens.  The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war.  She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross.  The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council.  When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested.  After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building. The Forbury Hotel (formerly Shire Hall) is a grade II listed hotel in the town of Reading in the English county of Berkshire.

The Kingdom of the Isles, which encompassed the Hebrides, the islands of the Firth of Clyde, and the Isle of Man, existed from the 9th to the 13th centuries AD. During this time, the islands were known as the Suðreyjar, or Southern Isles, and were distinct from the Norðreyjar, or Northern Isles, of Orkney and Shetland. The historical record is incomplete, and the kingdom was not a continuous entity throughout the period. The rulers of the islands were sometimes independent of external control, but for much of the time, they had overlords in Norway, Ireland, England, Scotland, or Orkney. There were also competing claims for all or parts of the territory, which comprised over 8300 km2 of land and extended for more than 500 km from north to south.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.  Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways.  In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as Beatlemania, and as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. Marsha Albert (born 1948) is credited with being the person who jump-started the early 1960s phenomena known as Beatlemania in the United States when as a 15-year-old girl, on 17 December 1963, she introduced for the first time on American radio a song written and recorded by The Beatles titled I Want to Hold Your Hand (the Beatles' best-selling single worldwide), and that Beatles historian and author Bruce Spizer noted, in 2004, by his stating Marsha Albert's actions forced a major record company to push up the release date of a debut single from an unknown band during the holiday season, a time when record companies traditionally released no new product. Cargo Records was a Canadian independent record label and distributor, active in the 1980s and 1990s.  Based in Montreal, the company both released albums directly as a label, and distributed albums on behalf of many other small independent labels, making it one of the largest and most influential Canadian record companies of the alternative rock era. Azra was a rock band that was popular across Yugoslavia in the 1980s.  Azra was formed in 1977 by its frontman Branimir Johnny Štulić.  The other two members of the original line-up were Mišo Hrnjak (bass) and Boris Leiner (drums).  The band is named after a verse from Der Asra by Heinrich Heine.  They are considered to be one of the most influential bands from the former Yugoslav new wave rock era and the Yugoslav rock scene in general. The Beach Boys are an American rock band formed in Hawthorne, California, in 1961.  The group's original lineup consisted of brothers Brian, Dennis, and Carl Wilson; their cousin Mike Love; and their friend Al Jardine.  Distinguished by their vocal harmonies and early surf songs, they are one of the most influential acts of the rock era.  The group, led by their principal songwriter and producer Brian, pioneered novel approaches to popular music form and production, combining their affinities for jazz-based vocal groups, 1950s rock and roll, and black R&B to create their unique sound.  He later arranged his compositions for studio orchestras and explored a variety of other styles, often incorporating classical or jazz elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. Christian Death is an American deathrock band formed in Los Angeles, California, in 1979 by Rozz Williams.  They became a highly influential act, heralding the American gothic rock and deathrock movements. The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960.

Adam and the Ants were an English rock band active during the late 1970s and early 1980s.  The group, which lasted from 1977 to 1982, existed in two incarnations, both fronted by Adam Ant.  The first, founded in May 1977 and known simply as The Ants until November that year, achieved considerable cult popularity during the transition from the punk rock era to the post-punk and new wave era and were noted for their high camp and overtly sexualised stage performances and songs.  The final line-up of this first incarnation – Dave Barbarossa, Matthew Ashman and Leigh Gorman – left the band in January 1980 at the suggestion of then-de facto manager Malcolm McLaren, to form the instrumentalist personnel of the controversial Bow Wow Wow. David Bruce Spizer (born July 2, 1955) is a tax attorney in New Orleans, Louisiana, who is also recognized as an expert on The Beatles.  He has published eight books, and is frequently quoted as an authority on the history of the band and its recordings. Elvis Presley has inspired artistic and cultural works since he entered the national consciousness.  From that point, interest in his personal and public life has never stopped.

Its output is 6 to 10 candela, brighter than that of earlier lamps.  Its more complete combustion of the candle wick and oil than in other lamps required much less frequent trimming of the wick. A hollow-cathode lamp (HCL) is type of cold cathode lamp used in physics and chemistry as a spectral line source (e.g. for atomic absorption spectrometers) and as a frequency tuner for light sources such as lasers.  An HCL takes advantage of the hollow cathode effect, which causes conduction at a lower voltage and with more current than a cold cathode lamp that does not have a hollow cathode. Antoine Quinquet was a French pharmacist who was born in Soissons on 9 March 1745.  In 1760 he was apprenticed to an apothecary in Soissons and in 1777 he moved to Paris where he worked for Antoine Baumé.  He travelled to Geneva, where he met Aimé Argand.  In 1779, he returned to Paris and opened his own pharmacy there. A kerosene lamp (usually called a paraffin lamp in some countries) is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene (paraffin) as a fuel.  Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting.  Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats.  There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat wick, central draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp.  Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead flame, hot blast, and cold blast variants. A glow switch starter is a type of preheat starter used with fluorescent lamp.  It is commonly filled with neon gas or argon gas and contains a bimetallic strip and a stationary electrode.  The operating principle is simple, when current is applied, the gas inside ionizes and heats a bimetallic strip which in turn bends toward the stationary electrode thus shorting the starter between the electrodes of the fluorescent lamp After a second the starter's bimetallic strip will cool and open the circuit between the electrodes and the process repeats until the lamp has lit.  One disadvantage of glow switch starters is that when the lamp is at the end of its life it will continuously blink on and off until the glow switch starter wears out or an electrode on the fluorescent lamp burns out. The qulliq (seal-oil, blubber or soapstone lamp, Inuktitut: ᖁᓪᓕᖅ , ‘kudlik’ ] ; Inupiaq: naniq ), is the traditional oil lamp used by Arctic peoples, including the Inuit, the Chukchi and the Yupik peoples. A trouble light, also known as a rough service light, drop light, or inspection lamp, is a special lamp used to illuminate obscure places and able to handle moderate abuse.  The light bulb is housed in a protective cage and a handle that are molded to form a single unit.  It has a long power line for distant reaching; the handle may also have electrical outlet on it, allowing the light to also double as an extension cord. The Lewis lamp is a type of light fixture used in lighthouses.  It was invented by Winslow Lewis who patented the design in 1810.  The primary marketing point of the Lewis lamp was that it used less than half the oil of the prior oil lamps which they replaced.  The lamp used a similar design to an Argand lamp, adding a parabolic reflector behind the lamp and a magnifying lens made from 4 in green bottle glass in front of the lamp.  A similar variant using a parabolic reflector was created by the inventor of the Argand lamp, Aimé Argand.  While the Argand variant became widely used by European lighthouses, the Lewis lamp design was selected by the United States for use in American lighthouses. The Hefner lamp, or in German Hefnerkerze, is a flame lamp used in photometry that burns amyl acetate. The carbon button lamp is a single-electrode incandescent lamp invented by Nikola Tesla.  A carbon button lamp contains a small carbon sphere positioned in the center of an evacuated glass bulb.  This type of lamp must be driven by high-frequency alternating current, and depends on an electric arc or perhaps a vacuum arc to produce high current around the carbon electrode.  The carbon electrode is then heated to incandescence by collisions by ions which constitute the electric current.  Tesla found that these lamps could be used as powerful sources of ionizing radiation. [/INST]

The genus is abbreviated Bro in trade journals. William Henry Nicholls (23 July 1885 – 10 March 1951) was an Australian amateur botanist, authority on, and collector of Australian orchids.  An accomplished photographer and watercolourist, he contributed almost 100 articles on orchids to The Victorian Naturalist, many of which described new species with line drawings.  He was working on producing a 24-volume illustrated monograph of all the orchids of Australia when he died.  Only four volumes were published shortly after his death but the entire work was published in a single book, Orchids of Australia in 1969.  Some of the many orchids described and named by Nicholls and retaining the name he gave them include Caladenia caudata, Caladenia echidnachila, Caladenia ensata, Caladenia ferruginea, Caladenia magniclavata, Caladenia ornata, Caladenia praecox, Caladenia radiata, Pterostylis fischii, Pterostylis hamiltonii, Pterostylis hildii and Pterostylis tenuissima. Otaara, abbreviated Otr.  in the horticultural trade, is an intergeneric hybrid of orchids, with Brassavola, Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia and Sophronitis as parent genera. Paracaleana commonly known as duck orchids, is a genus of flowering plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae that is found in Australia and New Zealand.  The Australian species are found in all states but have not been recorded in the Northern Territory.  Orchids in this genus are similar to Caleana major, but there are differences in the flowers and in the insects that pollinate them.  Paraceleana orchids, as well as hammer orchids (Drakaea) are pollinated by male thynnid wasps.  Duck orchids have a single leaf and one or a few, dull-coloured, inconspicuous flowers. Laeliocattleya is a nothogenus of intergeneric orchid hybrids descended from the parental genera Laelia and Cattleya.  It is abbreviated Lc.  in the horticultural trade. Caladenia, commonly known as spider orchids, is a genus of 350 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Spider orchids are terrestrial herbs with a single hairy leaf and a hairy stem.  The labellum is fringed or toothed in most species and there are small projections called calli on the labellum.  The flowers have adaptations to attract particular species of insects for pollination.  The genus is divided into three groups on the basis of flower shape, broadly, spider orchids, zebra orchids and cowslip orchids, although other common names are often used.  Although they occur in other countries, most are Australian and 136 species occur in Western Australia, making it the most species-rich orchid genus in that state. Broughtonia is a genus of orchids (family Orchidaceae) native to the Bahamas and the Greater Antilles.  The genus is abbreviated Bro in trade journals. Calochilus, commonly known as beard orchids, is a genus of about 30 species of plants in the orchid family, Orchidaceae.  Beard orchids are terrestrial, herbs with a single leaf at the base of the plant, or no leaves.  Their most striking feature is a densely hairy labellum, giving rise to their common name.  Beard orchids, unlike some other Australian orchids, do not reproduce using daughter tubers, but self-pollinate when cross-pollination has not occurred.  Most species occur in Australia but some are found in New Zealand, New Guinea and New Caledonia. Cattleytonia (from Cattleya and Broughtonia, its parental genera) is an intergeneric hybrid of orchids.  It is abbreviated Ctna in horticultural trade. Hawkinsara, abbreviated Hknsa.  in the horticultural trade, is an intergeneric hybrid of orchids, with parent genera Broughtonia, Cattleya, Laelia and Sophronitis. [/INST]

The Battle of Manila (February 3, 1945 – March 3, 1945) was a major battle of the Philippine campaign of 1944-45, during the Second World War.  It was fought by American and Filipino forces against Japanese troops in Manila, the capital city of the Philippines.  The month-long battle, which resulted in the death of over 100,000 civilians and the complete devastation of the city, was the scene of the worst urban fighting in the Pacific theater.  Japanese forces committed mass murder against Filipino civilians during the battle.  Along with massive loss of life, the battle also destroyed architectural and cultural heritage dating back to the city's foundation.  The battle ended the almost three years of Japanese military occupation in the Philippines (1942–1945).  The city's capture was marked as General Douglas MacArthur's key to victory in the campaign of reconquest.

The Battle of Cross Keys was fought on June 8, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, as part of Confederate Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.  Together, the battles of Cross Keys and Port Republic the following day were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia. The Battle of Gaines's Mill, sometimes known as the First Battle of Cold Harbor or the Battle of Chickahominy River, took place on June 27, 1862, in Hanover County, Virginia, as the third of the Seven Days Battles (Peninsula Campaign) of the American Civil War.  Following the inconclusive Battle of Beaver Dam Creek (Mechanicsville) the previous day, Confederate General Robert E. Lee renewed his attacks against the right flank of the Union Army, relatively isolated on the northern side of the Chickahominy River.  There, Brig. Gen. Fitz John Porter's V Corps had established a strong defensive line behind Boatswain's Swamp.  Lee's force was destined to launch the largest Confederate attack of the war, about 57,000 men in six divisions.  Porter's reinforced V Corps held fast for the afternoon as the Confederates attacked in a disjointed manner, first with the division of Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill, then Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell, suffering heavy casualties.  The arrival of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's command was delayed, preventing the full concentration of Confederate force before Porter received some reinforcements from the VI Corps. Savage's Station was the wartime name of a supply depot, ammunition dump, field hospital, and command headquarters of the Army of the Potomac during the Peninsula Campaign of the American Civil War.  Savage's Station was located in Henrico County, Virginia on what was the Richmond and York River Railroad, however the historical department of the Norfolk Southern Railroad, the railroad track's current owner, has no record that an actual train station or station house ever existed on the property.  A farmhouse is known to have been located in a copse of trees on a small knoll next to the railroad track and is visible in several period drawings and photographs made during the war.  The house served as the nucleus of a large field hospital during and after the battle of Seven Pines and the Seven Days Battles.  The house also functioned as General George B. McClellan's headquarters during the battle of Savage's Station on June 29, 1862.  Although the house survived the battle in 1862, it was burned by Federal cavalry under General Philip H. Sheridan in 1864.  The house appears to have never been rebuilt, and no trace of it remains today.  However, a smokehouse from the 19th century still existed on the property as late as the 1930s when it was photographed during a survey of local historical structures as a project of the Civilian Conservation Corps.  The smokehouse fell into ruin and collapsed sometime prior to the 1980s.  A small brick-walled cemetery from the 18th century still sits near the former location of the house not far from the railroad track. The Battle of Port Republic was fought on June 9, 1862, in Rockingham County, Virginia, as part of Confederate Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. Stonewall Jackson's campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War.  Port Republic was a fierce contest between two equally determined foes and was the most costly battle fought by Jackson's Army of the Valley during its campaign.  Together, the battles of Cross Keys (fought the previous day) and Port Republic were the decisive victories in Jackson's Valley Campaign, forcing the Union armies to retreat and leaving Jackson free to reinforce Gen. Robert E. Lee for the Seven Days Battles outside Richmond, Virginia. The Seven Days Battles were a series of six major battles over the seven days from June 25 to July 1, 1862, near Richmond, Virginia, during the American Civil War.  Confederate General Robert E. Lee drove the invading Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, away from Richmond and into a retreat down the Virginia Peninsula.  The series of battles is sometimes known erroneously as the Seven Days Campaign, but it was actually the culmination of the Peninsula Campaign, not a separate campaign in its own right. The Northern Virginia Campaign, also known as the Second Bull Run Campaign or Second Manassas Campaign, was a series of battles fought in Virginia during August and September 1862 in the Eastern Theater of the American Civil War.  Confederate General Robert E. Lee followed up his successes of the Seven Days Battles in the Peninsula Campaign by moving north toward Washington, D.C., and defeating Maj. Gen. John Pope and his Army of Virginia. The Battle of Malvern Hill, also known as the Battle of Poindexter's Farm, was fought on July 1, 1862 between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by Gen. Robert E. Lee, and the Union Army of the Potomac under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan.  It was the final battle of the Seven Days Battles during the American Civil War, taking place on a 130 ft elevation of land known as Malvern Hill, near the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia and just one mile (1.6 km) from the James River.  Including inactive reserves, more than fifty thousand soldiers from each side took part, using more than two hundred pieces of artillery and three warships. [/INST]

Maxine's Tap Room is a historic bar in Fayetteville, Arkansas, located on 107 N. Block Ave. It is one of the oldest bars in Northwest Arkansas.  Marjorie Maxine Miller opened the bar in 1950 when she was 24 years old with money she borrowed from her parents.  She managed to pay her parents back within the year.  In 1960 she tore down the old wooden building in which the bar had been located and had the current building—a long, narrow brick structure—built in its place.  The new building had only one window, exactly 8.5 in by 40 in , in the front, which was the minimum size allowed by the building codes at the time.  This was more than likely a business decision aimed at limiting break-ins.  Other examples of Miller's shrewd business style include keeping a club behind the bar, having only a pay phone available, and trying to hire football players as employees so the team would follow as patrons, a business style that led to the bar's longevity and success.  Adding to the Tap Room's charm were a 50 ft -long bar that stretched nearly the entire length of the building and dominated the room, an old coin-operated cigarette machine, a juke box that still played 45s, and a deer head adorned with Mardi Gras beads, sunglasses and a tie.  Miller was a constant figure behind the cash register for 50 years until her health started to decline around 2000.  She died at age 82 in May 2006.  A month later the Tap Room caught fire.  Due to lack of insurance the bar was closed for over a year, reopening in August 2007.  Most of the furniture inside the bar was replaced, including the bar.  The exposed rafters darkened by the fire were simply painted black, and a skylight was installed where the roof had burned through.  Considerable efforts were made to retain many things that had been in the bar for a very long time, such as the older lights and signs. [/INST]

The remains, NMMNH P-18400, consist of a tibia, vertebrae, and fragments, and came from the ? late Carnian-age Upper Triassic Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation, near Fort Wingate.  Andrew Heckert, in his unpublished thesis, proposed the name Cinizasaurus hunti for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauriformes. Sphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada.  To date, three species have been described: the type species, S. goodwini, from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; S. buchholtzae, from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and S. edmontonense, from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada.  The etymology of Sphaerotholus is a combination of the Greek sphaira, meaning ball, and tholos, meaning dome, and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull.  The survival of Sphaerotholus from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8 million years) and a widespread distribution.  Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node.  Sphaerotholus is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur. Oryctodromeus (meaning digging runner) was a genus of small ornithopod dinosaur.  Fossils are known from the middle Cretaceous Blackleaf Formation of southwestern Montana and the Wayan Formation of southeastern Idaho, USA, both of the Cenomanian stage, roughly 95 million years ago.  A member of the small, presumably fast-running herbivorous family Thescelosauridae, Oryctodromeus is the first dinosaur published that shows evidence of burrowing behavior. Cryptoraptor (meaning secret thief) is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a dinosaur.  The remains, NMMNH P-17375, consist of a fragmentary skeleton including vertebrae, a pubis, and parts of the thigh bones.  This specimen came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation in Quay County.  Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name Cryptoraptor lockleyi for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauria. Comanchesaurus is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a theropod dinosaur.  The remains, NMMNH P-4569, consist of a partial skeleton including vertebral centra and hindlimb bones, and came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation of Guadalupe County.  Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name Comanchesaurus kuesi for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007).  In the redescription, the authors found the material to belong to a possible indeterminate saurischian. McFarland, USA (also known as McFarland) is a 2015 American sports drama film directed by Niki Caro, produced by Mark Ciardi and Gordon Gray, written by Christopher Cleveland, Bettina Gilois and Grant Thompson with music composed by Antônio Pinto.

Dinosaur is a 2000 American CGI animated adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and The Secret Lab and released by Walt Disney Pictures.  It is the 39th Disney animated feature film and Disney's The Secret Lab computer animated feature, though it is not officially labeled as one of the animated classics in the United Kingdom, where The Wild (2006) is included in the canon instead. Fruitadens is a genus of heterodontosaurid dinosaur.  The name means Fruita tooth, in reference to Fruita, Colorado (USA), where its fossils were first found.  It is known from partial skulls and skeletons from at least four individuals of differing biological ages, found in Tithonian (Late Jurassic) rocks of the Morrison Formation in Colorado.  Fruitadens is the smallest known ornithischian dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to in length and 0.5 to in weight.  It is interpreted as an omnivore and represents one of the latest-surviving heterodontosaurids. Dakotadon is a genus of iguanodont dinosaur from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota, USA, known from a partial skull.  It was first described in 1989 as Iguanodon lakotaensis, by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork.  Its assignment has been controversial.  Some researchers suggest that I. lakotaensis was more basal than I. bernissartensis, and related to Theiophytalia, but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of I. bernissartensis.  Gregory S. Paul, working on a revision of iguanodont species, gave I. lakotaensis its own genus (Dakotadon) in 2008. [/INST]

The winner was the Dark horse candidate Jimmy Carter, a former Governor from Georgia with his running mate, Walter Mondale, a U.S. Senator from Minnesota, the Democratic candidates, over the incumbent President Gerald Ford from Michigan and his running mate, Bob Dole, a U.S. Senator from Kansas, the Republican candidates. The United States presidential election of 2016 was the 58th quadrennial American presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 2016.  In a surprise victory, the Republican ticket of businessman Donald Trump and Indiana Governor Mike Pence defeated the Democratic ticket of former First Lady, U.S. Senator of New York and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Senator from Virginia Tim Kaine.  Trump took office as the 45th President, and Pence as the 48th Vice President, on January 20, 2017.  Concurrent with the presidential election, Senate, House, and many gubernatorial and state and local elections were also held on November 8. The United States presidential election of 2012 was the 57th quadrennial American presidential election.  It was held on Tuesday, November 6, 2012.  The Democratic nominee, incumbent President Barack Obama, and his running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, were elected to a second term, defeating the Republican nominee, former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney and his running mate, Representative and future House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. The United States presidential election of 2044, scheduled for Tuesday, November 8, 2044, will be the 65th quadrennial U.S. presidential election.  Voters will select presidential electors who in turn will either elect a new president and vice president through the electoral college or re-elect the incumbents.  The series of presidential primary elections and caucuses are likely to be held during the first six months of 2044.  This nominating process is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention, who then in turn elect their party's presidential nominee. The 2016 Michigan Democratic primary took place on March 8 in the U.S. state of Michigan as one of the Democratic Party's primaries ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The United States presidential election of 2020, scheduled for Tuesday, November 3, 2020, will be the 59th quadrennial U.S. presidential election.  Voters will select presidential electors who in turn will either elect a new president and vice president through the electoral college or re-elect the incumbents.  The series of presidential primary elections and caucuses are likely to be held during the first six months of 2020.  This nominating process is also an indirect election, where voters cast ballots selecting a slate of delegates to a political party's nominating convention, who then in turn elect their party's presidential nominee. The United States presidential election of 1968 was the 46th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 5, 1968.  The Republican nominee, former Vice President Richard Nixon, won the election over the Democratic nominee, incumbent Vice President Hubert Humphrey.  Analysts have argued the election of 1968 was a major realigning election as it permanently disrupted the New Deal Coalition that had dominated presidential politics for 36 years. The United States presidential election of 1960 was the 44th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 1960.  The Republican Party nominated incumbent Vice President Richard Nixon, while the Democratic Party nominated John F. Kennedy, U.S. Senator from Massachusetts.  The incumbent President, Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, was not eligible for re-election after being elected the maximum two times allowed by the Twenty-second Amendment; he was the first President denied the choice to run for a third term by that amendment.  This was the first presidential election in which residents in Alaska and Hawaii were able to participate, as both had become states in 1959. The United States presidential election of 1964 was the 45th quadrennial presidential election.  It was held on Tuesday, November 3, 1964.  Democratic candidate and incumbent President Lyndon B. Johnson had come to office less than a year earlier following the assassination of his predecessor John F. Kennedy.  Johnson, who had successfully associated himself with Kennedy’s popularity, won 61.1% of the popular vote, the highest win by a candidate since James Monroe’s re-election in 1820.  It was the most lopsided US presidential election in terms of popular votes, and the tenth-most lopsided presidential election in the history of the United States in terms of electoral votes.  No candidate for president since has equalled or surpassed Johnson’s percentage of the popular vote, and since 1820, only Abraham Lincoln in 1864, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 have won by a greater electoral vote margin. The United States presidential election of 1892 was the 27th quadrennial presidential election, held on Tuesday, November 8, 1892.  It witnessed a re-match of the closely contested presidential election in 1888.  Former Democratic President Grover Cleveland and incumbent Republican President Benjamin Harrison both ran for election to a second term.  In 1888, Cleveland won the popular vote over Harrison, but lost in the electoral college.  In a re-match, Cleveland won both the popular and electoral vote, thus becoming the first and to date only person in American history to be elected to a second, non-consecutive presidential term.  The new Populist Party, formed by groups from The Grange, the Farmers' Alliances, and the Knights of Labor, also fielded a ticket; they polled best in the West, winning in five states and taking a total of 22 electoral votes.

The United States has held presidential elections every four years since 1789. These elections determine the leader of the executive branch of the federal government, as well as the political direction of the country. The election process typically involves a series of primary elections and caucuses, where candidates from various political parties compete for delegates to their party's national convention. At the convention, the party nominates its candidate for president and vice president. The general election is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, and voters cast ballots for their preferred candidate. The candidate who receives the most electoral votes, which are allocated based on the population of each state, wins the presidency.

Here's a list of the presidential elections mentioned in the original passage, along with the winners and the party they represented:

* 1976: Jimmy Carter (Democratic)
* 2016: Donald Trump (Republican)
* 2020: To be determined (election will be held on November 3, 2020)
* 1968: Richard Nixon (Republican)

The culture of Romano-Britain emerged in the UK after the Roman Empire's conquest in AD 43, blending Roman and native Celtic influences. This fusion endured even after the Roman withdrawal in the 5th century. The history of Wales can be traced back to prehistoric times, with evidence of human habitation dating back to around 9000 BC. The Brittonic language and culture persisted in the region until the Anglo-Saxon invasion, which led to the splintering of the language and the development of distinct groups, including the Welsh people. Prior to the Roman conquest, Celtic tribes such as the Durotriges and Corieltauvi inhabited Britain, with their territories stretching across modern-day Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, and Devon. The Roman conquest of Britain began in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, with Aulus Plautius serving as the first governor of Roman Britain. The Roman occupation of Britain lasted until the early 5th century, during which time the region was influenced by Roman culture and trade. The Sussex chicken, a popular garden chicken breed, originated in England around the time of the Roman conquest. Human habitation in England dates back to over 800,000 years ago, with evidence of early modern humans found in Devon and Norfolk. Continuous human habitation in the region can be traced back to around 13,000 years ago, with remains from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age found throughout the region.

response:    Here is the rephrased passage with the requested changes:

Passage: A multi-sport athlete is an athlete who competes at a high level in two or more different sports. Randall Cunningham, a former American football quarterback, is an example of a multi-sport athlete. His son, Randall Cunningham II, is a high jumper and quarterback who attended Bishop Gorman High School. Other notable athletes include Vashti Cunningham, a high jumper and the daughter of Randall Cunningham, and Kenny Rose, a former professional American football linebacker who played for the New York Jets, Cleveland Browns, and Philadelphia Eagles.

College athletes who participate in multiple sports are not uncommon. For example, Randall Cunningham II played both high jump and quarterback at Bishop Gorman High School. Similarly, Vashti Cunningham, the daughter of Randall Cunningham, is a high jumper who attended Bishop Gorman High School and will continue her education at a university while competing as a professional athlete.

Randall Cunningham II's achievements in high jump and football are impressive. He is a five-time Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association (NIAA) state champion in both sports, and he won the NCAA Outdoor Track Champion and was a two-time All-American. He also won the U.S. Junior National Champion and Pan American Junior Athletics Championships.

Kenny Rose's athletic career is also notable. He played for the New York Jets, Cleveland Browns, and Philadelphia Eagles, and he attended the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he played alongside Randall Cunningham.

Nevada Union High School is a high school that produces successful athletes. The school's athletic program has produced athletes such as Randall Cunningham II and Vashti Cunningham, who have gone on to excel in their respective sports. The school's track and field team has produced several state champions, and the football team has a strong reputation for producing talented players.

Adam Thielen, a wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings, is another notable athlete who played multiple sports in high school. He was a multi-sport athlete at Minnesota State University and signed with the Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2013.

Overall, the passage highlights the achievements of multi-sport athletes who have excelled in both high school and college. These athletes have gone on to achieve great success in their respective sports, and their experiences serve as an inspiration to other young athletes who are considering playing multiple sports.

Old and New is a compilation album by English musician Phil Collins.  The album was released by Atlantic Recording Corporation and Rhino Entertainment on 28 September 2004.  The album was released only a few months after the box set The Platinum Collection, which appeared earlier in the year (see 2004 in music). Sharon Gannon (born July 4, 1951 in Washington, D.C.) is a yoga teacher, animal rights advocate, musician, author, dancer/choreographer and painter.  Along with David Life, she is the co-founder of the Jivamukti Yoga Method which contributed to the exponential rise in popularity of yoga in the west during the late 20th century.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method distinguishes itself as a path to enlightenment by promoting compassion for all beings, challenging the modern belief that enslaving and exploiting animals and the natural world is our right as the dominant species.  The Jivamukti Yoga Method teaches its students that they must be willing to promote the happiness of all beings without exception if they wish to realize their fullest capacity for joy.  Jivamukti students are encouraged to adopt a diet that eliminates all animal products (vegan) as this is the diet that causes the least amount of harm to the earth and other beings, humans included.  Core to the teachings of Jivamukti Yoga is the concept of shunyata or (emptiness) which is found in the ancient yogic scriptures.  This idea can be simply stated as: everything you see and experience in the world comes from your perception of it.  If you want to change someone or to change the world, you start by changing yourself by changing your views.  When you begin to embrace this concept and put it into practice then you cannot find solace in complaining or blaming others.  You are freed from seeing yourself as a victim of others or of circumstances.  According to Gannon: How you treat others will determine how others treat you.  How others treat you will determine how you see yourself.  How you see yourself will determine who you are. See Yourself is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1976 album Thirty Three & 1/3.  Harrison began writing the song in 1967, while he was a member of the Beatles, in response to the public outcry surrounding bandmate Paul McCartney's admission that he had taken the hallucinogenic drug LSD.  McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity.  In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions.  Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks Within You Without You and All You Need Is Love. English musician Syd Barrett recorded many songs during his short career as a musician.  One of the founding members of English rock band Pink Floyd, he was the dominant force of the band in their early years, writing most of the material found on their first album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, contributing to their second one, A Saucerful of Secrets, and recording several unreleased songs with the band.  Due to increasing mental illness, Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 and was subsequently replaced by guitarist David Gilmour.  After Pink Floyd, Barrett would record two solo albums, both released in 1970, before Barrett left the music business entirely in 1972. No Plan is an extended play, comprising songs written and recorded by English musician David Bowie, released posthumously on 8 January 2017.  The release coincided with what would have been Bowie's 70th birthday, almost a year after his death.  No Plan compiles the original songs written for Bowie's Broadway musical, Lazarus, including the titular Lazarus, No Plan, Killing a Little Time, and When I Met You.  The songs were first recorded by the cast of the musical as part of its official soundtrack.  The recordings featured on No Plan come from the sessions for Bowie's twenty-fifth and final studio album Blackstar, with Lazarus appearing as the third track on the album.  Upon release, No Plan debuted at #138 on the Billboard 200.  The music video for the title track was also released in accompaniment with the EP.  It was directed by Tom Hingston. We Laughed is a three-track single by English musician Billy Bragg as part of the Rosetta Life project.  The single was released in 2005 in the UK and peaked at No. 11.  It also reached No. 38 in Ireland in 2006.  For the three songs on the single, Bragg collaborated with three patients of Trimar Hospice in Weymouth, who each wrote lyrics based on their illness and feelings.  The songs were produced by English guitarist Robbie McIntosh. Who Can See It is a song by English musician George Harrison, released on his 1973 album Living in the Material World.  The lyrics reflect Harrison's uneasy feelings towards the Beatles' legacy, three years after the group's break-up, and serve as his statement of independence from expectations raised by the band's unprecedented popularity.  Some music critics and biographers suggest that he wrote the song during a period of personal anguish, following the acclaim he had received as a solo artist with the 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass and his 1971–72 Bangladesh aid project.  The revelatory nature of the lyrics has encouraged comparisons between Living in the Material World and John Lennon's primal therapy-inspired 1970 release, Plastic Ono Band. 5:55 is the second album by French musician and actress Charlotte Gainsbourg.  It is also her first album release in twenty years.  Charlotte collaborated on the album with French duo Air, English musician Jarvis Cocker, and Irish singer-songwriter Neil Hannon, as well as Radiohead's main producer Nigel Godrich.  The Songs That We Sing and 5:55 were released as singles.  The album went platinum in France, selling over 500,000 copies.  In the United States, the album sold a modest 22,000 copies.  The Songs That We Sing was #78 on Rolling Stone' s list of the 100 Best Songs of 2007. Colin Murray Gem Archer (born 7 December 1966) is an English musician, best known as a member of the English rock bands Oasis, Beady Eye and Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds.  He is also known for his work with Heavy Stereo.  He joined Oasis as rhythm guitarist in November 1999, and handled lead guitar for acoustic songs as well.  He also contributed to the writing of some of the band's songs.  Oasis broke up in August 2009, but in November 2009, Liam Gallagher announced he was writing new material with Archer as well as other ex-Oasis members minus his brother Noel, under the name Beady Eye.  After two albums with Beady Eye, 2011's Different Gear, Still Speeding and 2013's BE, the band officially disbanded in October 2014.  In 2017, Archer joined Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds as lead guitarist, thus reuniting with former Oasis member Noel Gallagher. Within You Without You is a song written by George Harrison and released on the Beatles' 1967 album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  It was Harrison's second composition in the Indian classical style, after Love You To, and was inspired by his six-week stay in India with his mentor and sitar teacher, Ravi Shankar, over September–October 1966.  Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle.  The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas.  Although the song was his only composition on Sgt. Pepper, Harrison's endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover. [/INST]

Born in Los Angeles, Grinnage made his first television appearances in 1954.  The following year, he played as Moose – one of three teenage rebels who chase James Dean – in Rebel Without a Cause (1955).  Rebel Without a Cause was his first movie where he received a screen credit. Rebel Without a Pause is a song by hip hop group Public Enemy and the first single from their 1988 album, It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back.  The title is a reference to the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause. This is also the first song to sample Funky Drummer. CBS Television Workshop is an American anthology series which aired on CBS from January to April 1952.  The series is noted for featuring early television appearances of several well known actors including Audrey Hepburn, James Dean and Grace Kelly. James Gilmore Backus (February 25, 1913 – July 3, 1989) was an American radio, television, film, and voice actor.  Among his most famous roles were the voice of nearsighted cartoon character Mr. Magoo, the rich Hubert Updike III on the radio version of The Alan Young Show, Joan Davis' character's husband (a domestic court judge) on TV's I Married Joan, James Dean's character's father in Rebel Without a Cause, and Thurston Howell III, on the 1960s sitcom Gilligan's Island.  He also starred in his own show of one season, The Jim Backus Show, also known as Hot Off the Wire. Rebel Highway was a short-lived revival of American International Pictures created and produced by Lou Arkoff, the son of Samuel Z. Arkoff and Debra Hill for the Showtime channel in 1994.  The concept was 10-week series of 1950s drive-in classic B-movies remade with a '90s edge.  The impetus for the series, according to Arkoff was, what it would be like if you made Rebel Without a Cause today.  It would be more lurid, sexier, and much more dangerous, and you definitely would have had Natalie Wood's top off.  Originally, Arkoff wanted to call the series, Raging Hormones but Showtime decided on Rebel Highway instead.  Arkoff and Hill invited several directors to pick a title from one of Samuel Arkoff's movies, hire their own writers and create a story that could resemble the original if they wanted.  In addition, they had the right to a final cut and select their own director of photography and the editor.  Each director was given a $1.3 million budget and 12 days to shoot it with a cast of young, up and coming actors and actresses.  According to Arkoff, the appeal to directors was that, They weren't hampered by big studios saying, 'You can't do this or that.'  And all the directors paid very close attention to the detail of the era.  We want these shows to be fun for the younger generation and fun for the older generation. Corey Allen (June 29, 1934 – June 27, 2010) was an American film and television director, writer, producer, and actor.  He began his career as an actor but eventually became a television director.  He may be best known for playing the character Buzz Gunderson in Nicholas Ray's Rebel Without a Cause (1955). James Byron Dean (February 8, 1931 – September 30, 1955) was an American actor.  He is remembered as a cultural icon of teenage disillusionment and social estrangement, as expressed in the title of his most celebrated film, Rebel Without a Cause (1955), in which he starred as troubled teenager Jim Stark.  The other two roles that defined his stardom were loner Cal Trask in East of Eden (1955) and surly ranch hand Jett Rink in Giant (1956). Casey Braxton is a fictional character from the Australian Channel Seven soap opera Home and Away, played by Lincoln Younes.  Casey made his first on-screen appearance on 17 February 2011.  Younes was about to go travelling when he auditioned for the role of Casey.  He changed his plans upon winning the role.  In late 2010 the Seven Network began airing trailers for a new trio of characters known as The River Boys.  The trio consist of Casey and his older half-brothers Darryl (Steve Peacocke) and Heath Braxton (Dan Ewing).  The River Boys arrive in Summer Bay from neighbouring town Mangrove River.  Casey is characterised as being a modern day Rebel Without a Cause; who is intelligent and unsure about what he wants out of life.  Younes has described him as the epitome of teenage angst.  The River Boys cause trouble in Summer Bay and producers were inspired by Koby Abberton's Bra Boys in the creation process.  Casey is portrayed as wanting to distance himself from their bad reputation; but his anger issues often mar his attempts. Stewart Henry Stern (March 22, 1922 – February 2, 2015) was an American screenwriter.  He is best known for writing the screenplay for the film Rebel Without a Cause (1955), starring James Dean.

Passage: General elections were held in Sweden on September 19, 1982, resulting in the return of the Swedish Social Democratic Party to power after six years in opposition. The center-right coalition led by Thorbjörn Fälldin lost power due to the withdrawal of the rightist Moderate Party, which protested against the centrist tax policies of the Fälldin government. After regaining power, socialist leader Olof Palme became Prime Minister again, a position he held until his assassination in 1986. Bal'arab bin Himyar was one of the rival Imams during the civil wars in Oman in the final years of the Yaruba dynasty. He was elected Imam in 1728 and held power in the interior of Oman, while his cousin, Saif bin Sultan II, held power on the coast. In 1737, he renounced his claim after being defeated by Saif's Persian allies. He was again elected Imam in 1743 during another Persian invasion and held power in the interior, while Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi was recognized as ruler by the coastal people. He died in battle against Ahmad bin Said in 1749. Ahmad became the undisputed ruler of the country. The Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM) is the largest confederation of labor unions in Mexico and was one of the essential pillars of the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI), which ruled Mexico for over seventy years. However, the CTM began to lose influence within the PRI structure in the late 1980s, as technocrats increasingly held power within the party. Eventually, the union found itself forced to deal with a new party in power after the PRI lost the 2000 general election, drastically reducing the CTM's influence in Mexican politics. The United Bermuda Party (UBP) was a political party in Bermuda that represented itself as a centrist party advocating for a moderate social and fiscal agenda. The party held power in Bermuda's House of Assembly continuously from 1968 to 1998 and officially ceased operations on June 30, 2011, after the majority of its members joined the One Bermuda Alliance. Federal elections for the House of Representatives were held in Australia on December 2, 1972, and were won by the Australian Labor Party led by Gough Whitlam.

The elections ended 23 years of successive Coalition governments that held power since 1949. Albania, officially the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, was a socialist state that ruled Albania from 1946 to its fall in 1992. The country had a reputation for its Stalinist style of state administration dominated by the Party of Labour of Albania and for policies stressing national unity and self-reliance. Travel and visa restrictions made Albania one of the most difficult countries to visit or travel from. In 1967, it declared itself the world's first atheist state. It was the only Warsaw Pact member to officially withdraw from the alliance before 1990, an action occasioned by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. The first multi-party elections in Socialist Albania took place on March 31, 1991, and the communists gained a majority in an interim government. The first parliamentary elections were held on March 22, 1992. The People's Socialist Republic was officially dissolved on November 28, 1998, upon the adoption of the new Constitution of Albania.

The team competes at the NCAA Division I level in the FBS and is a member of the Pac-12 Conference (Pac-12).  Known as the Ducks, the team was commonly called the Webfoots until the mid-1960s.  The first football team was fielded in 1894.  Oregon plays its home games at the 54,000 seat Autzen Stadium in Eugene; its main rivals are the Oregon State Beavers and the Washington Huskies.  The Ducks and Beavers historically end each regular season with the Civil War rivalry game in late November. The Civil War is the colloquial name for an American college football rivalry game played annually in Oregon, between the Ducks of the University of Oregon in Eugene and the Beavers of Oregon State University in Corvallis.  First played in 1894, it is the fifth most played college football rivalry game in NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision.  Both universities are members of the North Division of the Pac-12 Conference. The Textile Bowl is an American college football rivalry game played annually by the Clemson Tigers football team of Clemson University and the NC State Wolfpack football team of North Carolina State University.  The rivalry game has been known as the Textile Bowl since 1981.  The two universities are founding members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), and both have competed in the ACC's Atlantic Division since the conference initiated divisional play.  The rivalry's name is derived from the fact that Clemson and North Carolina State have two of the largest university-level textile schools in the world, and from the textile industry's historic importance in the economic development of their respective states of South Carolina and North Carolina. The Rivalry is an American college football rivalry game played by the Lafayette Leopards football team of Lafayette College and the Lehigh Mountain Hawks football team of Lehigh University.  It is the most-played football rivalry in the nation and the longest uninterrupted annual rivalry series.  As of 2016, The Rivalry has been played 152 times since 1884 with only a single interruption in 1896.  The college's football teams met twice annually (except 1891, when they played three games, and 1896, when they did not play at all) until 1901.  The two institutions are located seventeen miles apart in the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania.  Though primarily alluding to football, The Rivalry pertains to a meeting between the two schools in all sports and other endeavors. The 1983 Oregon State vs. Oregon football game was a college football game played on November 19, 1983, at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon, the 87th playing of the annual Civil War rivalry game.  The game ended in a scoreless tie.  Since overtime was added to NCAA Division I games in 1996, this game is likely to be the last ever with that distinction. The LSU–Ole Miss football rivalry, renamed the Magnolia Bowl in 2008, is an American college football rivalry game played annually by the LSU Tigers football team of Louisiana State University (LSU) and the Ole Miss Rebels football team of the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss).  The teams compete for the Magnolia Bowl Trophy.  The Tigers and the Rebels first met in 1894, and have been regular opponents in Southeastern Conference (SEC), meeting annually since 1945.  The rivalry was at its height during the 1950s and 1960s, when both teams were highly ranked and during which time both teams claimed a national championship.  The rivalry died down from the 1970s to the 1990s, owing to Ole Miss not returning to conference or national prominence since the 1970s and because LSU has seen new rivalries emerge when the SEC split into two divisions in 1992, most notably Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, and Florida.  Even though the rivalry has not attracted the same national attention in recent years, it still stirs up passion in both Oxford and Baton Rouge. Joe Walker (born December 11, 1992) is an American football linebacker for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL).  He played college football at Oregon. The Battle of the Blue is an annual college football rivalry game between the University of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens and Villanova University Wildcats.  The first game was played between the two teams in 1895, was played annually from 1964 to 1980 when Villanova dropped football, and then resumed with the re-emergence of Villanova football having been played annually since 1988.  Beginning in 2007, the annual Delaware–Villanova game became known as Battle of the Blue.  As part of this concept, the winning team gets to keep the Battle of the Blue Trophy at its institution for the year and is responsible for bringing the trophy to the following installment of the rivalry game.  The trophy consists of a football with a Villanova logo and the Wildcat shade of blue on one side and the Blue Hen logo and the Delaware shade of blue on the other side.  The ball sits in a wooden platform and the scores of each game are engraved on the base of the trophy.  Villanova had possession of the trophy for the first four years, until Delaware won in 2011. The Army–Navy Game is an American college rivalry game in college football between the Army Black Knights of the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, and the Navy Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy (USNA) at Annapolis, Maryland.  The Black Knights (formerly the Army Cadets and Army Black Knights) and Midshipmen each represent their service's oldest officer commissioning sources.  As such, the game has come to embody the spirit of the interservice rivalry of the United States Armed Forces.  The game marks the end of the college football regular season and the third and final game of the season's Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series, which also includes the Air Force Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Battle for the Bell is an American college football rivalry game played by the Marshall Thundering Herd football team of Marshall University and the Ohio Bobcats football team of Ohio University.  It is a regional rivalry, with the universities' campuses located about 80 miles (130 km) from each other, with a bell awarded as the trophy for the winner of the game.  With Marshall's move from the Mid-American Conference to Conference USA in 2005, this rivalry game was on hiatus for several years.  The series unexpectedly resumed in 2009 when the Herd and Bobcats faced off in the 2009 Little Caesars Pizza Bowl, which Marshall won 21–17.  A six-year contract between the schools began in 2010.  Ohio leads the all-time series over Marshall 33–20–6. [/INST]

Pulmonary rehabilitation, also known as respiratory rehabilitation, is an important part of the management and health maintenance of people with chronic respiratory disease who remain symptomatic or continue to have decreased function despite standard medical treatment.  It is a broad therapeutic concept.  It is defined by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society as an evidence-based, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive intervention for patients with chronic respiratory diseases who are symptomatic and often have decreased daily life activities.  In general, pulmonary rehabilitation refers to a series of services that are administered to patients of respiratory disease and their families, typically to attempt to improve the quality of life for the patient.  Pulmonary rehabilitation may be carried out in a variety of settings, depending on the patient's needs, and may or may not include pharmacologic intervention. The Journal of Thoracic Disease is a peer-reviewed open access medical journal covering pulmonology.  It was established in December 2009 and is published monthly by AME Publishing Company.  It is the official journal of the State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease, the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Disease, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, and the Society for Thoracic Disease.  The editor-in-chief is Zhong Nanshan (Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases).  According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2016 impact factor of 2.365. Yi Guan is a Chinese virologist who, in 2014, was ranked as 11th in the world by Thomson Reuters (now known as Clarivate Analytics) among global researchers in the field of microbiology.  His research on the viral respiratory disease SARS allowed the Chinese government to successfully avert the 2004 outbreak of this disease.  He is the current Director (China affairs) of the State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases University of Hong Kong.  In early 2017, Guan warned that the H7N9 influenza virus poses the greatest threat to humanity than any other in the past 100 years. The Irish Thoracic Society (ITS) is the official society for professionals involved in the care of people with chronic or acute respiratory disease in Ireland.  Membership of the Society is drawn from respiratory physicians, internal medicine physicians, pediatricians, thoracic surgeons, general practitioners, junior doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, dietitians, pulmonary function and respiratory therapists, scientists and other healthcare providers who specialize or have an interest in respiratory disease and care throughout Ireland - North and South. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV).  Between November 2002 and July 2003, an outbreak of SARS in southern China caused an eventual 8,098 cases, resulting in 774 deaths reported in 37 countries, with the majority of cases in Hong Kong (9.6% fatality rate) according to the World Health Organization (WHO).  No cases of SARS have been reported worldwide since 2004. Chronic Respiratory Disease is a quarterly peer-reviewed medical journal that covers research in the field of respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory failure, and obstructive sleep apnea.  The editors-in-chief are Mike Morgan (Glenfield Hospital), Carolyn Rochester (Yale University), and Sally Singh (Glenfield Hospital).  It was established in 2004 and is published by SAGE Publications. SARS is severe acute respiratory syndrome, a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by the SARS coronavirus. Feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) is an upper respiratory or pulmonary infection of cats caused by feline herpesvirus 1, of the family Herpesviridae.  It is also commonly referred to as feline influenza, feline coryza, and feline pneumonia but, as these terms describe other very distinct collections of respiratory symptoms, they are misnomers for the condition.  Viral respiratory diseases in cats can be serious, especially in catteries and kennels. Causing one-half of the respiratory diseases in cats, FVR is the most important of these diseases and is found worldwide.  The other important cause of feline respiratory disease is feline calicivirus. Chronic Mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections are associated with the onset and exacerbation of asthma.  These microbial infections result in chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, an increase in mucous production and eventually asthma.  Furthermore, children who experience severe viral respiratory infections early in life have a high possibility of having asthma later in their childhood.  These viral respiratory infections are mostly caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV).  Although RSV infections increase the risk of asthma in early childhood, the association between asthma and RSV decreases with increasing age.  HRV on the other hand is an important cause of bronchiolitis and is strongly associated with asthma development.  In children and adults with established asthma, viral upper respiratory tract infections (URIs), especially HRVs infections, can produce acute exacerbations of asthma.  Thus, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and human rhinoviruses are microbes that play a major role in non-atopic asthma. [/INST]

Pulmonary rehabilitation is a comprehensive intervention that includes evidence-based therapies and multidisciplinary care to improve the quality of life for patients with chronic respiratory diseases. The Journal of Thoracic Disease is a peer-reviewed medical journal that covers research in the field of pulmonology, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory failure, and obstructive sleep apnea. Yi Guan, a Chinese virologist, was instrumental in aiding the Chinese government in averted the 2004 outbreak of SARS, a viral respiratory disease that can cause severe respiratory illness and death. The Irish Thoracic Society (ITS) is the official society for healthcare professionals involved in the care of people with chronic or acute respiratory disease in Ireland. Chronic respiratory disease is a quarterly peer-reviewed medical journal that covers research in the field of respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory failure, and obstructive sleep apnea.

The passage also mentions that viral respiratory diseases, such as SARS and feline viral rhinotracheitis, can be serious and potentially life-threatening, especially in catteries and kennels. These diseases can cause one-half of all respiratory diseases in cats and are found worldwide. Additionally, chronic mycoplasma pneumonia and Chlamydia pneumonia infections have been linked to the development and exacerbation of asthma in children and adults. These infections can cause chronic lower airway inflammation, impaired mucociliary clearance, and an increase in mucous production, eventually leading to asthma.

Omar Ahmed Sayid Khadr (born September 19, 1986) is a Canadian citizen who was detained by the United States at Guantanamo Bay for ten years, from the age of 16, during which he pleaded guilty to the murder of U.S. Army Sergeant 1st Class Christopher Speer and other charges.

Khadr sued the Canadian government for infringing his rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms; this lawsuit was settled in 2017 with a $10.5 million (USD 8 million) payment and an apology by the federal government. A liability insurance company's duty to settle is defined as an implied obligation to by the insurer to a policyholder and to a claimant to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.  To the surprise of many, a typical liability insurance policy makes no express contractual promise to settle.  In California, an insurer, who wrongfully refuses to accept a reasonable settlement within the policy limits is liable for the entire judgment against the insured even if it exceeds the policy limits.  A rationale for this duty is that [w]hen an offer is made to settle a claim in excess of policy limits for an amount within policy limits, a genuine and immediate conflict of interest arises between carrier and assured.  An insurer who denies coverage does so at its own risk.  Such factors as a belief that the policy does not provide coverage, should not affect a decision as to whether the settlement offer in question is a reasonable one.  It is the duty of the insurer to keep the insured informed of settlement offers.  [A]n insurer potentially can be liable for unreasonably coercing an insured to contribute to a settlement fund.

Damian Wayne or Damian al Ghul (Arabic: داميان الغول) is a fictional superhero and at times antihero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, commonly in association with Batman.  He is the son of Batman and Talia al Ghul (Arabic: تاليا الغول), and thus, the grandson of Batman villain Ra's al Ghul.  The character originally appeared as an unnamed infant in the 1987 story , which at that time was not considered canon.  Following this, various alternate universe stories dealt with the character's life, giving him various names.  In 2006, the character was reinterpreted as Damian Wayne by Grant Morrison, and introduced into the main continuity in Batman #655, the first issue of the Batman and Son story arc.  Damian Wayne is the fifth character to assume the role of Robin, Batman's vigilante partner. The following is a list of the 20 largest settlements reached between the United States Department of Justice and pharmaceutical companies from 1991 to 2012, ordered by the size of the total settlement.  The settlement amount includes both the civil (False Claims Act) settlement and criminal fine.  Glaxo's $3 billion settlement included the largest civil, False Claims Act settlement on record, and Pfizer’s $2.3 billion settlement including a record-breaking $1.3 billion criminal fine.  Legal claims against the pharmaceutical industry have varied widely over the past two decades, including Medicare and Medicaid fraud, off-label promotion, and inadequate manufacturing practices.  With respect to off-label promotion, specifically, a federal court recognized off-label promotion as a violation of the False Claims Act for the first time in Franklin v. Parke-Davis, leading to a $430 million settlement. Al Utouriya is a settlement in Qatar, located in the municipality of Al-Shahaniya.  It used to be part of the Al Jemailiya municipality before the municipality was incorporated into Al Rayyan.  In 2014, the settlement was incorporated into the newly-created Al-Shahaniya Municipality.

In 2012, she recommended to her close friend Baptiste Giabiconi, to date Katy Perry. Tell El Sakan was an important ancient Egyptian maritime settlement during the early Bronze Age, situated at the mouth of wadi Ghazzeh.  Its geographical situation endowed it with a position of importance at the crossroads on the land based trade routes to Arabia, the Egyptian empire to the south and the Canaan region to the north.  The site (dated between 3500-2350 BCE) appears to be the predecessor to the Tell al-'Ajjul settlement, where geomorphological dynamics of the estuary caused settlement trans-location or abandonment.  The site dates from a period prior to the Egyptian military domination of the Levant.  The pottery finds at Tell es-Sakan along with Tell al-'Ajjul shows a strong ancient Egyptian link to the area, while the Bronze Age settlement at Taur Ikhbeineh has revealed a more localised pottery production with Egyptian-Canaanite interaction.

Severe Tropical Cyclone Donna was the strongest off-season South Pacific tropical cyclone on record during May 2017. Formed from an area of disturbed weather monitored west-northwest of Fiji on May 1, the storm drifted eastward amid a favorable environment and intensified into a Category 1 cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone scale. Continuing to strengthen, Donna reached its initial peak as a Category 4 cyclone on May 6, before weakening due to wind shear and upwelling. However, the storm reintensified into a Category 5 cyclone on May 8 and maintained this intensity as it made landfall on Odisha on May 29. Donna steadily weakened due to persistent land interaction and dry air, eventually dissipating on June 16. Other notable tropical cyclones in the South Pacific basin include Severe Tropical Cyclone Anne, which affected Vanuatu in the 1980s, and Super Cyclonic Storm Gonu, the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the Arabian Sea. Additionally, the 2002–03 Australian region cyclone season included Cyclone Inigo, which tied Cyclone Gwenda in 1999 as the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Australian basin.

New Jersey earned more battle stars for combat actions than the other three completed Iowa-class battleships, and was the only US battleship providing gunfire support during the Vietnam War. Operation Market Time was the United States Navy and South Vietnam’s successful effort begun in 1965 to stop the flow of troops, war material, and supplies by sea, coast, and rivers, from North Vietnam into parts of South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.  Also participating in Operation Market Time were United States Coast Guard Squadron One and Squadron Three.  The Coast Guard provided heavily armed 82 ft patrol boats and large cutters that included 5 cannons used in battle and gunfire support. USS Trippe (FF-1075) was a Knox-class frigate of the US Navy, built at Westwego, Louisiana, was commissioned in mid-September 1970.  In July 1971, following shakedown training in the Caribbean area and a surveillance mission off Haiti, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul and installation of the Basic Point Defense Missile System, which featured short-range Sea Sparrow guided missiles in an eight-round launcher on her afterdeck.  Trippe was the Navy's first destroyer-type ship to receive this later-widespread contribution to shipboard protection against air and missile attack.  The first months of 1972 were spent testing her new weapons and participating in exercises.  In June the ship passed through the Panama Canal en route to Southeast Asian waters, where she provided Vietnam War aircraft carrier escort and naval gunfire support services during July and August.  Trippe then went to the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf areas, visiting many ports in a region that would see increasing U.S. Navy activity in the coming decades.  She returned to the U.S. East Coast in December 1972, after a deployment that had taken her completely around the World. Rear Adm. J. Edward Snyder, USN (Ret.)  (October 23, 1924 – November 4, 2007) was notable as the captain of the battleship USS New Jersey during that ship's deployment to the Vietnam War in 1968.  Considered by those serving on the New Jersey to be a sailor's captain, Captain Snyder was able to motivate his men through his more relaxed shipboard policies. The United States naval gunfire support debate is an ongoing debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and independent groups like the United States Naval Gunfire Support Association over what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role can best be provided.  At the heart of the issue is the role that naval gunfire support—the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range—should play in the U.S. Navy of the 21st century. Naval gunfire support (NGFS) (also known as shore bombardment) is the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range.  NGFS is one of a number of disciplines encompassed by the term Naval Fires.  Modern naval gunfire support is one of the three main components of amphibious warfare assault operations support, along with aircraft and ship-launched land-attack missiles. Shipborne guns have been used against shore defences since the early days of naval warfare. Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club was a tongue-in-cheek nickname for the United States Seventh Fleet during the Vietnam War.  All through the war in Vietnam, the Seventh Fleet engaged in combat operations against enemy forces through attack carrier air strikes, naval gunfire support, amphibious operations, patrol and reconnaissance operations and mine warfare. Starting in the 1890s, the Italian Regia Marina (Royal Navy) began building a series of modern battleships.  Early designs were marked by their small size, light armor, and high speed compared to contemporary foreign counterparts.  The first pre-dreadnought battleship design, the Ammiraglio di Saint Bon class , was constrained by budgetary limits imposed by the legislature.  Two ships were ordered by the class's namesake, Admiral Simone de Pacoret Saint Bon, though the design was also influenced by Benedetto Brin, who replaced di Saint Bon as naval minister after his death.  Brin designed the next pair of battleships, the Regina Margherita class .  These ships were larger than the preceding class, and were intended to challenge the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg-class battleship s then under construction.  Brin himself died during the construction process.  Vittorio Cuniberti designed the next class of small pre-dreadnoughts, the Regina Elena class , which were the fastest battleships in the world at the time of their completion.  These ships all served in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12, where they were primarily used to provide naval gunfire support for the Italian ground troops, as the Ottoman Navy largely confined itself to port. Kirov (Russian: Киров ; ] ) was a Project 26 Kirov-class cruiser of the Soviet Navy that served during the Winter War, World War II and into the Cold War.  She attempted to bombard Finnish coast defense guns during action in the Winter War, but was driven off by a number of near misses that damaged her.  She led the Evacuation of Tallinn at the end of August 1941, before being blockaded in Leningrad where she could only provide gunfire support during the Siege of Leningrad.  She bombarded Finnish positions during the Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive in mid-1944, but played no further part in the war.  Kirov was reclassified as a training cruiser on 2 August 1961 and sold for scrap on 22 February 1974. Jean Bart was the second ship of the Courbet-class battleship s, the first dreadnoughts built for the French Navy.  She was completed before World War I as part of the 1910 naval building programme.  She spent the war in the Mediterranean and helped to sink the Austro-Hungarian protected cruiser Zenta on 16 August 1914.  She spent most of the rest of 1914 providing gunfire support for the Montenegrin Army until she was torpedoed by the submarine U-12 on 21 December.  Even with three compartments flooded, she was able to steam to Malta on her own for repairs that required three and a half months.  Upon her return she spent the remainder of the war participating in the Otranto Barrage, in the Adriatic. [/INST]

USS New Jersey (BB-62), an Iowa-class battleship, earned the nickname "Big J" or "Black Dragon" due to its exceptional service during the Vietnam War. The ship was the second US Navy vessel to be named after the state of New Jersey and was commissioned in 1943. New Jersey distinguished itself during the war by providing extensive gunfire support to ground troops, earning more battle stars than any other completed Iowa-class battleship.

The United States Navy and South Vietnam's Operation Market Time, initiated in 1965, aimed to prevent the transportation of troops, weapons, and supplies from North Vietnam to South Vietnam by sea, rivers, and coastal areas. The operation was supported by the US Coast Guard, which deployed heavily armed patrol boats and cutters equipped with five cannons. USS Trippe (FF-1075), a Knox-class frigate, was one of the Navy's first destroyer-type ships to install the Basic Point Defense Missile System, featuring short-range Sea Sparrow guided missiles.

Captain J. Edward Snyder, a retired US Navy rear admiral, was the commanding officer of the USS New Jersey during its deployment to the Vietnam War in 1968. Snyder was known for his more relaxed shipboard policies, which motivated his crew to perform at their best. The debate surrounding US naval gunfire support, which involves the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for ground troops, has been ongoing for decades. This issue is central to the US Navy's amphibious warfare assault operations and has been a critical component of combat operations in Vietnam and other conflicts.

The Tonkin Gulf Yacht Club was a colloquial nickname for the US Seventh Fleet during the Vietnam War. The Seventh Fleet engaged in combat operations against enemy forces through air strikes, naval gunfire support, amphibious operations, patrol and reconnaissance missions, and mine warfare. The Italian Regia Marina, or Royal Navy, began constructing modern battleships in the late 19th century. Early designs were limited by budget constraints, leading to smaller ships with light armor and high speeds compared to foreign counterparts. The Regina Margherita-class battleships were larger and more powerful than the preceding Ammiraglio di Saint Bon-class, and were intended to challenge the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg-class battleships.

The Soviet Navy's Kirov-class cruiser, Kirov, served during the Winter War, World War II, and the Cold War. During the Winter War, Kirov attempted to bombard Finnish coastal defenses but was driven off by near misses. The ship played a crucial role in the Evacuation of Tallinn and provided gunfire support during the Siege of Leningrad. Kirov was later reclassified as a training cruiser and sold for scrap in 1974.

The French Navy's Courbet-class battleship, Jean Bart, was completed in 1910 as part of the naval building program. During World War I, Jean Bart spent time in the Mediterranean and provided gunfire support for the Montenegrin Army. The ship was torpedoed by a German submarine on December 21, 1914, but was able to steam to Malta for repairs. Jean Bart spent the remainder of the war participating in the Otranto Barrage in the Adriatic.

As a life insurance policy it represents a contract between the insured and insurer that as long as the contract terms are met, the insurer will pay the death benefit of the policy to the policy's beneficiaries when the insured dies.  Because whole life policies are guaranteed to remain in force as long as the required premiums are paid, the premiums are typically much higher than those of term life insurance where the premium is fixed only for a limited term.  Whole life premiums are fixed, based on the age of issue, and usually do not increase with age.  The insured party normally pays premiums until death, except for limited pay policies which may be paid-up in 10 years, 20 years, or at age 65.  Whole life insurance belongs to the cash value category of life insurance, which also includes universal life, variable life, and endowment policies. Manhattan Life Insurance Company, incorporated on May 29, 1850, is a life insurance company domiciled in New York but operates as a subsidiary of Manhattan Life Group in Houston, Texas.

The Supreme Life Building is a historic insurance building located at 3501 S. Dr. Martin Luther King Drive in the Douglas community area of Chicago, Illinois.  Built in 1921, the building served as the headquarters of the Supreme Life Insurance Company, which was founded two years earlier.  The company, originally known as the Liberty Life Insurance Company, was the first African-American owned insurance company in the northern United States.  Since white-owned insurance firms regularly denied black customers life insurance when the firm was founded, the firm played an important role in providing life insurance to Chicago's African-American community.  The company ultimately became the largest African-American owned business in the northern states and became a symbol of the predominantly black Bronzeville neighborhood's economic success from the 1920s to the 1950s. The Manhattan Life Insurance Building was a 348 ft tower at 64-66 Broadway in New York City completed in 1894 to the designs of the architects of Kimball & Thompson and slightly extended north in 1904 making its new address 64-70 Broadway.  It was the first skyscraper to pass 100 m in Manhattan. Montreal's New York Life Insurance Building (also known as the Quebec Bank Building) is an office building at Place d'Armes in what is now known as Old Montreal, erected in 1887-1889.  At the time of its completion, it was the tallest commercial building in Montreal with the first eight floors were designed for retail office space, that quickly filled with the city's best lawyers and financiers.  When the clock tower was completed, the owner filled the ninth and tenth floors with the largest legal library in the entire country as a gift to tenants.  The building is next to another historic office tower, Aldred Building. Francis Hatch Kimball (1845–1919) was an American architect practicing in New York City, best known for his work on skyscrapers in lower Manhattan and terra-cotta ornamentation.  He was an associate with the firm Kimball & Thompson.  His work includes the Empire Building, Manhattan Life Insurance Building, and Casino Theatre (Broadway).  All but one of Kimball's work was in the United States. 712 5th Avenue is a 650 ft skyscraper at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue in the Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.  It was constructed from 1990 to 1991 and is the 53rd tallest building in New York City.  The tower's design had to accommodate the landmarked facades of the Coty and Rizzoli Buildings at the base of the tower.  It was purchased by the Bannister Trust in 2007 in a Private Treaty, and placed in Property Fund #1 managed by JP Morgan.  The building is sometimes referred to as the Henri Bendel building. The Flatiron Building, originally the Fuller Building, is a triangular 22-story steel-framed landmarked building located at 175 Fifth Avenue in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, and is considered to be a groundbreaking skyscraper.  Upon completion in 1902, it was one of the tallest buildings in the city at 20 floors high and one of only two skyscrapers north of 14th Street – the other being the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, one block east.  The building sits on a triangular block formed by Fifth Avenue, Broadway, and East 22nd Street, with 23rd Street grazing the triangle's northern (uptown) peak.  As with numerous other wedge-shaped buildings, the name Flatiron derives from its resemblance to a cast-iron clothes iron.

The Duchy of Thuringia was established in 631 by King Dagobert I after his troops were defeated by the Slavic confederation of Samo at the Battle of Wogastisburg. The duchy was a frontier march of the Merovingian kingdom of Austrasia and was later recreated in the Carolingian Empire. The dukes were appointed by the king and ruled until the territory was absorbed by the Saxon dukes in 908. In the 7th century, the Sasanian Empire, which was the leading world power alongside the Roman-Byzantine Empire, was plunged into a period of upheaval and chaos. During this time, a Sasanian usurper named Khosrow IV ruled briefly before being killed. Another Sasanian king, Farrukhzad Khosrau V, briefly ruled the empire from March to April 631. Samo, a Frankish merchant, founded the first recorded political union of Slavic tribes, known as Samo's Empire, which stretched from Silesia to present-day Slovenia and lasted from 623 until his death in 658. Chach, a Brahmin, reigned as king of Sindh in the mid-7th century and expanded the kingdom, subjugating surrounding monarchies and ethnic groups. Ashur-etil-ilani was a king of Assyria who succeeded his father Ashurbanipal, and Suintila was the Visigothic King of Hispania, Septimania, and Galicia who retook lands that had been under the control of the Byzantine Empire. Samo's Empire was a Slavic tribal union established by King Samo that existed from 631 to 658, with its center in Moravia and including Silesia, Bohemia, Lusatia, and Carantania.

They are descendants of liberated Africans of Yoruba descent who settled in Sierra Leone in the mid-19th century and formed a distinct ethnic group. The Oku are predominantly Muslim and are known for their conservative religious practices. The British colonial government recognized the Oku Mohammedan community as a distinct ethnic group in Sierra Leone.

The Pinpu tribe, also called the Pepo or Plains tribes, are indigenous peoples who mainly settled in the western plains of Taiwan. They led a primitive agricultural life before the arrival of Han immigrants. Since the 17th century, they have faced the threat of assimilation from external forces such as the Dutch, Spanish, and Han Chinese. By the end of the 19th century, most Pingpu tribes had been assimilated into the Han Chinese culture, and they lost their languages and cultures. During the period of Japanese rule, Japanese scholars conducted research on the Plains tribes based on anthropology and ethnology.

The African Bermudians or Bermudians of African descent are the largest ethnic group in Bermuda. Their ancestry lies within the continent of Africa, and they were brought to Bermuda as slaves.

They found work in industrial labor and gained financial and social status in the latter half of the 19th century. They founded institutions and gained political power.

The Americo-Liberians, also known as the Congo people, are an ethnic group in Liberia of African-American, Afro-Caribbean, and liberated African descent. They are the founders of the state of Liberia and trace their ancestry to free-born and formerly enslaved African Americans who immigrated to Liberia in the 19th century.

Australian Property Law is the system of laws regulating and prioritising the rights, interests and responsibilities of individuals in relation to things.  These things are a form of property or right to possession or ownership of an object.  The law orders or prioritises rights and classifies property as either real and tangible, such as land, or intangible, such as the right of an author to their literary works or personal but tangible, such as a book or a pencil.  The scope of what constitutes a thing capable of being classified as property and when an individual or body corporate gains priority of interest over a thing has in legal scholarship been heavily debated on a philosophical level. William Goldman (born August 12, 1931) is an American novelist, playwright, and screenwriter.  He came to prominence in the 1950s as a novelist, before turning to writing for film.  He has won two Academy Awards for his screenplays, first for the western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and again for All the President's Men (1976), about journalists who broke the Watergate scandal of President Richard Nixon.  Both films starred Robert Redford. Joshua D.

Creationism is based on the idea of a poem as a truly new thing, created by the author for the sake of itself—that is, not to praise another thing, not to please the reader, not even to be understood by its own author. The Man Booker International Prize is an international hosted in the United Kingdom.  The introduction of the International Prize to complement the Man Booker Prize was announced in June 2004.  Sponsored by the Man Group, from 2005 until 2015 the award was given every two years to a living author of any nationality for a body of work published in English or generally available in English translation.  It rewarded one author's continued creativity, development and overall contribution to fiction on the world stage, and was a recognition of the writer's body of work rather than any one title.  The judges for the year compiled their own lists of authors, and submissions were not invited. The Viola Concerto by William Walton was written in 1929 for the violist Lionel Tertis at the suggestion of Sir Thomas Beecham.  The concerto carries the dedication To Christabel (Christabel McLaren, Lady Aberconway).  But Tertis rejected the manuscript, and composer and violist Paul Hindemith gave the first performance.  The work was greeted with enthusiasm.  It brought Walton to the forefront of British classical music.  In The Manchester Guardian, Eric Blom wrote, This young composer is a born genius and said that it was tempting to call the concerto the best thing in recent music of any nationality.  Tertis soon changed his mind and took the work up. “The Most Incredible Thing (Danish: Det Utroligste ) is a literary fairy tale by Danish poet and author Hans Christian Andersen (1805–1875).

In 2012, the American thriller film "Compliance" was released, written and directed by Craig Zobel and starring Ann Dowd, Dreama Walker, and Pat Healy. The plot centers around a prank caller who poses as a police officer and tricks the manager of a fast food restaurant into performing invasive and illegal procedures on an employee. The film is based on a real-life strip search prank call scam that took place at a McDonald's restaurant in Kentucky. Dowd's performance as the manager, Sandra, earned her the National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actress. The strip search prank call scam involved a man calling restaurants and grocery stores, claiming to be a police officer and convincing managers to conduct strip searches of female employees. The incidents were most common in small towns in rural areas of the United States. In 2016, the film's writer and director, Craig Zobel, published his first book, "The White Sari."

He started his minor league career as an outfielder, but later converted into a pitcher.  Fox compiled a career minor league batting average of .251 with 670 hits in 694 games played.  As a pitcher, he compiled a win–loss record of 90–63 in 185 career minor league games pitched.  Fox batted and threw right-handed.

One of the most fearsome and devastating hitters of his era, he is the only player in major league history to have seven consecutive seasons (1991–1997) with a .300 batting average and at least 100 runs batted in (RBI), 100 runs scored, 100 walks and 20 home runs; over that period, he batted .330 and averaged 36 home runs and 118 RBI per year.

After two subpar seasons, he lost the MVP in a close vote in 2000 after posting career highs of 43 home runs and 143 RBI, also earning AL Comeback Player of the Year honors, as Chicago finished with the AL's best record. Germán Barranca Costales (born October 19, 1956 in Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave, Mexico) is a former Major League Baseball second baseman.  On August 26, 1974 he was purchased by the Kansas City Royals from the Mexico City Reds.  He was listed at 6 feet tall and 160 pounds.  German made his major league debut on September 2, 1979 at the age of 22 with the Kansas City Royals vs the New York Yankees.  German played 5 games that year and also played 7 games with the Royals in 1980 with a batting average of .600 On January 21, was traded by the Kansas City Royals to the Cincinnati Reds for Cesar Geronimo.  Played for the Cincinnati Reds in 1981 with a batting average of .333 and 1982 batting average of .255 German last game in the MLB was July 11 1982 vs. CHC at age 25.  German was batting .250 and leading the National League in triples before the all star break was sent to Indianapolis the triple A of the Cincinnati Reds.  On September 7, 1982 was sent to the Detroit Tigers by the Cincinnati Reds as part of a conditional deal.  German played 4 years in Major League Baseball (2 years in the American League played 12 games ) and ( 2 years in the National League played 55 games ) with a total of 67 games, 62 AB, 19 Runs, 18 hits, 2 doubles, 3 triples, 5 stolen bases a fielding % of .893 and batting average of .290 The 1921 Detroit Tigers finished in sixth place in the American League, 27 games behind the Yankees, with a record of 71–82.  Despite their sixth-place finish, the 1921 Tigers amassed 1,724 hits and a team batting average of .316—the highest team hit total and batting average in American League history.  Detroit outfielders Harry Heilmann and Ty Cobb finished No. 1 and No. 2 in the American League batting race with batting averages of .394 and .389, and all three Detroit outfielders (Heilmann, Cobb, and Bobby Veach) ranked among the league leaders in batting average and RBIs.  As early proof of the baseball adage that Good Pitching Beats Good Hitting, the downfall of the 1921 Tigers was the absence of good pitching.  The team ERA was 4.40, they allowed nine or more runs 28 times, and only one pitcher (Dutch Leonard) had an ERA below 4.24. Charles Henry Chick Shorten (April 19, 1892 – October 23, 1965) was an American baseball player.  He played professional baseball as an outfielder for 18 years from 1911 to 1928, including eight seasons in Major League Baseball with the Boston Red Sox (1915–1917), Detroit Tigers (1919–1921), St. Louis Browns (1922), and Cincinnati Reds (1924).  He was a member of the 1916 Red Sox team that won the World Series, and Shorten compiled a .571 batting average in the 1916 World Series.  In eight major league seasons, Shorten appeared in 527 games, including 352 as an outfielder, and compiled a .275 career batting average. In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat.  In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB).  In MLB, a player in each league wins the batting title each season for having the highest batting average that year.  The American League (AL) winner is known as the Rod Carew American League Batting Champion, while the National League (NL) leader is designated the Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion.  Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title.  However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title.  Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs.  Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.

He plays the Sarod.  His Dhrupadee Veenkar style of Ustad Alauddin Khan's Seni Veenkar Gharana: analytically imaginative prosodic progression with metrical waves of melodic phrases interwoven with highest order of technical brilliance and maturity reminds the great legends of the Gharana.  He is an internationally recognized instructor of classical Indian music. The sarod (or sarode) (सरोद) is a stringed instrument of India, used mainly in Indian classical music.  Along with the sitar, it is among the most popular and prominent instruments in Hindustani classical music.  The sarod is known for a deep, weighty, introspective sound, in contrast with the sweet, overtone-rich texture of the sitar, with sympathetic strings that give it a resonant, reverberant quality.  It is a fretless instrument able to produce the continuous slides between notes known as meend (glissandi), which are important in Indian music. Chander Bari is a 2007 Bengali film directed by Tarun Majumdar.  The film centers on a middle class joint family.  The film is based on a Bengali story written by Pracheta Gupta.  Majumdar used some Rabindra Sangeets in this film. The sousaphone ( ), is a brass instrument in the same family as the more widely known tuba.  Created around 1893 by J.W. Pepper at the direction of American bandleader John Philip Sousa (whom the instrument was then named after), it was designed to be easier to play than the concert tuba while standing or marching, as well as to carry the sound of the instrument above the heads of the band.  Like the tuba, sound is produced by moving air past the lips, causing them to vibrate or buzz into a large cupped mouthpiece.  Unlike the tuba, the instrument is bent in a circle to fit around the body of the musician; it ends in a large, flaring bell that is pointed forward, projecting the sound ahead of the player.  Because of the ease of carrying and the direction of sound, it is widely employed in marching bands, as well as various other musical genres.  Sousaphones were originally made out of brass but in the mid-20th century started to be made from lighter materials like fiberglass; today both types are in wide use. A bukkehorn (Norwegian) or bockhorn (Swedish), also called ″Billy Goat Horn″ in English, is an ancient Scandinavian musical instrument, made from the horn of a ram or a goat.  The horn is usually made from a goat horn harvested 5 to 7 years before the instrument is crafted.  It was traditionally used by shepherds and milkmaids on summer dairy farms in the mountains, as a signal-instrument or as a scaring instrument.  When the horn later got finger holes it became possible to play melodies with it.  The instrument has two blowing-techniques: the trumpet-principle is the most common, but the clarinet-principle is also used. An experimental musical instrument (or custom-made instrument) is a musical instrument that modifies or extends an existing instrument or class of instruments, or defines or creates a new class of instrument.  Some are created through simple modifications, such as cracked drum cymbals or metal objects inserted between piano strings in a prepared piano.  Some experimental instruments are created from household items like a homemade mute for brass instruments such as bathtub plugs.  Other experimental instruments are created from electronic spare parts, or by mixing acoustic instruments with electric components. Udaka Vadya is an Indian musical instrument.  It is assumed either this musical instruments had been Jal tarang or similar to it.  This percussion instrument has been categorized in medieval musical treatise under Ghan Vadya (diophonic instruments where the sound is produced by striking a surface).  This instrument has been mentioned in Vatsyayana's Kamasutra, also Sangeeta Parijata of the 17th century mentioned about this instrument.  The skill to play this instrument was one of the essential 64 kala to be learnt by a woman. The keyboard glockenspiel (French: jeu de timbre) or organ glockenspiel is an instrument consisting of a glockenspiel operated by a piano keyboard.  It was first used by George Frideric Handel in the oratorio Saul (1739).  It was also used in the 1739 revivals of his Il Trionfo del Tempo and Acis and Galatea, and the next year in L'Allegro, il Penseroso ed il Moderato.  Half a century later, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart employed a strumento d’acciaio in The Magic Flute (1791) to represent Papageno's magic bells, and this instrument is believed to have been a keyboard glockenspiel.  This part is nowadays sometimes taken by a celesta.  Maurice Ravel preferred the keyboard version of the instrument because it can play a true ff dynamic for brilliance and iridescence in orchestral climaxes.  In the late 20th century, the firm of Bergerault began manufacturing a three-octave (F2–E4) mallet instrument with a damping mechanism operated by a foot pedal, which is capable of dealing with the wide range called for in contemporary scores. An asset class is a group of instruments which have similar financial characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace.  We can often break these instruments into those having to do with real assets and those having to do with financial assets.  Often, assets within the same asset class are subject to the same laws and regulations; however, this is not always true.  For instance, futures on an asset are often considered part of the same asset class as the underlying instrument but are subject to different regulations than the underlying instrument. Accompaniment is the musical parts which provide the rhythmic and/or harmonic support for the melody or main themes of a song or instrumental piece.  There are many different styles and types of accompaniment in different genres and styles of music.  In homophonic music, the main accompaniment approach used in popular music, a clear vocal melody is supported by subordinate chords.  In popular music and traditional music, the accompaniment parts typically provide the beat for the music and outline the chord progression of the song or instrumental piece.  The accompaniment for a vocal melody or instrumental solo can be played by a single musician playing an instrument such as piano, pipe organ, or guitar.  While any instrument can in theory be used as an accompaniment instrument, keyboard and guitar-family instruments tend to be used if there is only a single instrument, as these instruments can play chords and basslines simultaneously (chords and a bassline are easier to play simultaneously on keyboard instruments, but a fingerpicking guitarist can play chords and a bassline simultaneously on guitar).  A solo singer can accompany herself by playing guitar or piano while she sings, and in some rare cases, a solo singer can even accompany himself or herself just using his or her voice and body (e.g., Bobby McFerrin).

The bukkehorn, also known as the Billy Goat Horn, is an ancient Scandinavian instrument made from a ram or goat's horn, used by shepherds and milkmaids for signaling and scaring purposes.

Experimental musical instruments, such as those created through simple modifications or electronic spare parts, extend or modify existing instruments or create new ones.

In terms of asset classes, instruments can be grouped based on their financial characteristics and market behavior. Real assets and financial assets are two common categories, with assets within each class subject to different laws and regulations. Accompaniment, or the musical parts that provide rhythmic and harmonic support for the melody or main themes, is a crucial aspect of many genres and styles of music. In popular music, accompaniment parts typically provide the beat and outline the chord progression, and can be played by a single instrument such as piano or guitar.

For Bergson, reality occurs not in a series of discrete states but as a process similar to that described by process philosophy or the Greek philosopher Heraclitus.  Reality is fluid and cannot be completely understood through reductionistic analysis, which he said implies that we go around an object, gaining knowledge from various perspectives which are relative.  Instead, reality can be grasped absolutely only through intuition, which Bergson expressed as entering into the object. Duration (French: la durée) is a theory of time and consciousness posited by the French philosopher Henri Bergson.  Bergson sought to improve upon inadequacies he perceived in the philosophy of Herbert Spencer, due, he believed, to Spencer's lack of comprehension of mechanics, which led Bergson to the conclusion that time eluded mathematics and science.  Bergson became aware that the moment one attempted to measure a moment, it would be gone: one measures an immobile, complete line, whereas time is mobile and incomplete.  For the individual, time may speed up or slow down, whereas, for science, it would remain the same.  Hence Bergson decided to explore the inner life of man, which is a kind of duration, neither a unity nor a quantitative multiplicity.  Duration is ineffable and can only be shown indirectly through images that can never reveal a complete picture.  It can only be grasped through a simple intuition of the imagination. Samuel Eliot Morison, (July 9, 1887 – May 15, 1976) was an American historian noted for his works of maritime history and American history that were both authoritative and popular.  He received his Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1912, and taught history at the university for 40 years.  He won Pulitzer Prizes for Admiral of the Ocean Sea (1942), a biography of Christopher Columbus, and John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography (1959).  In 1942, he was commissioned to write a history of United States naval operations in World War II, which was published in 15 volumes between 1947 and 1962.  Morison wrote the popular Oxford History of the American People (1965), and co-authored the classic textbook The Growth of the American Republic (1930) with Henry Steele Commager.  Over the course of his distinguished career, Morison received eleven honorary doctoral degrees, and garnered numerous literary prizes, military honors, and national awards from both foreign countries and the United States, including two Pulitzer Prizes, two Bancroft Prizes, the Balzan Prize, the Legion of Merit, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The 2011 Pulitzer Prizes were announced on Monday, April 18, 2011.  The Los Angeles Times won two prizes, including the highest honor for Public Service.  The New York Times also won two awards.  No prize was handed out in the Breaking News category.  The Wall Street Journal won an award for the first time since 2007.  Jennifer Egan's A Visit From the Goon Squad picked up the Fiction prize after already winning the 2010 National Book Critics Circle Award.  Photographer Carol Guzy of The Washington Post became the first journalist to win four Pulitzer Prizes. Henri-Louis Bergson (] ; 18 October 1859 – 4 January 1941) was a French philosopher, influential especially in the first half of the 20th century and after WWII in continental philosophy. Thomas Loren Friedman (born July 20, 1953) is an American journalist and author.  He is a three time Pulitzer Prize winner. Élan vital (] ) is a term coined by French philosopher Henri Bergson in his 1907 book Creative Evolution, in which he addresses the question of self-organisation and spontaneous morphogenesis of things in an increasingly complex manner.  Elan vital was translated in the English edition as vital impetus, but is usually translated by his detractors as vital force.  It is a hypothetical explanation for evolution and development of organisms, which Bergson linked closely with consciousness – with the intuitive perception of experience and the flow of inner time. Time and Free Will: An Essay on the Immediate Data of Consciousness (French: Essai sur les données immédiates de la conscience) is Henri Bergson's doctoral thesis, first published in 1889.  The essay deals with the problem of free will, which Bergson contends is merely a common confusion among philosophers caused by an illegitimate translation of the unextended into the extended, as a means of introducing his theory of duration, which would become highly influential among continental philosophers in the following century. Moina Mathers, born Mina Bergson (28 February 1865 – 25 July 1928), was an artist and occultist at the turn of the 20th century.  She was the sister of French philosopher Henri Bergson, the first man of Jewish descent to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1927.  She is, however, more known for her marriage to the English occultist, Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, one of the founders of the organisation Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and, after his death in 1918, for being the head of a successor organisation, called the Rosicrucian Order of the Alpha et Omega. Matter and Memory (French: Matière et mémoire, 1896) is a book by the French philosopher Henri Bergson.  Its subtitle is Essay on the relation of body and spirit (Essai sur la relation du corps à l’esprit), and the work presents an analysis of the classical philosophical problems concerning this relation.  Within that frame the analysis of memory serves the purpose of clarifying the problem.  Matter and Memory was written in reaction to the book The Maladies of Memory by Théodule Ribot, which appeared in 1881.  Ribot claimed that the findings of brain science proved that memory is lodged within a particular part of the nervous system; localized within the brain and thus being of a material nature.  Bergson was opposed to this reduction of spirit to matter.  Defending a clear anti-reductionist position, he considered memory to be of a deeply spiritual nature, the brain serving the need of orienting present action by inserting relevant memories.  The brain thus being of a practical nature, certain lesions tend to perturb this practical function, but without erasing memory as such.  The memories are, instead, simply not 'incarnated', and cannot serve their purpose. [/INST]

  Rephrased paragraph:

Henri Bergson's philosophical work, "Introduction to Metaphysics," challenges the idea that reality can be understood through reductionistic analysis. Instead, Bergson argues that reality is a fluid process, and that intuition is necessary to grasp it fully. Bergson's theories on time and consciousness, as expressed in "Duration" and "Time and Free Will," emphasize the importance of understanding the inner life of man and the role of consciousness in shaping our experience of time. Samuel Eliot Morison, an American historian and author, wrote extensively on maritime history and American history, and received numerous literary prizes, including two Pulitzer Prizes. Henri Bergson's sister, Moina Mathers, was an artist and occultist who was known for her marriage to Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, one of the founders of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. Bergson's book "Matter and Memory" explores the relationship between body and spirit, and argues against reducing spirit to matter. Instead, Bergson posits that memory is a deeply spiritual aspect of consciousness, and that the brain serves a practical purpose in orienting present action through the insertion of relevant memories.
